        "news_article = \"\"\"REDMOND, Wash. (AP) — Microsoft wants laptop users to get so comfortable with its artificial intelligence chatbot that it will remember everything you're doing on your computer and help figure out what you want to do next. The software giant on Monday revealed a new class of AI-imbued personal computers as it confronts heightened competition from Big Tech rivals in pitching generative AI technology that can compose documents, make images and serve as a lifelike personal assistant at work or home. The announcements ahead of Microsoft's annual Build developer conference centered on fusing its AI assistant, called Copilot, into the Windows operating system for PCs, where Microsoft already has the eyes of millions of consumers. The new features will include Windows Recall, giving the AI assistant what Microsoft describes as “photographic memory” of a person's virtual activity. Microsoft promises to protect users' privacy by giving them the option to filter out what they don't want tracked, and keeping the tracking on the device. It's a step toward machines that “instantly see us, hear, reason about our intent and our surroundings,” said CEO Satya Nadella. “We’re entering this new era where computers not only understand us, but can actually anticipate what we want and our intent,\" Nadella said at an event at the company's headquarters in Redmond, Washington. The conference that starts Tuesday in Seattle follows big AI announcements last week from rival Google, as well as Microsoft's close business partner OpenAI, which built the AI large language models on which Microsoft's Copilot is based. Google rolled out a retooled search engine that periodically puts AI-generated summaries over website links at the top of the results page; while also showing off a still-in-development AI assistant Astra that will be able to “see” and converse about things shown through a smartphone’s camera lens. ChatGPT-maker OpenAI unveiled a new version of its chatbot last week, demonstrating an AI voice assistant with human characteristics that can banter about what someone's wearing and even attempt to assess a person’s emotions. The voice sounded so much like Scarlett Johansson playing an AI character in the sci-fi movie “Her” that OpenAI dropped the voice from its collection Monday. OpenAI also rolled out a new desktop version of ChatGPT designed for Apple's Mac computers.\"\"\"\n",

        "news_article = \"\"\"The launch of Apple’s Vision Pro headset has been perhaps the most controversial in its recent history – certainly, the biggest pivot since the company moved into the telecommunications market with the launch of the iPhone in 2007. Presenting the innovation at the time, then-CEO Steve Jobs claimed that it would “reinvent the phone.” Boy, was he right. Current CEO Tim Cook is betting the magic is still there with the Vision Pro – and he’s making many of the same branding and messaging plays that proved so successful for his predecessor, even while the apps, as use cases that prove the technology, are still in their earliest stages of development. This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's Web3 Marketing Week. Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates. Apple Vision Pro is a headset, but you won’t find that word on the product’s landing page. Neither does Apple doesn’t overly concern itself with terms like augmented reality, extended reality, or mixed reality, even though those technologies are the essence of what the Vision Pro does. Instead, Apple chooses to tell you about how the Vision Pro enables you to enjoy immersive entertainment experiences from your sofa, capture and relive your precious moments as 3D photos and collaborate with remote colleagues as seamlessly as if you were in the same room. This is Apple’s secret sauce. It doesn’t tell us why we need the technology – it shows us why we want what it can do. This simple yet impactful communication strategy was instrumental in the widespread adoption of smartphones – and it already seems to be working for the Vision Pro. The device launched to U.S. consumers in February with an initial user base of up to 200,000 based on sales. If that seems underwhelming, then game engine giant Unity announced support for VisionOS from the moment of its release and there are further plans to roll out the device to the tech-hungry Chinese market later this year. Like spatial computing, Web3 is also an umbrella term, liberally thrown together with terms like blockchain, digital assets, DeFi and the rest of the crypto-jargon dictionary. But most people embedded in the crypto sphere have little grasp of how meaningless these words are to the lay person – and it’s not for a want of understanding their implications. Assuredly, the tech is appealing: a global survey carried out by Consensys found that 83% of respondents prioritize data privacy, 70% think they should share in the profits made from their data and 79% desire greater control over their online identities. Thus, the core values of Web3 are a vote-winner with the general public. Yet a disconnect remains: people support the ideology of Web3 without realizing what it is or how they can incorporate it into their lives. At the moment, the industry is an echo chamber with companies preaching to the converted using an esoteric lingua franca that resonates with a small audience of switched-on, tech-savvy users and crypto-native investors. To make good on the promise of Web3, there needs to be a shift towards more accessible, relatable messaging.\"\"\"\n",

        "00:06:16.860 First, some of them aretiny, just two Saturn masses\n",
        "00:06:20.670 and second, 9% of them come in pairs\n",
        "00:06:24.420 or even in triples.\n",
        "00:06:26.010 Let's take the binary thing first.\n",
        "00:06:27.990 So these are Jupiter mass binary objects\n",
        "00:06:31.080 or jumbos as the teamplayfully dubbed them,\n",
        "00:06:34.140 but how the dues did those form?\n",
        "00:06:37.080 Well, we know that binarystars are certainly very common\n",
        "00:06:40.650 for stars more massive than our sun,\n",
        "00:06:42.420 it's actually kind of weird not\n",

        "00:06:46.080 For sun-like stars though,\n",
        "00:06:47.460 the binary fraction drops to around 60%\n",
        "00:06:50.580 and as we slide down in mass,that fraction keeps falling.\n",
        "00:06:54.930 By the time you get to thesmallest stars, it's around 20%\n",
        "00:06:58.590 and it plummets all the way down to 8%\n",
        "00:07:00.930 for the lightest brown dwarfs.\n",
        "00:07:02.880 So based on this, our expectation was\n",
        "00:07:04.980 that the binary fraction\n",
        "00:07:06.450 for rogue planets should be nearly zero.\n",
        "00:07:09.330 Yet here it's comingout at a respectable 9%.\n",
        "00:07:13.260 Now, a caveat with all ofthis is that JWST as powerful\n",
        "00:07:17.100 as it is, cannot resolvebinaries which are\n",
        "00:07:19.350 too close together.\n",
        "00:07:21.000 The resolving power ofthe telescope here equates\n",
        "00:07:23.280 to about 25 astronomical units.\n",
        "00:07:26.040 That's close to Uranus's orbitalseparation around the sun.\n",
        "00:07:29.430 So these jumbos could be just the tip\n",
        "00:07:31.470 of the iceberg, merely thewidest separated examples,\n",
        "00:07:34.182 and many of those apparentlyisolated plants could in fact\n",

        "00:07:47.490 we see this startling turnoverat around 30 Jupiter masses.\n",
        "00:07:51.840 That turnover is critical and profound.\n",
        "00:07:55.410 It is telling us that somethingis different about the way\n",

        "00:08:01.560 They are not part ofsome smooth continuum,\n",
        "00:08:04.800 but represent a distinct population.\n",
        "00:08:07.680 Before these reports cameout, I think most of us assume\n",
        "00:08:10.440 that rogue plants like thiscould occasionally form the same\n",

        "00:08:16.170 of interstellar gascollapsing under gravity.\n",

        "00:08:25.800 that JWST sees evidence for?\n",
        "00:08:27.750 Theory says no.\n",
        "00:08:29.400 The smallest masses formed in3D simulations this way are\n",
        "00:08:32.220 about seven to 10 Jupiter masses, an order\n",
        "00:08:35.370 of magnitude discrepancy.\n",
        "00:08:37.470 There's just not enoughgravitational mass to form a Saturn\n",
        "00:08:41.190 or even a Jupiter this way.\n",
        "00:08:44.039 If they don't form like stars,\n",
        "00:08:46.020 then perhaps they form like planets.\n",
        "00:08:48.660 Indeed, perhaps they werenot always rogue planets,\n",
        "00:08:51.390 but were ejected from their home system.\n",
        "00:08:54.060 After all. That's an ideawe've seen was already proposed\n",
        "00:08:56.370 for our own solar system.\n",
        "00:08:57.990 This seems like our best guess,\n",
        "00:08:59.460 but it comes with a couple of headaches.\n",
        "00:09:01.260 Remember that many of theseobjects are found in binaries\n",
        "00:09:04.560 and although we have no problem imagining\n",

        "00:09:09.200 of plants from a system\n",

        "00:09:12.196 is really difficult to imagine.\n",
        "00:09:15.114 Now, theorists arediving into this problem\n",
        "00:09:17.760 since the result came out.\n",
        "00:09:19.320 In one recent paper byWang et al, they suggest\n",
        "00:09:22.200 that a stellar flyby couldrip off a pair of Jupiters\n",
        "00:09:25.170 and form a jumbo ifthe two plants happened\n",
        "00:09:28.050 to be closely alignedduring the encounter.\n",
        "00:09:30.600 In another paper coming out of Leiden,\n",
        "00:09:32.640 they suggest thatejections just don't work\n",
        "00:09:35.310 and you really do need to formthem in pairs to begin with,\n",
        "00:09:39.150 so the jury is still out on this one.\n",
        "00:09:42.180 To me, this puzzle has been exacerbated\n",
        "00:09:44.160 by a result from justa couple of weeks ago\n",
        "00:09:46.140 by the newly commissionedEuclid Space telescope.\n",
        "00:09:49.350 Pointing again at the nearbySigma Orionis cluster,\n",

        "00:10:10.860 then generally we expectbig stuff to be rare,\n",

        "00:10:30.240 Eventually, the simulations predict\n",
        "00:10:31.710 that there's simply notenough gravitational mass\n",
        "00:10:33.630 to keep forming things this way.\n",
        "00:10:35.280 So as noted earlier,we expect this process\n",

        "00:10:57.450 Now, the JWST team didn'tmake an IMF like this,\n",

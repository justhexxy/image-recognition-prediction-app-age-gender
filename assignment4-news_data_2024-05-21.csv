Microsoft's AI chatbot will 'recall' everything you do on a PC,20/5/2024 21:55,"MATT O'BRIEN, MANUEL VALDESUpdated 20 May 2024 at 2:55 pm·3-min read","REDMOND, Wash. (AP) — Microsoft wants laptop users to get so comfortable with its artificial intelligence chatbot that it will remember everything you're doing on your computer and help figure out what you want to do next. The software giant on Monday revealed a new class of AI-imbued personal computers as it confronts heightened competition from Big Tech rivals in pitching generative AI technology that can compose documents, make images and serve as a lifelike personal assistant at work or home. The announcements ahead of Microsoft's annual Build developer conference centered on fusing its AI assistant, called Copilot, into the Windows operating system for PCs, where Microsoft already has the eyes of millions of consumers. The new features will include Windows Recall, giving the AI assistant what Microsoft describes as “photographic memory” of a person's virtual activity. Microsoft promises to protect users' privacy by giving them the option to filter out what they don't want tracked, and keeping the tracking on the device. It's a step toward machines that “instantly see us, hear, reason about our intent and our surroundings,” said CEO Satya Nadella. “We’re entering this new era where computers not only understand us, but can actually anticipate what we want and our intent,"" Nadella said at an event at the company's headquarters in Redmond, Washington. The conference that starts Tuesday in Seattle follows big AI announcements last week from rival Google, as well as Microsoft's close business partner OpenAI, which built the AI large language models on which Microsoft's Copilot is based. Google rolled out a retooled search engine that periodically puts AI-generated summaries over website links at the top of the results page; while also showing off a still-in-development AI assistant Astra that will be able to “see” and converse about things shown through a smartphone’s camera lens. ChatGPT-maker OpenAI unveiled a new version of its chatbot last week, demonstrating an AI voice assistant with human characteristics that can banter about what someone's wearing and even attempt to assess a person’s emotions. The voice sounded so much like Scarlett Johansson playing an AI character in the sci-fi movie “Her” that OpenAI dropped the voice from its collection Monday. OpenAI also rolled out a new desktop version of ChatGPT designed for Apple's Mac computers.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/microsofts-ai-chatbot-recall-everything-185736872.html,AAPL
Web3 Marketing Needs Some of Apple’s Secret Sauce,20/5/2024 14:23,Tomer Sharoni20 May 2024 at 7:23 am·4-min read,"The launch of Apple’s Vision Pro headset has been perhaps the most controversial in its recent history – certainly, the biggest pivot since the company moved into the telecommunications market with the launch of the iPhone in 2007. Presenting the innovation at the time, then-CEO Steve Jobs claimed that it would “reinvent the phone.” Boy, was he right. Current CEO Tim Cook is betting the magic is still there with the Vision Pro – and he’s making many of the same branding and messaging plays that proved so successful for his predecessor, even while the apps, as use cases that prove the technology, are still in their earliest stages of development. This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's Web3 Marketing Week. Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates. Apple Vision Pro is a headset, but you won’t find that word on the product’s landing page. Neither does Apple doesn’t overly concern itself with terms like augmented reality, extended reality, or mixed reality, even though those technologies are the essence of what the Vision Pro does. Instead, Apple chooses to tell you about how the Vision Pro enables you to enjoy immersive entertainment experiences from your sofa, capture and relive your precious moments as 3D photos and collaborate with remote colleagues as seamlessly as if you were in the same room. This is Apple’s secret sauce. It doesn’t tell us why we need the technology – it shows us why we want what it can do. This simple yet impactful communication strategy was instrumental in the widespread adoption of smartphones – and it already seems to be working for the Vision Pro. The device launched to U.S. consumers in February with an initial user base of up to 200,000 based on sales. If that seems underwhelming, then game engine giant Unity announced support for VisionOS from the moment of its release and there are further plans to roll out the device to the tech-hungry Chinese market later this year. Like spatial computing, Web3 is also an umbrella term, liberally thrown together with terms like blockchain, digital assets, DeFi and the rest of the crypto-jargon dictionary. But most people embedded in the crypto sphere have little grasp of how meaningless these words are to the lay person – and it’s not for a want of understanding their implications. Assuredly, the tech is appealing: a global survey carried out by Consensys found that 83% of respondents prioritize data privacy, 70% think they should share in the profits made from their data and 79% desire greater control over their online identities. Thus, the core values of Web3 are a vote-winner with the general public. Yet a disconnect remains: people support the ideology of Web3 without realizing what it is or how they can incorporate it into their lives. At the moment, the industry is an echo chamber with companies preaching to the converted using an esoteric lingua franca that resonates with a small audience of switched-on, tech-savvy users and crypto-native investors. To make good on the promise of Web3, there needs to be a shift towards more accessible, relatable messaging.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/web3-marketing-needs-apple-secret-142336677.html,AAPL

Apple slashes prices of iPhone 15 models to new low in China amid heated competition in world's largest smartphone market,20/5/2024 9:30,South China Morning Post20 May 2024 at 2:30 am·3-min read,"Apple is offering a new range of steep discounts for iPhone 15 models to consumers in mainland China, with online retail platforms bringing prices to a new low amid the US tech giant's efforts to boost sluggish sales in the world's biggest smartphone market. The top-of-the-line 256-gigabyte iPhone 15 Pro Max model, for example, on Monday started selling for 7,949 yuan (US$1,100) on Apple's official online stores on JD.com and Alibaba Group Holding's Tmall platform - down 2,050 yuan, or 20 per cent off, from its 9,999-yuan price tag when the new series was released last September. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post. The basic 128GB iPhone 15 model, meanwhile, now costs 23 per cent less at 4,599 yuan, down from its previous price of 5,999 yuan, on both JD.com and Tmall. The sale runs from May 20 to 28, according to the two platforms. Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

Apple's atypical iPhone discount drive on Chinese online marketplaces started in January, following online and offline campaigns of rival Chinese smartphone vendors - including Xiaomi and Honor - that knocked down prices on their various Android models. Discounts of up to 800 yuan were offered by Apple through its mainland online store in the same month, covering iPhones, iPads, MacBook laptops, AirPods and the Apple Watch.

Apple slashes iPhone prices in China amid fierce Huawei competition,20/5/2024 9:22,Reuters20 May 2024 at 2:22 am·1-min read,"BEIJING (Reuters) — Apple has launched an aggressive discounting campaign on its official Tmall site in China, offering discounts of up to 2,300 yuan ($318) on select iPhone models. The discounting comes as the U.S. tech giant seeks to defend its position in the high-end smartphone market, where it faces increasing competition from local rivals such as Huawei. Running from May 20 to May 28, it is more substantial than the one Apple offered in February. While the highest discount in the February campaign was 1,150 yuan, this time discounts are up to 2,300 yuan. The steepest discount applies to the 1TB iPhone 15 Pro Max model, while other models also see significant price cuts. For instance, the 128 GB version of the base iPhone 15 model has a discount of 1,400 yuan, according to Reuters' checks on Monday. The increased competitive pressure on Apple comes after Huawei last month introduced its new series of high-end smartphones, the Pura 70, following the launch of the Mate 60 last August. Apple's previous discounting effort in February appears to have helped the company mitigate a sales slowdown in China. Apple's shipments in China increased by 12% in March, according to Reuters' calculations based on data from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT). This marks a significant improvement from the first two months of 2024, when the company experienced a 37% slump in sales.

iPad Air M2 review: cheaper iPad Pro for rest of us gets bigger,20/5/2024 6:00,Samuel Gibbs Consumer technology editor19 May 2024 at 11:00 pm·5-min read,"Apple has more options than ever for those after a tablet with different sizes, prices, screens and power, but the iPad Air is fairly simple to understand – it is the premium big-screen iPad for those who don’t want to fork out thousands for an iPad Pro. The Air starts at £599 (€699/$599/A$999) and is now available in two screen sizes: the original 11in and a larger 13in model for big-screen viewing. That puts it right in the middle of Apple’s lineup, with the 10th-gen iPad starting at £349 at the bottom and topped by the new iPad Pro M4 starting at £999. The 11in Air is a straight replacement for the excellent M1 model from 2022, with the same good-looking iPad Pro-like design, the same crisp screen and stereo speakers. The 13in version, as reviewed here, is enlarged by a factor of 1.2 on the diagonal, making it about the same size as previous-generation iPad Pros. The Air’s screen is a significant upgrade on the base-model iPad, being brighter and of higher quality, matching good-quality laptop screens such as those on the MacBook Air or Surface Laptop. But it lacks the more advanced 120Hz miniLED or OLED technology from the iPad Pro line. That means it is not as bright, contrasty or smooth as Apple’s top tablets. Compared side by side, the difference is night and day, but so is the price. The stereo speakers are great for watching TV. The aluminium body and glass front feel solid and are only 1mm thicker than the super slender, 5.1mm thick iPad Pro. The webcam has been moved to the top edge in landscape, which makes for a much-improved video call experience over previous iPads.

The 'Magnificent 7' term needs to be retired after Q1 earnings: Goldman Sachs,18/5/2024 5:39,Investing.com17 May 2024 at 10:39 pm·1-min read,"Goldman Sachs has observed a significant shift among the top technology companies, often dubbed the ""Magnificent 7,"" following their first-quarter results. Collectively, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)., Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc., Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)., Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. saw their profits increase by 48% year-over-year. This growth was supported by a 14% increase in sales and a margin expansion of 521 basis points, bringing the aggregate margin to 22.8%. However, this overall performance conceals the varying fortunes of the individual companies, the analysis showed. Meta Platforms, Alphabet, and Amazon outperformed expectations with sales growth of 27%, 15%, and 13% respectively, leading to year-to-date share price increases of 34%, 25%, and 21%. These gains reflect a stronger market performance for these companies relative to some of their peers. In stark contrast, Apple's sales saw a 4% decline, while Tesla experienced a 9% drop in revenues. Consequently, their stock prices have been impacted, with Apple's shares dipping by 1% and Tesla's plummeting by 30%. This downturn has led to Tesla's ranking falling to the 12th largest stock in the S&P 500 index. ""The sobriquet “Magnificent 7” needs to be retired following 1Q results,"" Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note.

But software still hamstrings the iPad Pro’s true potential, relegating the device to a sleek, high-end package for consuming content rather than allowing the iPad Pro to realize its productivity potential. The company has packed its latest M4 processor with up to 10 CPU and 10 GPU cores, more than you’ll find in its current MacBook Air and at least one version of its MacBook Pro, into a tablet thinner than Apple’s iPod Nano. At just 5.1 millimeters thick, the iPad Pro feels like if you hold it by one end, the other will droop like a piece of loose-leaf paper. It doesn’t, of course. The 11-inch iPad Pro is almost as thin at 5.3 mm. Oh, and then there’s the new Ultra Retina XDR display. Apple says the screen combines two OLED panels to boost its overall brightness while offering the same exceptional benefits you’d get out of a normal OLED display. That means inky blacks and brilliant colors. And all of that is going to cost you. A base 13-inch iPad Pro with Apple’s Magic Keyboard will set you back $1,648. That’s more than a high-end 13-inch MacBook Air and an entry-level MacBook Pro. I could deal with that price, though, if the iPad Pro didn’t have one big setback — iPadOS. Over the years, the iPad has made progress toward offering more Mac-like capabilities. You can run multiple apps at the same time, connect to an external display for a larger workspace, group apps together, and more.

The Cupertino, California-based company is still testing different designs for the device, code-named D23, that could have Apple's latest-generation processor, likely called A19, the report added. Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,17/5/2024 13:00,Zacks Equity Research17 May 2024 at 6:00 am·5-min read,"Apple (AAPL) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term. Over the past month, shares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned +13.7%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry, which Apple falls in, has gained 12.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction? Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision. Revisions to Earnings Estimates Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock. We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. Apple is expected to post earnings of $1.33 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.4%. The consensus earnings estimate of $6.57 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +7.2%. This estimate has changed +0.5% over the last 30 days. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.20 indicates a change of +9.6% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.4%. Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Apple is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-inc-aapl-attracting-investor-130016542.html,AAPL
Is Apple (AAPL) Stanley Druckenmiller’s Best AI Stock Pick?,17/5/2024 12:22,Fahad Saleem17 May 2024 at 5:22 am·4-min read,"Insider Monkey recently analyzed billionaire Druckenmiller's latest Q1'2024 portfolio to see which AI stocks the billionaire was buying. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is part of the 10 Best AI stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller. But the interesting question to answer is: Is Apple really the best AI pick of Druckenmiller? Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller surprised the market when he revealed a new take in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) in his first quarter holdings data. Duquesne Capital bought a $19.6 million stake in Nvidia in the March quarter. After dumping Apple shares in the early 2011, Stanley Druckenmiller never took interest in the stock which remained one of the favorites of hedge funds throughout these years. But his latest move indicates the value investor is expecting a new bull run in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) which is struggling to take off with its AI plans. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares are down about 1% year to date. All eyes are now on Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Worldwide Developers Conference as investors believe Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) will reveal some blockbuster AI plans in the event. The closet Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has come to any meaningful AI offering is its new plan to integrate ChatGPT in its iOS 18. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, a notable Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) bull, called the possible deal between Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and OpenAI a ""golden goose"" for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tim Cook. Ives reiterated a Buy rating on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock with a $250 price target. Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) list of risks is long. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has faced consecutive quarters of revenue declines as its iPhone business, Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) bread and butter so far, continues to face growth challenges amid rising competition in China and customers' lack of enthusiasm to buy new iPhones. Major stakeholders like Warren Buffett are also starting to cut their stakes in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). To turn things around when it comes to the stock price, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) recently announced a historic a $110 billion stock buyback program. But that didn’t move the needle much for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is trading at around 29 times earnings. Estimates suggest Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) expects to make $6.53 a share in FY2024 on about $385.8 billion in sales, while EPS in fiscal 2025 is expected to come in at $7.13. When compared to peers like Microsoft, which are growing at a much faster rate and have their AI roadmap all in place, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock looks overvalued according to many analysts. Unless Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) pulls a miracle or out-of-this-world innovation, iPhone demand isn’t expected to rebound anytime soon due to a plethora of competitors which are making cheaper but quality smartphones, and rising inflation which is hurting consumer buying power. KeyBanc Capital Markets recently said in a report that iPhone demand in April was also ""soft."" Insider Monkey's database shows that 131 out of 933 elite money managers had stakes in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), down from 134 funds in the prior quarter.

"Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Apple, Eli Lilly and Crocs",17/5/2024 9:32,Zacks Equity Research17 May 2024 at 2:32 am·4-min read,"Chicago, IL – May 17, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Apple AAPL, Eli Lilly LLY and Crocs CROX. Earnings season continues to wind down, with the period reflecting positivity. We’ve heard from over 460 S&P 500 companies, with this week’s reporting docket primarily dominated by retail. Total earnings for the S&P 500 members that have reported Q1 results are up +4.8% from the same period last year on +4.1% higher revenues. The earnings growth pace reflects an acceleration relative to other periods, undoubtedly a positive development. Estimates for the coming 2024 Q2 cycle have been trending higher, reflecting optimism among analysts. So far, several companies, including Apple, Eli Lilly and Crocs, have seen post-earnings positivity. Let’s take a closer look at each. Apple Concerning headline figures, the company posted a 1.3% beat relative to the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate and posted sales 1% ahead of expectations. It reflected the company’s fifth consecutive double-beat, owing to its ability to positively surprise investors. Notably, the tech titan announced the biggest buyback in corporate history totaling $110 billion. Reflecting further positivity, Apple also unveiled a 4% boost to its quarterly payout, reflecting the 12th consecutive year of higher payouts. Earnings expectations have increased since the release, reflecting analysts’ optimistic view. The company’s growth profile remains positive, with current expectations alluding to a 7% pop in earnings on modestly higher sales in its current fiscal year (FY24). Peeking ahead to FY25, estimates allude to an additional 9.6% climb in earnings paired with a 5.5% sales bump.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-investment-ideas-feature-highlights-093200886.html,AAPL
"Some of the most talented, high-ranking workers at Apple, Microsoft, and SpaceX jumped ship after return-to-office mandates, new study reveals",16/5/2024 16:02,Jane Thier16 May 2024 at 9:02 am·7-min read,"The focus of return-to-office discussions have long focused on the individuals. Why might workers prefer to stay home? Which age groups are most amenable to in-person work, and which are most combative? Does office collaboration make the most sense for creative types or heads-down numbers people? Can workers really be productive left to their own devices? Yet the lingering question of how widespread remote work shapes company outcomes, as well as the wider sector landscape, largely remains unanswered because the whole experiment remains in flux. But a new working paper from researchers at the University of Michigan and University of Chicago, titled “Return to Office and the Tenure Distribution,” comes fairly close to positing an answer: Return-to-office (RTO) mandates, when they’re not wanted, are bad news for companies looking to keep their talent. The researchers matched 260 million resumes to company data to analyze causal effects of RTO mandates on employees’ tenure at Microsoft, SpaceX, and Apple. In scientific terms, they found “a reduction in counterfactual tenure that increases for employees with longer tenure.” In layman’s terms: When the firms enacted RTO mandates, senior employees headed for the door—often to direct competitors—who let them work from home. The number of top-brass employees at Microsoft—as a share of the company headcount—dropped by over 5% post-mandate; at Apple, it was 4%. (Microsoft mandated 50% of the week in-office; Apple, just one day a week.) SpaceX was the worst of the bunch, with a 15% drop, which the researchers chalk up to its uniquely stringent requirement: Five days a week in-person. That human outflow poses an enduring threat to “productivity, innovation, and competitiveness”—the component parts that separate a thriving company from one in freefall. Microsoft’s internal data doesn’t align with the paper’s findings, Amy Coleman, its vice president of human resources and corporate functions, told Fortune via email. The term “return to office mandate” is also inaccurate, she said, adding that Microsoft is a hybrid workplace “that revolves around flexibility and a mix of workstyles across worksite, work location and work hours.” In 2022, Microsoft’s chief human resources officer Kathleen Hogan told Fortune the company considers “working from home up to 50% of the time as standard.” Representatives for Apple and SpaceX did not respond to Fortune’s request for comment, though an Apple spokesperson told the Washington Post that the study drew “inaccurate conclusions” and “does not reflect the realities” of Apple’s business or attrition rates. The statistical analysis came from People Data Labs resumé data, David Van Dijcke, a coauthor and University of Michigan economics PhD student, tells Fortune. “The takeaway is definitely that the effects [of RTO mandates] are more deleterious than people thought before.” Granted, the study is far from all-encompassing; it only studied three major firms, and they were all “early movers” in the RTO push, Van Dijcke acknowledges, pointing to each of their 2022 mandate announcements. That meant senior employees who left Microsoft, Apple, and SpaceX had “pretty good outside options,” namely competing companies that offered remote work with far fewer strings attached. “If we think of Covid as ending in 2022, that was certainly followed by an influx of people claiming they would leave—and then really leaving when the first return-to-office mandates happened,” Anthony Nyberg, a management professor at the University of South Carolina’s Darla Moore School of Business, tells Fortune. “Apple and Microsoft really agonized over how to change their policies—Amazon, too, made many public comments.” To be sure, Nyberg went on, mandating an office return is a major strategic decision—and even in the Michigan study, which found a statistically significant portion of high-earning workers leaving, it remains unclear whether that’s necessarily a bad thing for their former companies. “A big part of this is likely to become a sorting effect in terms of talent finding their best-fit organizations,” Nyberg says. “And people going to competing companies has been a truism for all of eternity.”",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/most-talented-high-ranking-workers-160212454.html,AAPL

Apple, Chevron Trimmed: Berkshire reduced its Apple position by a little over 116 million. The firm now owns 789,368,450 Apple shares valued at $135.36 billion, a 13F filing shows. This is the second straight quarter that the Buffett-led company has diluted its Apple stake. The iPhone manufacturer remains Berkshire’s top holding. Earlier this month, Buffett — at the annual Berkshire shareholder meeting — said the dilution has to do with footing the tax bill and the desire to hold more cash due to economic uncertainties. After adding 15.9 million Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX) shares in the fourth quarter, the firm sold 3.1 million shares of the oil giant in the first quarter. The latest 13F showed Berkshire owning 112.98 million shares worth $305.70 million.

The 43-second spot released on social media shows a young woman navigating through assorted debris strewn on the floor before stopping at a broken guitar she picks up. Studying sheet music displayed on her Galaxy Tab S9, she begins strumming a few chords, not caring that the damaged instrument is out of tune. “Creativity cannot be crushed,” ran the Samsung ad in a clear dig at its competitor in Cupertino still reeling from a badly conceived advertisement. We would never crush creativity. #UnCrush pic.twitter.com/qvlUqbRlnE — Samsung Mobile US (@SamsungMobileUS) May 15, 2024 In a world where machines could soon prove superior to their creators, Apple thought the best metaphor when selling its first new iPad Pro in nearly two years was a giant hydraulic press figuratively and literally crushing creative tools humanity has relied on for centuries into one ultra-thin Apple tablet—all to a cheerful Sonny and Cher melody. “Just think of all the things it’ll be used to create,” posted a giddy Tim Cook, only to be inundated with 19,000 replies of overwhelmingly angry consumers. People like actor Hugh Grant came away from viewing the ad disgusted at what was viewed as a vulgar and obscene display of Silicon Valley techno-fetishism personally endorsed by Steve Jobs' anointed successor as CEO, Tim Cook. “Steve wouldn’t have shipped that ad,” wrote Paul Graham, who founded startup accelerator Y Combinator. “It would have pained him too much to watch.”",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-disastrous-ipad-ad-mocked-144834332.html,AAPL
"Google, Apple, and Microsoft make their products friendlier to users with disabilities",16/5/2024 14:47,David Meyer16 May 2024 at 7:47 am·3-min read,"It’s Global Accessibility Awareness Day today, and Big Tech firms have accordingly issued a flurry of announcements about how they’ll make their products friendlier to people whose use of devices is hindered by disabilities. Most coverage of Google’s I/O developer event this week may have focused on its generative AI news, but the company also announced an expansion of Project Gameface to the Android platform. Google announced that project last year—it’s an open-source, hands-free gaming “mouse” that uses the webcam to capture the gamer’s head movements and facial gestures, translating them into cursor movements via the magic of machine learning. Now Google is open-sourcing more of the code so developers can make better Android accessibility apps. Gaming may have been the inspiration for Project Gameface—specifically, the needs of a gaming streamer named Lance Carr, who has muscular dystrophy—but the applications clearly go far beyond, with Google promising use cases in educational and work settings too. In a similar vein, Apple yesterday also announced an upcoming iPhone and iPad feature called Eye Tracking. This does what the name suggests, giving users a way to navigate through and activate the elements of an app, just by letting the front-facing camera track their eye movements. Apple also revealed other accessibility features that will be coming soon: Music Haptics, which will help deaf or hard-of-hearing iPhone users experience music with the aid of “taps, textures, and refined vibrations”; Vocal Shortcuts, which will let users trigger complex tasks by uttering simple sounds; and a bunch of new accessibility features specific to the CarPlay and visionOS environments. Meanwhile, on the intriguing-hardware front, we have Microsoft’s announcement yesterday of the Proteus controller for Xbox and PC gamers. Designed by peripherals startup ByoWave, the Proteus is a kit comprising “snap and play” parts that let people customize a wireless controller according to their needs. There’s a “mother cube” that serves as the controller’s brain, a cube features the directional pad, a piece with a mini control stick, another two providing left and right triggers, and so on. There are many possible configurations, from traditional controller layouts to wand-like columns and tabletop-friendly rectangles. Preorders are open now, with the kit ($255 to first-comers, $299 thereafter) shipping in the fall. Microsoft also used the occasion of Global Accessibility Awareness Day to promise fixes for what some gamers with disabilities experienced from a major change that the company made last November when it started blocking the use of unauthorized accessories with the Xbox console. This has been an issue for those who had put together custom controller setups to fit their unique requirements, with equipment coming from small specialist manufacturers that aren’t official Microsoft licensees. Part of Microsoft’s solution is for those manufacturers to get in touch and make their controllers official, but the company is also updating its own Adaptive Controller, which the Xbox always accepts, to expand support for more accessories. The $99 Adaptive Controller is a clever piece of gear that includes some built-in controller functionality of its own, but more importantly acts as a hub for specialized equipment, such as switches that are controlled by biting, sipping, and puffing with the mouth, or with one's feet. “We appreciate and acknowledge that gaming with a disability is highly individualistic, and the solution for one may not be the solution for all,” the company said.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/google-apple-microsoft-products-friendlier-144738151.html,AAPL
Warren Buffett’s Top Favorite Stocks for 2024,16/5/2024 12:55,Fahad Saleem16 May 2024 at 5:55 am·7-min read,"Warren Buffett's Q1'2024 stock holdings data is out and the market is inundated with excitement around the Oracle of Omaha's favorite stock picks. But unlike many other hedge funds which are fickle and revisit their investments regularly, Buffett believes in buying stocks and then holding on to them for decades. But over the past several months the market remained guessing the name of the ""mystery stock"" in Warren Buffett's portfolio he hadn’t revealed. Berkshire had requested SEC for confidentiality as it was busy buying large stakes in the company. Some said it would be Alphabet, some speculated it would be a Chinese stock (Alibaba was the favorite candidate). But many wise investors said the would be from the insurance and finance industry as Buffett has time and again indicated his preference for companies that are doing what he knows the best: insurance, banks, finance. Finally, Berkshire has revealed this mystery stock pick and it's part of our detailed list of Top 7 Favorite Stocks of Warren Buffett for 2024. At the latest annual meeting of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett revealed that is firm's cash piles had swelled to about $189 billion at the end of the first quarter, with him expecting the kitty to hit $200 billion by the end of the second quarter of 2024. This begs the question: why isn’t Buffett deploying this cash? After all he was the one who once said: “Today people who hold cash equivalents feel comfortable. They shouldn't. They have opted for a terrible long-term asset, one that pays virtually nothing and is certain to depreciate in value."" Buffett's reasoning is simple: he only invests when he finds attractive deals with ""eye-popping"" returns, and the market today just isn’t presenting him with any worthy opportunities. In his 2023 investor letter, Buffett went as far as to say that he sees ""no possibility of eye-popping performance"" in the current environment. Buffett always sticks to his core investing principle: never invest in overvalued equities. In his latest investor letter he reiterated that for him to invest in companies, they have to be ""attractively priced."" The Size Factor Another reason Berkshire isn’t deploying cash is its size and Buffett's inclination towards investing only for significant gains. ""Those days are long behind us; size did us in, though increased competition for purchases was also a factor. Berkshire now has – by far – the largest GAAP net worth recorded by any American business.""",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-top-favorite-stocks-125516289.html,AAPL

Note: The following is an excerpt from this week’s Earnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>> Here are the key points: What we saw in the Q1 earnings season is a resilient and steadily improving profitability picture, both in terms of the growth rate as well as the evolving revisions trend. Positive revenue surprises were a bit less commonplace relative to other recent periods, but margins expanded at a better-than-expected rate. Total earnings for the 461 S&P 500 members that have reported Q1 results are up +4.8% from the same period last year on +4.1% higher revenues, with 77.4% beating EPS estimates and 59.7% beating revenue estimates. The earnings and revenue growth pace for these 461 index members represents a modest acceleration from what we had seen in other recent periods. The +4.8% Q1 earnings growth pace improves to +11.4% once the Energy sector and Bristol Myers’s one-time charge are accounted for. For 2024 Q2, S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +9.1% from the same period last year on +4.5% higher revenues. Estimates have been increasing since the start of April, with the current +9.1% earnings growth pace up from +8.7% on April 3rd. In recent weeks, we have consistently flagged signs of improvement in the overall revisions trend, with estimates starting to go modestly up. We are seeing this trend for the current period (2024 Q2) as well as for full-year 2024 estimates. We started seeing this favorable turn in the revisions trend roughly around when the Q1 earnings reports started coming out. That said, several sectors, including Tech and Retail, had already been enjoying positive estimate revisions for quite some time. At present, half of the 16 Zacks sectors have higher aggregate earnings estimates than expected at the start of the year. We have recently highlighted the favorable revisions trend for the Energy sector in this space.

D.C. is testing its Big Tech antitrust campaign far from D.C.,16/5/2024 8:00,Alexis Keenan·Reporter16 May 2024 at 1:00 am·6-min read,"The Biden administration is testing its antitrust push far from Washington as it seeks to unwind the dominance of Big Tech. No longer is the nation’s capital the go-to trial venue of choice for the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission as they file competition challenges against the biggest names in Silicon Valley. Instead, it’s New Jersey where the government chose to sue Apple (AAPL). Or California, where it challenged Microsoft (MSFT). Or the state of Washington, where it confronted Amazon (AMZN). Or Virginia, where it filed a second antitrust suit against Google (GOOG, GOOGL). ""They’re clearly filing these tech cases in different jurisdictions where the law is less developed,"" said Douglas Ross, a professor of antitrust at the University of Washington School of Law. ""And they're doing it for a reason."" A variety of strategies could explain the multi-jurisdictional approach, according to antitrust lawyers. Prosecutors could be targeting appeals courts with case law more favorable to their legal theories, since all of the district courts selected by Biden’s FTC and DOJ report to different courts of appeals. The government could also be weighing the speed of a court in handling litigation and the convenience to anticipated witnesses, said Juan Arteaga, a partner with Crowell & Moring’s antitrust litigation division. It’s also possible, he added, that government officials may want to showcase vigorous anticompetitive enforcement to the rest of the country. ""I think the current leadership team and the DOJ antitrust division have really made it a point to try to take antitrust enforcement out of the D.C. bubble,"" Arteaga said.

"Hedge fund Coatue scraps its Apple stake in Q1, while Viking built its position",15/5/2024 23:26,Carolina Mandl15 May 2024 at 4:26 pm·2-min read,"By Carolina Mandl NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hedge fund Coatue Management dissolved its stake in Apple Inc in the first quarter while Viking Global Investors built a sizeable new position, securities filings showed on Wednesday. Coatue, founded by Philippe Laffont, had 2.4 million shares of Apple in December, worth $470.6 million. Regulatory filings showed it had dissolved that stake entirely by the end of March. Apple's shares plunged almost 11% in the first quarter as the company faced fiercer competition in China and falling revenues. Shares in the iPhone maker have pared losses in the second quarter and are now down 1.5% year to date. Other big investors have cut their stakes in Apple. Earlier this month, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway said it had trimmed its position by 13%. Still, Buffett praised the company during Berkshire's annual meeting, saying the iPhone was ""one of the greatest products."" Coatue's filing also showed it reduced its stake in chipmaking giant Nvidia by roughly 68% to 1.4 million shares, or $1.2 billion. Year to date, shares in Nvidia are up 91%. Coatue also trimmed its position in electric vehicle maker Tesla by 37% to 2.6 million shares. The company's shares are down almost 30% this year amid fierce competition and slowing sales. Coatue, however, more than doubled its holdings in Google-parent Alphabet, to 5.7 million shares. Conversely, Viking showed in the filing a new $663.8 million stake in Apple and a similar position in Microsoft. The funds' positions were revealed in quarterly securities fillings known as 13Fs. While backward looking, these snapshots show what funds owned on the last day of the quarter and are one of the few ways hedge funds and other institutional investors have to declare their positions. The filings do not indicate exact timing of purchases or sales and may not reflect current holdings. Both Coatue and Viking are so-called Tiger cubs, hedge funds seeded by veteran investor Julian Robertson, founder of Tiger Management.

Google is reinventing itself for the AI age,15/5/2024 17:54,Daniel Howley·Technology Editor15 May 2024 at 10:54 am·4-min read,"MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. — Google (GOOG, GOOGL) is in the midst of a full-blown AI evolution. On Tuesday, the company announced a flurry of AI products and services during its I/O developer conference with the aim of repositioning itself as the world’s AI software leader. “We are fully in our Gemini era,” CEO Sundar Pichai said during his keynote, referring to the company’s latest Gemini AI models, while noting that AI is still “in the very early days of the AI platform shift.” For years, Google was considered Silicon Valley’s AI powerhouse. But OpenAI and Microsoft (MSFT) threw the company off course, entering into a multibillion-dollar, multiyear partnership in 2023 that saw Microsoft integrate OpenAI’s most advanced models into its productivity, search, and cloud products. All this helped crown Microsoft as the world’s most valuable company earlier this year. Google’s climb back hasn’t been easy. It originally debuted a ChatGPT competitor called Bard that fell short of initial expectations. And more recently, it bungled the rollout of its generative AI-powered image generator, a tool that the company admitted was not “working the way we intended.” Stealing back the AI throne starts with Google reinventing its most important product: Search. Now — or soon, as it’s rolling out over time — at the top of the screen, you’ll find a generative AI-powered area called AI Overview that offers summarized responses to queries along with links to the sources. It’s a major departure for Google and could impact everything from the company’s advertisers, its main source of revenue, to websites that rely on the firm for search traffic, such as travel platforms and media organizations. While the Search changes are easily the biggest updates to Google’s public-facing products, they weren’t the only consequential announcements at the show. Google also showed off a new AI-powered prototype assistant called Project Astra. During a pre-recorded stage demo, the platform, which views content streamed through your smartphone camera, was able to identify objects, solve programming problems, and more.

Forget iPhone: 4 Reasons to Bet on Apple ETFs,15/5/2024 17:00,Sanghamitra Saha15 May 2024 at 10:00 am·3-min read,"Apple Inc. AAPL has been an underperformer this year with a flat performance, falling short of other mega-cap technology companies. Investors should note that Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF MAGS has jumped 23.6% this year while Apple is up 0.9%. Apple's lesser exposure to AI within the “Magnificent Seven” group and concerns over the sales growth of iPhone in the key China market are being held responsible for this lackluster performance. Apple, in fact, faced a huge setback in China's smartphone market during the first quarter of the year, experiencing a 19% decline in shipments, its worst performance since 2020, per Reuters. This decline was due to the direct impact of Huawei's new product launches in the premium segment. Apple's share in China's smartphone market plunged to 15.7% from 19.7% a year earlier, placing it almost neck-and-neck with Huawei, which saw a remarkable 70% increase in sales. As a result, Apple lost its position as the top smartphone seller in China and slipped to the third place. Should we look beyond this weakness and dig deeper into other areas of strength? Apple recently unveiled its latest iPad Pros featuring the all-new M4 processor, which promises enhanced performance across various aspects, including AI capabilities. Apple directly challenged competitors like Intel, AMD and Qualcomm by asserting that the M4's neural engine surpasses any other neural processing unit in AI PCs. This move indicates Apple's ambition to lead in AI technology, particularly in the realm of consumer devices. Apple’s heavy investment in AI and CEO Tim Cook's increasing mentions of it indicate a strategic focus on the development of the technology. This includes acquiring smaller AI firms and exploring partnerships with industry leaders like OpenAI and Google. Analysts anticipate that Apple's advancements in generative AI will drive iPhone sales by introducing compelling new features. As consumers hold onto their devices for longer periods, innovative AI experiences could serve as a significant differentiator between iPhone generations. Moreover, Apple's overall quarterly revenues fell in Q2, but less than what analysts had expected, and Tim Cook expects revenue growth to resume in the current quarter. In the last reported quarter, sales in Greater China, Apple's third-largest region, fell by 8% to $16.37 billion. The figure surpassed FactSet analysts’ anticipated sales of $15.25 billion. This performance may alleviate concerns among investors about Apple losing market share to local competitors.

Apple brings eye tracking to iPhone and iPad in accessibility update,15/5/2024 16:45,"Martyn Landi, PA Technology Correspondent15 May 2024 at 9:45 am·2-min read","Apple is to enable eye tracking on the iPhone and iPad as part of a new range of accessibility tools aimed at helping those with physical disabilities to more easily use their devices. Using artificial intelligence, it will allow users to navigate their Apple device using just their eyes. The new feature is joined by a new Music Haptics tool, which uses the taptic engine in the iPhone – which powers the vibrations on the device – to enable those who are deaf or hard of hearing to experience music vibrating to the audio of the music. Apple said it was also introducing new speech features which enable users to assign custom utterances to virtual assistant Siri to help with shortcuts to apps, aimed at those with conditions that affect their speech. The eye-tracking tool uses the front-facing camera on the iPhone or iPad to set up and calibrate, and does not require any additional hardware or software. The AI processing to enable eye tracking also takes place on-device, Apple said. “We believe deeply in the transformative power of innovation to enrich lives,” Apple chief executive Tim Cook said. “That’s why for nearly 40 years, Apple has championed inclusive design by embedding accessibility at the core of our hardware and software. “We’re continuously pushing the boundaries of technology, and these new features reflect our long-standing commitment to delivering the best possible experience to all of our users.” Also among the suite of new features announced by the tech giant was a feature the firm says could reduce motion sickness for passengers in moving vehicles.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-brings-eye-tracking-iphone-164515629.html,AAPL
India's Redington posts 5% rise in quarterly profit on gadgets demand,15/5/2024 15:07,Reuters15 May 2024 at 8:07 am·1-min read,"BENGALURU, May 15 (Reuters) - Indian IT products distributor Redington reported a 5% rise in quarterly profit on Wednesday, aided by demand for mobile phones and computers in its key markets. The Apple and Samsung gadgets distributor's consolidated net profit climbed to 3.26 billion rupees ($39.06 million) for the fourth quarter ended March 31, according to a regulatory filing. Affluent Indians are increasingly spending more than 30,000 rupees ($361.30) on new smartphones, benefiting manufacturers and distributors such as Redington. Global personal computer sales also show signs of recovery after inflation-hit customers delayed system upgrades for several quarters. Revenue from operations for Redington rose nearly 3% to 224.33 billion rupees, benefiting from an 8% growth in its SISA segment, which includes Singapore, India and South Asia. Revenue from its consumer and commercial personal computers, print and supplies business in SISA rose 10% in the quarter, while its smartphones and feature phones business in the region recorded a 6% growth. The growth in SISA made up a 2% decline in revenue from the rest of the world for the company, which has a presence in 31 countries, including Rwanda, Oman and Turkey.

iPad Pro M4 review: ludicrously good hardware that’s total overkill for most,15/5/2024 6:00,Samuel Gibbs Consumer technology editor14 May 2024 at 11:00 pm·7-min read,"Apple’s latest iPad Pro is thinner and lighter, and has a stupendous new OLED screen, plus oodles of power to do practically anything. But it is no longer just the super-premium iPad – it is also aiming to be an impressive tool for the creative industry. It still looks and acts like an iPad, ready to do regular iPad things such as browse the web, watch TV or chat to your family on the other side of the country. But to do only that with a machine this advanced is total overkill – Apple has many other iPad models suited to that sort of thing. This serious tablet comes with a serious price tag. The smaller 11in version starts at £999 (€1,119/$999/A$1,699), while the 13in model costs from £1,299 (€1,549/$1,299/A$2,199). That’s already laptop money without including accessories such as a keyboard or stylus. Unlike previous generations of the iPad Pro, the 11in and 13in have the same new screen technology, making the smaller model as reviewed more tempting. It essentially has two OLED screens layered on top of each other to produce an extremely high full-screen brightness of up to 1,000nits, and a peak of 1,600nits in super-bright spots in HDR content. For reference, other iPads top out at 600nits, while many competitor tablets, laptops or monitors barely reach 400nits. It runs at up to 120Hz, making it super-smooth in operation, and has incredible contrast similar to high-end OLED displays on phones or TVs. Blacks are truly black, whites are super-bright, and it is spectacularly colourful and accurate. It surpasses the already excellent previous generation, and will be the best screen in almost everyone’s house. For those likely to need absolute colour accuracy, such as those in the film industry, Apple also offers a special reference mode in settings, and sells an antiglare nano texture screen coating, similar to its professional monitors. The tablet is extremely thin at 5.3mm thick or less, and is now lighter by up to 103g depending on the model. You will need a case to keep it safe, and you will need to be more careful with it than you might a cheaper, bulkier tablet. The Face ID selfie camera is now in the right place for video calls in landscape, which is much better.

Huawei flagship store surge in China signals showdown with Apple,15/5/2024 1:02,Josh Ye14 May 2024 at 6:02 pm·4-min read,"By Josh Ye HONG KONG (Reuters) - Huawei is revamping its retail strategy and aggressively opening flagship stores in China, with some just a stone's throw away from Apple shops, as it seeks to retake the premium electronics throne in the world's biggest smartphone market. Situated directly across from Apple's Shanghai flagship store, Huawei's recently renovated shop spans three floors of a famous heritage architecture building in the financial hub's busy shopping district and includes a coffee shop and a gym. Huawei opened four such stores in major Chinese cities between December and February, an aggressive marketing blitz by a company that had largely relied on licensed distributors and is rebounding from U.S. sanctions imposed in 2019 that had crippled its smartphone business for four years until it could source domestic replacement parts. ""The Huawei flagship store is very nice.

It marks a stark contrast to 2021 when the company's licensed stores were shuttered across China due to product shortages caused by the U.S. sanctions. Huawei has since developed its own chips, introduced highly popular 5G-capable products and, according to sources, has started aggressively recruiting dealers in recent months.

OpenAI’s new GPT-4o model offers promise of improved smartphone assistants,14/5/2024 18:00,Alex Hern UK technology editor14 May 2024 at 11:00 am·3-min read,"In the year and a half since the launch of ChatGPT, one nagging question has only got more pressing: if AI can do this, why is my phone’s assistant still so bad? On Monday, the gulf grew larger still, as OpenAI announced a new model called GPT-4o – the ‘o’ stands for Omni – which gives the chatbot new abilities to understand and create audio, video, and still images. The system is uncanny to behold. It can engage in prolonged conversations about the world seen through a camera lens, carry out live translation between two different languages, and even laugh at appropriate points. The shine will inevitably wear off after users find the shortcomings in the system, but its creators are more confident than ever. When GPT-4 was launched in 2023, the OpenAI founder, Sam Altman, tweeted that the AI “is still flawed, still limited, and it still seems more impressive on first use than it does after you spend more time with it”. A year on, there was no such doubt with the launch of its successor: as well as a longer statement about an “an exciting future where we are able to use computers to do much more than ever before”, Altman tweeted a single word: “her”, the name of the 2013 Spike Jonze film depicting a man slowly falling in love with his AI assistant. GPT-4o is closer than ever to that science fiction scenario. Previous versions of the AI have been able to talk to the user, but only through a laborious process of transcribing speech to text, running it through the normal ChatGPT system, then generating human-sounding speech in reply. By contrast, the new system can operate directly in speech without needing to lean on other models to prop it up, speeding up responses and allowing it to acknowledge quirks such as tone of voice. But it still isn’t quite an AI assistant. It can answer questions and perform knowledge work, but not – yet – act on requests. The GPT Store, a repository of third-party integrations collated by OpenAI, could help, but to really embed itself in normal people’s lives, GPT needs the power of Siri. And it seems Apple agrees. The iPhone maker has reportedly been in talks since March with AI developers, including Google and OpenAI, over licensing their technology to improve its own AI assistant. Over the weekend it reportedly “neared” a deal with the latter. According to Bloomberg, which broke the news, the deal would allow Apple to offer ChatGPT alongside the other AI features it will announce at its annual Worldwide Developers conference in June. The link-up would probably fall short of fully replacing Siri with ChatGPT. That is partly because Apple is wary of embedding another company’s technology too deeply in its own devices – the scars from the painful replacement of Google Maps with Apple Maps over a decade ago still smart – but also because even the best AI systems aren’t quite ready for the sort of demands an assistant requires.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/openai-gpt-4o-model-offers-180000533.html,AAPL
"Google debuts a slew of generative AI features as fight with rivals OpenAI, Microsoft, and Apple heats up",14/5/2024 17:56,Daniel Howley·Technology Editor14 May 2024 at 10:56 am·4-min read,"Google (GOOG, GOOGL) unveiled a slew of generative AI products at its Google I/O developer conference on Tuesday, including its Gemini Live assistant, updates for its Android and Workspaces platforms, and an overhaul of its flagship Search product. The announcements are part of Google’s broader effort to reestablish itself as Silicon Valley’s AI leader after it was caught off guard by Microsoft’s (MSFT) partnership with OpenAI in 2022. The new products also come a day after OpenAI unveiled its GPT-4o AI model and days before rivals Microsoft and Apple (AAPL) debut their own major generative AI updates. The biggest announcement is that Google is updating its Search platform to include generative AI results at the top of the screen. The feature, which was originally available as part of a preview in the company's Search Labs, is now coming to all US users and rolling out globally in the coming future. Another one of the biggest announcements was a new, personalized AI assistant called Gemini Live. The feature, powered by the company’s Gemini 1.5 Pro model, will allow you to speak directly to the assistant on your mobile device, providing you with responses in a number of natural-sounding voices. On the Android front, Google says it's expanding the assistant to interact with apps like Google Messages and Gmail, allowing users, for example, to drag and drop generated images from Gemini into texts and emails. Users can also use the app to ask specific questions about YouTube videos, and it will scour the video's captions to find an answer. Google is also updating its on-device version of Gemini, called Gemini Nano, with new multimodal features. Multimodal means that a generative AI model can work across mediums including text, images, and video. Google’s vice president of engineering for Gemini experiences, Amar Subramanya, told Yahoo Finance he’s been using Gemini Live for brainstorming, bouncing ideas off of the assistant. Subramanya said early testers have also been using Gemini Live for scenarios including translation. In the coming months, Google says Gemini Live will be able to access a user's cameras, allowing the assistant to interact with the real world and things it sees. OpenAI has also shown off these capabilities in demos of its GPT-4o. In one example, Subramanya said he asked the assistant to find a recipe for a pineapple upside-down cake for 15 people and add the ingredients to his Keep shopping list. The assistant found a recipe for eight people, scaled the proportions from eight to 15 people, and put the items Subramanya needed to put it together into his shopping list.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/google-debuts-a-slew-of-generative-ai-features-as-fight-with-rivals-openai-microsoft-and-apple-heats-up-175635303.html,AAPL
4 Best ETF Areas of Last Week,14/5/2024 17:00,Sanghamitra Saha14 May 2024 at 10:00 am·3-min read,"Wall Street was upbeat last week with the S&P 500 adding 1.9%, the Dow Jones advancing 2.2% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.1%. Most importantly, the Dow Jones just had its best week of 2024. On Friday, the Dow secured its eighth consecutive session of gains. While most of the 30 members of the Dow Jones Index have performed well over the last seven days, the Dow rally was mainly driven by Amgen AMGN, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, Apple Inc. (AAPL), Boeing BA and The Goldman Sachs Group GS. As far as the company-specific news are concerned, Apple drew attention. The company unveiled a new lineup of iPads for the first time in two years. The tech giant launched two new versions of its top-end iPad Pro models and two new versions of its mid-tier iPad Air. It also debuted the Apple Pencil Pro stylus and an updated Magic Keyboard case for the iPad Pro line. Among US economic data points, we received a downbeat consumer sentiment data. Sentiment dropped to a six-month low. The University of Michigan Survey of Consumers sentiment index for May posted an initial reading of 67.4 for the month, down from 77.2 in April and well below the Dow Jones consensus call for 76. Fed officials reaffirmed the stance for higher rates for a longer period. Policymaker Neel Kashkari signaled that rates are likely to stay at historic highs for a while. Boston Fed President Susan Collins further supported this notion, saying it will take longer ""than previously thought"" to bring inflation down (read: ETFs to Bet on Dow Jones' Longest Winning Streak of 2024).

OpenAI’s leap forward in human-like AI assistants underscores Apple’s growing peril,14/5/2024 15:02,David Meyer14 May 2024 at 8:02 am·4-min read,"Sam Altman promised ahead of OpenAI’s big announcement yesterday that the company would be revealing something that “feels like magic to me.” While I can’t speak for Altman in terms of what he perceives as magical, the new GPT-4o model certainly is impressive. I’ll leave it to my AI-specialist colleagues to analyze what’s going on under the hood, but for the general public, GPT-4o seems set to be the first model that really comes across like a human in out-loud conversation. The persona OpenAI showed off in its demos was perhaps cloyingly over-familiar—creepy, even—but it’s a darn good simulacrum of a person, partly because it can handle text, vision, and audio all at once and at speed. This is where virtual assistants get real—or at least realistic enough to start being justifiably lumped in with the likes of Samantha, the assistant voiced by Scarlett Johansson in Spike Jonze’s 2013 film Her. Altman himself made the comparison in an X post after the announcement. Sure, Samantha may have [SPOILER ALERT] abandoned the film’s lovelorn protagonist at the end of that story, but who cares? This is about the technical achievement, right? Only it isn’t. We have now crossed into the territory of potential seduction, and I don’t mean that in a romantic sense. A realistic text conversation with an AI is impressive and in some cases useful, but a realistic voice, paired with the ability to perceive the user’s appearance and environment, is something else. This is technology that will be able to convincingly influence and cajole the user, and its arrival means we will have to pay very close attention to the compulsions of the entity behind the voice. As I have previously written, I would very much like to see virtual assistants that really work for us—reliable and discreet agents that can do stuff on our behalf, acting only in our interests. They would ideally be open-source, so we could verify their security and privacy promises, but they would also need to be on-device assistants that do not need the cloud to function. Let’s see what Google announces later today at its I/O developer conference—an AI-powered mobile assistant called Pixie is rumored to be on the list—but, as things stand, the most likely company to realize the sort of assistant I’ve been dreaming of is Apple. At next month’s WWDC developer event, Apple will be showing off its own AI advances, which according to the New York Times will include an “improved Siri [that Apple will pitch as being] more private than rival A.I. services because it will process requests on iPhones rather than remotely in data centers.” That sounds like a lot of what I’ve been waiting for, minus the open-source part. However, it remains to be seen to what degree, and in what way, Apple will meet the moment. Apple is behind in the AI game, to the extent that its desire to catch up reportedly played a big role in its decision to abandon its self-driving car efforts. Making Siri smarter will, given Siri’s current dumb-as-a-rock-ness, not be overly difficult. But Apple’s new assistant won’t just have to excel within the paradigm of Apple’s existing offerings—it will need to provide an impressive alternative to the latest and greatest virtual assistants, and OpenAI just set the bar very high indeed. Now, Apple is reportedly in intense talks to have OpenAI’s technology power some of the iPhone’s incoming chatbot features. (Google’s Gemini is apparently still another option.) If these talks bear fruit, it’s as yet unclear whether we’ll be looking at Siri plus another chatbot, or a Siri that uses Apple’s on-device model to deal with certain private stuff, and an external model to handle other tasks—I’m really not sure how that would work.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/openai-leap-forward-human-ai-150259365.html,AAPL

Comcast (CMCSA) CEO Brian Roberts said early Tuesday that later this month, the company will launch a new offering that combines its Peacock platform, Netflix (NFLX), and Apple TV+ (AAPL). The new bundle, referred to as StreamSaver, will be available to customers of Comcast’s broadband internet service, the executive revealed at a MoffettNathanson conference. ""Those three products will come at a vastly reduced price to anything in the market today and be available to all our customers,"" Roberts said. Exact pricing details will be announced at a later date. ""We've been bundling video successfully and creatively for 60 years,"" he added. ""This is the latest iteration of that, and I think this will be a pretty compelling package."" The developments come as media companies face pressure from investors to scale their streaming services and achieve profitability. At the same time, the companies are dealing with more competition from tech giants like Amazon (AMZN) and YouTube (GOOGL, GOOG), which are gobbling up streaming deals. On average, US consumers subscribe to four streaming services and spend about $61 per month on them, according to the latest Digital Media Trends report from Deloitte. That means fewer opportunities for streamers to retain loyal subscribers over time. The concept of bundling isn't new. Companies in the space have been doing it with their own services for years. Apple, for instance, offers Apple One, which combines Apple TV+ with other services like Apple Music and Apple Arcade. The bundle launched globally in late 2020. Disney, which has also been offering a bundle with Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+, officially began its domestic rollout of a one-app experience late last year that incorporates Hulu content via Disney+ — a similar play to Paramount's Showtime combination as well as the integration of HBO Max and Discovery+, which both merged their respective services last year. The move toward partnerships among competing media companies, though, has gained traction recently. Just last week, Warner Bros.

For decades, Western companies made a fortune betting on the inexorable rise of the Chinese consumer. Now an economic slump and the emergence of ferocious local competitors means those bets look less safe as price wars erupt. Discounts and special deals are being offered across consumer brands from food and clothing to consumer electronics and cars, reflecting a dramatic shift in consumption patterns in the world’s second largest economy. One of the most intense price wars is raging in the electric vehicle (EV) industry, where a “life and death” race has manufacturers scrambling for survival. Tesla’s China market share shrank to 4% in April, almost halving from 7.7% in March, according to data released by the China Passenger Car Association on Friday. Deliveries from its Shanghai factory, its largest globally, fell 18% last month from a year earlier. The sharp drop contrasts with rising sales by its biggest Chinese rival BYD, which reported a 29% jump in pure EV deliveries. “Everyone has changed the way they think about China,” said Anne Stevenson-Yang, co-founder and managing principal at J Capital Research. “The business climate has changed entirely.” Last month, Tesla (TSLA) announced aggressive price cuts in the country, shortly after also reducing prices in the United States and Germany.

RBC stressed that AI remains a key growth driver for Microsoft, highlighting that the tech giant continues to make substantial investments in this rapidly developing sector. “While CapEx will likely continue to ramp and impact margins, Microsoft is following demand signals and is simultaneously focused on bringing the cost curve down,” analysts said in the note. “Advances like GPT-4o, which is more efficient, and Maia (custom AI silicon) will help drive down the cost curve,” they added. RBC also emphasized Microsoft's expertise in cloud services as a major advantage, providing a unified architecture for all AI workloads. Moreover, RBC noted that while Microsoft's core cloud business is still in its early stages, there is a clear trend of companies moving more workloads to the cloud. Azure's growth, excluding AI, has accelerated in the fiscal Q2, they noted. “Importantly, core Azure is benefiting from the broader AI roadmap, as one-third of the 50K+ Azure AI customers are net new to Azure,” analysts noted.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/5-big-analyst-ai-moves-033937607.html,AMD

Azure’s cloud service could integrate AMD’s MI300X AI chips to beat Nvidia Corp’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) H100 GPU supply crisis. Recent reports indicated that AMD is winning market share in the x86 processor market for client and server categories despite rivalry from Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC). AMD grabbed Wall Street’s attention for its considerable gains in the server CPU market and the merchant accelerator sector with the Mi300 series, positioning it as a formidable competitor to Nvidia in the merchant accelerators market. Wall Street analysts highlighted a long-term upside of over $10 billion in revenue synergies from the Xilinx acquisition. Meanwhile, AMD is gearing up to meet the increasing demand for AI computing by leveraging its broad product lineup. CTO Mark Papermaster recently pointed to AMD’s robust suite of compute engines, deep customer relationships across various markets, and open software capabilities.

"Investors Heavily Search Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD): Here is What You Need to Know",17/5/2024 13:00,Zacks Equity Research17 May 2024 at 6:00 am·5-min read,"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock. Shares of this chipmaker have returned +4.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5% change. The Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, to which Advanced Micro belongs, has gained 4.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term? While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making. Earnings Estimate Revisions Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock. We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. For the current quarter, Advanced Micro is expected to post earnings of $0.67 per share, indicating a change of +15.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.4% over the last 30 days. The consensus earnings estimate of $3.42 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +29.1%. This estimate has changed -0.3% over the last 30 days. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.18 indicates a change of +51.3% from what Advanced Micro is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.5%. With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Advanced Micro.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-advanced-micro-130014956.html,AMD

Here's why investors seem to be hesitant to own AMD stock: Mizuho,17/5/2024 10:18,Investing.com17 May 2024 at 3:18 am·2-min read,"Investors are growing increasingly skeptical about owning AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) stock, a Mizuho desk analyst highlighted in a new note. “Why add AMD if I own NVDA and AVGO here that are cheaper and feel much lower risk?” appears to be the key pushback among market participants, the analyst said. The chipmaker’s shares rose to an intraday high of $168 on Thursday, amid a broader surge in the technology sector driven by the recently released softer-than-expected inflation data. It seemed like a short squeeze was affecting much of the tech market, the analyst noted. Notably, AMD’s chipmaking peer Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) Technology was up 6-7% at one point despite the lack of any specific news or events. Meanwhile, AMD remains a significant short position for many East Coast hedge funds, and numerous long-only (LO) investors are steering clear of it ahead of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s Blackwell launch later this year. “Stock feels like a plane crash survivor on a life raft in middle of a massive ocean just looking for land,” the analyst wrote. “I remain a bull and love the risk reward if you have patience and duration (think 6-9 months). But I get the worry, hesitancy and concerns amongst investors.” Mizuho’s expert also said that AMD “could be the next Dell (NYSE:DELL),” another major hedge fund short that surged on a bullish preview from Morgan Stanley ahead of their earnings at the end of May. Meanwhile, new reports suggest that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) plans to promote AMD's MI300X GPUs for generative AI at their upcoming Build conference. While it’s known that Microsoft uses AMD's MI300 GPUs to balance Nvidia, recent negative calls in March and April implied that Microsoft was cutting orders to shift funds to Nvidia’s Blackwell GPUs, set for release later this year. “I would watch AMD today, and while this MSFT news itself is unlikely some major catalyst, any focus by MSFT on AMD’s MI300 next week to me feels like a positive catalyst as the cons view is MSFT will cut MI300 orders this yr and AMD will miss MI300 rev bogeys of $9-10B next yr,” the analyst concluded.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-investors-seem-hesitant-101833984.html,AMD

"Is Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) Potentially Undervalued?",15/5/2024 11:00,editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St)15 May 2024 at 4:00 am·3-min read,"Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD). The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NASDAQGS over the last few months, increasing to US$211 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$144. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Advanced Micro Devices' current trading price of US$153 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Advanced Micro Devices’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.  See our latest analysis for Advanced Micro Devices  According to our valuation model, the stock is currently overvalued by about 35%, trading at US$153 compared to our intrinsic value of $113.54. Not the best news for investors looking to buy! If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Given that Advanced Micro Devices’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility. Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Advanced Micro Devices' earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value. Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in AMD’s positive outlook, with shares trading above its fair value. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe AMD should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed. Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on AMD for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there’s no upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for AMD, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.

AMD Failed To Meet Lofty Expectations,13/5/2024 18:09,Upwallstreet13 May 2024 at 11:09 am·3-min read,"At the end of April, Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ: AMD) failed to impress, unlike Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) that has been crushing investor expectations on the back of soaring AI chip sales for quite a while. It’s no secret that AMD trails the undoubtable leader Nvidia that holds as much as 80% of the thriving market for AI server semiconductors. For the March quarter, AMD reported revenue rose 2% YoY to $5.47 billion that slightly surpassed LSEG’s estimate of $5.46 billion. Unlike last year’s comparable quarter when it made a net loss of $139 million, or 9 cents per share, AMD reported a net income of $123 million, or 7 cents per share. Adjusted earnings amounted to 62 cents per share, slightly surpassing 61 cents a share analysts expected. Data center revenue jumped 80% to $2.3 billion thanks to AMD's MI300 series of AI processors that challenge Nvidia and its graphics processing units. CEO Lisa Su revealed that AMD’s MI300X is being used by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), and Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL). Since the launch which took place during 2023’s fourth quarter, AMD sold over $1 billion worth of chips. But it was not enough to offset weakness in the traditional server market. Moreover, AMD’s results were also hurt by gaming revenue that tanked as much as 48% to $922 million. AMD already guided significant double-digit percentage declines in this segment due to revenue from the chips it designs for gaming consoles such as Xbox from Microsoft Corporation and PlayStation 5 from Sony Group Corporation (NYSE: SONY) already hitting their peak. This year marks the fifth year since the most recent generation of gaming consoles has been released and AMD's videogame console revenue peaks after roughly four years.Moreover, a report from research firm Newzoo that was published in April revealed that gamers are clocking in less hours. Newzoo expects personal computing and console gaming revenue growth to continue lagging pre-pandemic levels through 2026. Year to date, industry giants like Sony and Electronic Arts have laid off hundreds of employees. Sony Group is scheduled to report its fiscal fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday. All eyes will be on the profitability of the gaming division as PlayStation 5 promotions ate into profits during the third quarter. When it reported its third fiscal quarter results, Sony lowered projections of PlayStation 5 sales and gaming revenue for the rest of the fiscal 2023. Revenue from the embedded segment that consists of networking chips also plummeted 46% to $846 million, with demand for the segment already expected to remain soft throughout the first half of the year. Revenue was additionally hit from ongoing inventory corrections from this segment as clients clear out a build-up of chips. For the full year, AMD expects AI chip sales of about $4 billion, raising its prior estimate by $500 million. As for the second quarter, AMD guided revenue of about $5.70 billion, plus or minus $300 million which is in line with LSEG’s average estimate. On an adjusted basis, AMD guided for second quarter’s gross margin of about 53%, hardly beating the estimate of 52.9%.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/amd-failed-meet-lofty-expectations-180909619.html,AMD
"Should Weakness in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMD) Stock Be Seen As A Sign That Market Will Correct The Share Price Given Decent Financials?",11/5/2024 11:00,editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St)11 May 2024 at 4:00 am·3-min read,"With its stock down 12% over the past three months, it is easy to disregard Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). However, the company's fundamentals look pretty decent, and long-term financials are usually aligned with future market price movements. In this article, we decided to focus on Advanced Micro Devices'  ROE. Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.  See our latest analysis for Advanced Micro Devices  The formula for ROE is: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Advanced Micro Devices is: 2.0% = US$1.1b ÷ US$56b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024). The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.02 in profit. So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features. It is hard to argue that Advanced Micro Devices' ROE is much good in and of itself. Not just that, even compared to the industry average of 15%, the company's ROE is entirely unremarkable. Although, we can see that Advanced Micro Devices saw a modest net income growth of 7.8% over the past five years. We believe that there might be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/weakness-advanced-micro-devices-inc-110014652.html,AMD
"With Apple entering the fight, the AI chip wars have gone nuclear",10/5/2024 15:05,Daniel Howley·Technology Editor10 May 2024 at 8:05 am·4-min read,"The artificial intelligence (AI) chip wars have officially kicked into high gear. On Tuesday, Apple (AAPL) unveiled its latest iPad Pro lineup, complete with the company’s all-new M4 chip. The processor, Apple says, features a 50% faster CPU than the prior generation Pro’s M2 chip, as well as a GPU with four times the performance of its predecessor. But Apple focused most on the M4’s neural engine, the portion of the chip dedicated to running AI applications. According to the company, the neural engine in the M4 is the company’s fastest yet, and it's more powerful than any neural processing unit available on today’s AI PCs. That might all seem like Apple puffing out its chest at the competition, and it is to a degree. But it also shows we’re entering a new era of PC marketing focused on the promise of generative AI applications running directly on our machines, rather than in the cloud. Microsoft (MSFT) is already pushing the category of AI PCs along with Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), Qualcomm (QCOM), and Nvidia (NVDA), and with Apple entering the fray, the battle over which company is the new AI champ has officially begun. The AI PC, or in the case of Apple AI iPad or AI Mac, is meant to be able to run smaller versions of the kinds of large language models that power apps like ChatGPT, Microsoft’s Copilot, and Google’s Gemini. In fact, Google (GOOG, GOOGL) already runs a version of its Gemini model called Gemini Nano on its Pixel smartphones. AI PCs are, generally, PCs that include neural processing units (NPUs), or in Apple’s case, a neural engine. These are essentially portions of a chip dedicated to powering AI applications. Intel’s Core Ultra chips, which it debuted in December, feature their own NPUs, while AMD has been showing off chips with its XDNA AI engine since May 2023. Qualcomm, for its part, has also joined the fight with its Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus chips. All of these chips should end up in Windows PCs on store shelves by the end of the year. Microsoft is already banking on AI PCs being a runaway success, going so far as to introduce a Windows keyboard button dedicated to its AI-powered Copilot software. It’s the first new keyboard button in nearly 30 years. Apple, on the other hand, has been building its neural engine into its chips since it launched its A11 processor in the iPhone X in 2017. The company has regularly touted its neural engine’s capabilities throughout the years, but the debut of the M4 chip marked the first time Apple started throwing out key performance metrics. During its press event unveiling the M4, Apple was sure to point out that it not only has been outfitting its chips with neural processing engines for years but that the M4 is capable of running 38 trillion operations per second (TOPS). TOPS is more or less a measurement of how well a chip can handle AI tasks. Qualcomm, for its part, says that its Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus chips offer 45 TOPS of performance. And according to CNET, Intel and AMD’s chips top out at 34 and 38 TOPS, respectively.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/with-apple-entering-the-fight-the-ai-chip-wars-have-gone-nuclear-150546931.html,AMD
Is AMD Stealing the Spotlight in Server and Client Markets? Here's What You Need to Know,10/5/2024 14:15,Anusuya Lahiri10 May 2024 at 7:15 am·2-min read,"Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) increased its market share for client and server categories in the x86 processor market. Despite intense competition in the market, particularly between AMD and Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC), AMD continued to grow. Intel, however, made gains in the Internet of Things (IoT) sector. Excluding IoT and semi-custom products such as game console chips that AMD manufactures, Venture Beat cites Mercury Research. Also Read: AMD Positions for AI Leadership with Expanded Portfolio, Quadrupled R&D Investment Ahead of Major Computex Announcements The company again recorded gains in both client and server segments quarterly and yearly. Dean McCarron of Mercury Research noted that x86 processor shipments aligned with typical seasonal trends in the first quarter, ending March 31, with all segments seeing moderate declines, which is typical for this time of year. This past quarter marked the first normal market results across desktop, mobile, and server segments since early 2020 when the COVID pandemic began. However, IoT/SoC processor shipments fell significantly due to decreased console demand, impacting AMD’s SoC shipments. AMD reported a 48% drop in gaming revenue in the first quarter compared to the previous year and anticipated further declines throughout 2024. McCarron explained that the statistics and share movements from the past few quarters better reflect how suppliers managed their inventory corrections. Most comparisons should be valid by the third quarter of 2024, although the year-on-year results are not. For the all-inclusive share, which includes PC client CPUs, servers, IoT, and semi-custom products like gaming consoles, Intel gained 2.4 percentage points over the quarter, driven by AMD’s reduced SoC business. Analysts flagged AMD’s significant gains in the server CPU market and its successful market share capture in the merchant accelerator sector with the Mi300 series, making it a formidable competitor to Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the merchant accelerators market. They also flagged the untapped potential of revenue synergies from the acquisition of Xilinx, suggesting a long-term upside of over $10 billion.

On May 8, Stuart Kaiser, Citi's Head of Equity Trading Strategy, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance where he discussed the role of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in shaping the market for artificial intelligence. Kaiser suggests that the company's earnings report may be the biggest event to look forward to right now, especially for equity holders, according to the S&P 500 index. He also highlighted that if the 10-year rate was pinned at 4.75%, equities would not be largely impacted if NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) misses earnings on May 22nd. The interviewer then directs the conversation to discuss the volatility of the stock. The stock went down to $735 and $740 a couple of weeks ago, to which Kaiser emphasized how NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) poses a macro risk to the market, keeping in mind that it is priced for a significant swing of 10%. Companies like Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) went down double digitals, and big tech stocks, now stabilized, also have been down in correlation. To put NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) position into perspective, the company's earnings report and the way big and small tech companies react to it are extremely crucial to the AI space at the moment. The interviewer then questions how megacap tech stocks upheld their leadership position in the market. The interviewer highlights that the NASDAQ 100 hit a high in July last year and mid-January this year, and has been sideways since, relative to the S&P 500 index.

Apple’s iPad event was an AI teaser for its future,9/5/2024 9:22,Daniel Howley·Technology Editor9 May 2024 at 2:22 am·3-min read,"Apple’s (AAPL) artificial intelligence push has begun. On Tuesday, the company unveiled its latest iPad Pros, which pack an all-new M4 processor. The chip provides the Pro with a number of benefits including a faster CPU and updated graphics processing unit. But it was Apple’s focus on the M4’s AI capabilities that stood out the most. Apple has been putting its neural engine into processors since 2017 and has previously talked up how it helps power a number of iPhone, iPad, and Mac features for some time. But the M4 unveiling was different, serving as an appetizer for the AI features the company will present at its WWDC event in June, when Apple is widely expected to debut a slew of generative AI-powered software features for its various devices. Apple pointed to a number of the M4’s AI bona fides during the keynote, with vice president of platform architecture Tim Millet specifically noting that the chip is capable of 34 trillion operations per second, a measurement commonly used when describing a chip’s AI performance. Millet also said that the M4’s neural engine is more powerful than any neural processing unit in any AI PC. That’s a direct shot at Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), and Qualcomm (QCOM), which are preparing to or are already rolling out their own AI PC chips designed to run large language models on Windows laptops and desktops. Outside of the M4’s AI processing fundamentals, Apple was mum on any substantive discussion of AI software updates. Sure, Millet said that the M4 helps the iPad Pro quickly isolate a subject from its background in a 4K video, but the M2-equipped iPad Air can do the same thing, just a bit slower. All the company had to offer was that the M4 would make AI apps and features run faster and more smoothly. The company also didn’t provide information about the M4’s performance while training or running large language models (LLMs), something that Intel, Qualcomm, and AMD regularly point to as indicators of their chips’ strengths. Still, the fact that Apple gave consumers, and Wall Street, an early look at its AI thinking is important. The company is widely viewed as behind the curve when it comes to the generative AI race, and investors are banking heavily on WWDC serving as Apple’s big AI coming-out party. CEO Tim Cook has been steadily mentioning AI more over the past few months and said during the company’s most recent earnings call that the iPhone maker is investing heavily in the technology.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/apples-ipad-event-was-an-ai-teaser-for-its-future-184058075.html,AMD

(NASDAQ:AMD), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 72% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk). Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute. In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Advanced Micro Devices.  View our latest analysis for Advanced Micro Devices  Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index. Advanced Micro Devices already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Advanced Micro Devices, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Advanced Micro Devices. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.8% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.7% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.1% by the third-largest shareholder.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/advanced-micro-devices-inc-nasdaq-110059538.html,AMD

"Here is What to Know Beyond Why Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) is a Trending Stock",6/5/2024 13:00,Zacks Equity Research6 May 2024 at 6:00 am·5-min read,"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future. Shares of this chipmaker have returned -11.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -1.6% change. The Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, to which Advanced Micro belongs, has lost 8.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term? Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision. Earnings Estimate Revisions Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings. Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements. For the current quarter, Advanced Micro is expected to post earnings of $0.66 per share, indicating a change of +13.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -5.8% over the last 30 days. For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.42 points to a change of +29.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.4%. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.17 indicates a change of +51.1% from what Advanced Micro is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.3%. With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Advanced Micro.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-advanced-micro-130016029.html,AMD
11 stocks that mattered most this earnings season,3/5/2024 13:36,Josh Schafer·ReporterUpdated 3 May 2024 at 6:36 am·4-min read,"The S&P 500 (^GSPC) is wrapping up its two busiest weeks of earnings reports this quarter, with more than half of the index reporting results. Companies have largely surprised to the upside, with the index pacing at earnings growth of 5.5% this quarter, per Evercore ISI. Stock reactions have been mixed, though, as the prospect of interest rates remaining high for longer than expected hangs over markets and many companies struggle to impress investors given the market's roaring rally going into the reporting period.  Below we break down some of the key companies that have reported this season. Tesla (TSLA) stock rose more than 10% on the day following its earnings report despite the company missing Wall Street's expectations for both revenue and earnings per share in the prior quarter. Instead of a fundamentals story, CEO Elon Musk caught investor attention with an announcement that the company would accelerate its launch of a low-cost vehicle. Musk also emphasized the company's role in the AI world, highlighting that the company will be a leader in autonomous ridesharing.  Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) stock soared more than 10% after the company announced its first-ever cash dividend of $0.20 per share. The board of directors also approved stock repurchases of up to an additional $70 billion. The company's market cap surpassed $2 trillion following the report. The Facebook parent company had a different earnings reaction than its tech counterparts. The stock fell more than 10% after the midpoint of its current quarter revenue guidance range came in light compared to the Street's expectations. Spending was also a key concern among investors, as Meta (META) said it expects the company's full-year total expenses to come in between $96 billion and $99 billion, up from a range of $94 billion to $99 billion due to higher infrastructure and legal costs.

Lisa? Lisa Su: Thank you, Mitch, and good afternoon to all those listening today. This is an incredibly exciting time for the industry as the widespread deployment of AI is driving demand for significantly more compute across a broad range of markets. Under this backdrop, we are executing very well as we ramp our data center business and enable AI capabilities across our product portfolio. Looking at the first quarter, revenue increased to $5.5 billion. We expanded gross margin by more than 2 percentage points and increased profitability as data center and client segment sales each grew by more than 80% year-over-year. Data center segment revenue grew 80% year-over-year and 2% sequentially to a record $2.3 billion. The substantial year-over-year growth was driven by the strong ramp of AMD Instinct MI300X GPU shipments and a double-digit percentage increase in server CPU sales. We believe we gained server CPU revenue share in the seasonally downed first quarter, led by growth in enterprise adoption and expanded cloud deployments. In cloud, while the overall demand environment remained mixed, hyperscalers continued adopting fourth-gen EPYC processors to power more of their internal workloads and public instances. There are now nearly 900 AMD-powered public instances available globally, as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google all increase their fourth-gen EPYC processor offerings with new instances and regional deployments. In the enterprise we have seen signs of improving demand as CIOs need to add more general purpose and AI compute capacity, while maintaining the physical footprint and power needs of their current infrastructure. This scenario aligns perfectly with the value proposition of our EPYC processors. Given our high core count and energy efficiency, we can deliver the same amount of compute with 45% fewer servers, compared to the competition, cutting initial CapEx by up to half, and lowering annual OpEx by more than 40%. As a result, enterprise adoption of EPYC CPUs is accelerating, highlighted by deployments with large enterprises, including American Airlines, DBS, Emirates Bank, Shell, and STMicro. We're also building momentum with AMD-powered solutions powering the most popular ERP and database applications. As one example, the latest generation of Oracle Exadata, the leading database solution used by 76 of the Fortune 100 is now powered exclusively by fourth-gen EPYC processors. Looking ahead, we're very excited about our next-gen Turin family of EPYC processors featuring our Gen 5 core. We're widely sampling Turin, and the silicon is looking great. In the cloud, the significant performance and efficiency increases of Turin position us well to capture an even larger share of both first and third-party workloads. In addition, there are 30% more Turin platforms in development from our server partners, compared to fourth-gen EPYC platforms, increasing our enterprise and with new solutions optimized for additional workloads. Turin remains on track to launch later this year. Turning to our broader data center portfolio, we delivered our second straight quarter of record data center GPU revenue as MI300 became the fastest ramping product in AMD history, passing $1 billion in total sales in less than two quarters.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/advanced-micro-devices-inc-nasdaq-195837429.html,AMD
Top 25 Stocks in the S&P 500 by Index Weight Right Now,2/5/2024 16:11,Ramish Cheema2 May 2024 at 9:11 am·9-min read,"In this piece, we will take a look at the top 25 stocks in the S&P 500 by index weight right now. If you want to skip our coverage of the flagship stock index and some recent news for its biggest constituents then you can skip ahead to Top 10 Stocks in the S&P 500 by Index Weight Right Now. The S&P 500 plays a crucial role in the U.S. economy, politics, and the finance industry. This is because it is one of the most widely followed barometer of the economy, with investors and finance professionals using its data to inform their daily decision making. For politicians, a rising index means that they can boast to voters for having managed the economy well. For finance professionals, they can rest easy knowing that the pricey bets that they might have made on the stock market are doing well. When compared to other indexes, the S&P 500, managed by S&P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI), is particularly important because of the stringent conditions that a firm must meet to be included in it. For starters, only sizeable large cap stocks, or those with a market capitalization greater than $18 billion can be included in the index. These large cap stocks must also be highly liquid, generate most of their revenue in America, and of course, be profitable. These criteria remove most firms that might not do well financially, and as a result, the S&P is also recommended as a great passive investment. Shifting to its performance, 2024 has been a fireworks filled year for the S&P 500. The index is up by 6.9% year to date, after it also crossed the illustrious 5,000 point mark for the first time in its history. In fact, year to March 28, 2024 the index had marked 11% in gains, but it ended up losing these after the inflation data for the month led to investors significantly revising their Federal Reserve interest rate cut expectations for 2024. In April, while the index did end up revaluing itself in the wake of shifting rate cut paradigms, the first quarter of 2024 earnings season marked by Wall Street's enduring focus on artificial intelligence seems to have injected some life into it. The season, at least as far as artificial intelligence and technology stocks are concerned, started by Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) sharing its latest financial performance on April 24th. Meta's results led to tens of billions of dollars in market value being wiped out as investors didn't take too well to $40 billion in AI spending for 2024 at a time when expenses were growing. These were followed by results from Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), which were more favorably received. If anything, the latest earnings reports have at least stopped the S&P 500 from bleeding further losses, and right now, Wall Street is focused on the Federal Reserve's meeting at the end of April. While this meeting is not expected to yield a rate cut, the focus, as always, is on comments made by the Fed after its meetings. These comments help set the tone for future monetary policy actions, and traders will also focus on earnings from Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) to see whether there's any juice left for more growth. Google parent Alphabet's earnings came with a nice surprise for investors in the form of a dividend, and Wall Street is now focused on whether Amazon will follow suit. However, while the economic picture on the surface might point to fewer Fed interest rate cuts, the S&P 500 might surprise by posting gains if the central bank overshoots market expectations or considers economic weakness more strongly than expected. Just what might force the Fed to swing the other way despite hot inflation and labor costs? Olivia Micklem of Artemis Investment has some insights: Obviously we can see with the data that's been coming through in recent weeks that inflation continues to run hotter than we would have liked to see at this point in the year. That being said, alongside that we are starting to see pockets of weakness in the economy whether that's parts of the consumer economy and other parts of the industrial complex. We got some softer number out of some of the trucking companies last week, for example. So there are indications that some parts of the economy are slowing down. I think we still remain you know cautiously optimistic that there could be an opportunity as we move through the year for the Fed to stay on track with some of their plans to start bringing rates down. So, with the S&P 500's future remaining as dynamic as ever, we decided to look at which stocks have been assigned the highest weights by its managers. A few notable ones are Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Our Methodology",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/top-25-stocks-p-500-161144848.html,AMD

Employers toggle the deployment of AI for their workforce and customers,2/5/2024 14:00,John Kell2 May 2024 at 7:00 am·4-min read,"If a client of TIAA visited the company’s website and typed into the search bar a question about retirement planning, two sets of responses would be given. The first is a general list of responses that TIAA has traditionally offered to clients and the general public.

Initially, this tool was meant to help all TIAA employees understand the financial jargon of retirement financial services. But it was so successful the generative AI tool is now offered publicly, too. “This is where we are now taking it—from what was a truly internal use case to educate our folks on this complex set of knowledge management—and starting to put that in the hands of our prospects and clients,” says Sastry Durvasula, chief information and client services officer at TIAA. As companies like TIAA explore dozens of use cases for generative AI, one pattern that has emerged is a spillover of the projects companies were initially deploying to help workers, now finding their way into external uses. Since Durvasula joined TIAA a little over two years ago, he’s helped the company set up an incubation arm that gives clients the ability to initially test AI use cases internally. “I would say there’s a large portion of our use cases that start internal and graduate into an external realm as well,” says Durvasula. “The best place to start is with your employees,” says Sabry Tozin, VP of productivity engineering at social media platform LinkedIn. Colleagues are more willing than customers to offer feedback about what tech works—or doesn’t work. LinkedIn started to use virtual AI chatbots internally to help with knowledge management, like helping workers learn about benefits the company offers to those having a child. LinkedIn is applying the lessons learned from that AI tool to more helpfully share content with customers. And while LinkedIn says colleagues are considered “customer zero” for the products it develops, that group is also a bit more tolerant when AI makes a mistake. “From that perspective, we’re a little bit more strict on the customer-facing stuff,” says Tozin. Ryan Bulkoski, a partner at executive search and management consulting firm Heidrick & Struggles, says companies need to balance how they tackle both internal and external AI use cases and shouldn’t tilt too far in one direction.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/employers-toggle-deployment-ai-workforce-140000020.html,AMD
AI chip darling AMD struggles to impress Wall Street this earnings season,1/5/2024 20:13,Josh Schafer·ReporterUpdated 1 May 2024 at 1:13 pm·3-min read,"AMD's (AMD) latest round of quarterly results reminded investors that not all chipmakers are going to see Nvidia-like growth amid the artificial intelligence boom. The chipmaker reported it expects current quarter revenue in a range of $5.4 billion to $6 billion, in line with Wall Street's estimates for $5.7 billion. But shares fell nearly 9% on Wednesday, reflecting that in-line reports might not be enough for AI investors after more than a 70% run-up in AMD stock over the past year. Specifically, Wall Street analysts noted that the outlook for AI growth within AMD might not be as robust as some had hoped. In a note cutting his price target to $185 from $195, Bank of America research analyst Vivek Arya wrote that AMD bulls might've been disappointed in the company's forecast for MI300 chips in 2024, which came in at $4 billion. While an increase from the prior guide of $3 billion, Arya noted that it felt short of more optimistic outlooks for a range of $5 billion to $6 billion. This comes in contrast to Nvidia's (NVDA) recent run of AI dominance, where the company has consistently surprised Wall Street's lofty expectations.  ""We believe NVDA's vertical integration across systems/software will remain tough for AMD to beat,"" Arya wrote. Wedbush analyst Matt Bryson reasoned the price reaction in AMD was investors failing to see the ""forest through the trees"" in the AI story. But AMD's move mirrored other drops in chipmaker stocks on Wednesday, pointing to a slowdown in investor enthusiasm around the AI trade, particularly in names that have rallied heavily over the past year. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) shares, which had been up more than 700% over the past year, fell more than 14% on Wednesday after the company reported quarterly revenue of $3.85 billion — short of Wall Street's estimates for $3.95 billion but still reflecting about 200% growth compared the same period a year prior. The company also boosted its full-year revenue guidance to a range of $14.7 billion to $15.1 billion, up from a prior range of $14.3 billion to $14.7 billion.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-chip-darling-amd-struggles-to-impress-wall-street-this-earnings-season-151921644.html,AMD

Top 20 Tech Companies in Silicon Valley,1/5/2024 14:36,Ramish Cheema1 May 2024 at 7:36 am·9-min read,"In this piece, we will take a look at the top 20 technology companies in Silicon Valley. If you want to skip our coverage of the world's technology hub and a region that has changed the world as we know it, then check out 5 Top Tech Companies in Silicon Valley.  If there's one thing that 2024 has made sure it's that Silicon Valley isn't going anywhere. The sector that gave us the microprocessor, the personal computer, the Internet, and the smartphone is now leading the charge with a set of technologies called artificial intelligence. Typically the domain of science fiction, AI is a collection of techniques that fall under the category of data science. It is the most advanced kind of data science there is, as the software is programmed to learn from voluminous data sets to generate and create insights of its own. The close of the first quarter of 2024 also provided Wall Street the ability to take stock of where some of the biggest technology companies in the world, most of which are in Silicon Valley, are when it comes to artificial intelligence. Big ticket technology and AI companies, such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) report their earnings for the first quarter of 2024. These results primarily focused on the costs that the companies had incurred for their AI platforms in Q1 and also their plans for further spending this year. One of the first firms to report its earnings was the Facebook parent Meta. Its shares tanked by 16% in aftermarket hours on the day of the earnings report, as Wall Street digested a multi billion dollar AI capital expenditure plan for 2024 and saw costs grow for the first time after two consecutive quarters. Alphabet sought to assure investors of its stability, as it became yet another technology stock to declare a dividend. An additional source of income is almost always welcomed by investors, and Alphabet's shares soared by more than 10% in aftermarket, even as its peer Microsoft demonstrated mixed share price performance despite being one of the strongest performers on the artificial intelligence front. Delving deeper into Silicon Valley giant Alphabet's earnings, the firm known for being Google's parent, announced a 20 cent dividend and a $70 billion stock buyback. Both of these are great for helping the share price, and since its earnings report, Alphabet's stock is by 6% after shedding some of its 10% gains in post earnings gains during regular trading hours. On the revenue front, Alphabet brought in $80 billion while it raked in $1.81 on the EPS front. Both of these beat analyst estimates that had stood at $78.59 billion and $1.59, and coupled with $61.7 billion in advertising revenue that surged past estimates of $60.2 billion meant that the latest set of results was rather well rounded. On the hardware side of things, Intel, which is one of the biggest semiconductor manufacturers in the world, is currently focusing on the leading edge side of the industry. The firm has lost its chip manufacturing race to the Taiwanese Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), and in April 2024, it announced the 'first light' for the world's most advanced chip making machine, a high NA EUV scanner. First light refers to the first time that a chip making machine is turned on, and the event typically marks the end of countless hours of work spent in setting up the complex machines. As for AI, here's what the management of Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), another Silicon Valley firm, had to say during its Q1 2024 earnings: We’re bringing generative AI to Adobe Experience Cloud and will demonstrate our AI Assistant for Customer Experience Management at Adobe Summit. Every student, communicator, creative professional and marketer is now focused on leveraging generative AI to imagine, ideate, create and deliver content and applications across a plethora of channels. Adobe is uniquely positioned through the combination of Express, Firefly, Creative Cloud, Acrobat and Experience Cloud to deliver on this immense market opportunity. The success we are already seeing with our GenStudio offering in the enterprise is validation of our leadership, and we expect that success to translate into other segments as we roll out these solutions throughout the year. We are driving strong usage, value and demand for our AI solutions across all customer segments. With these details in mind, let's take a look at some top technology companies in Silicon Valley. A couple of notable names are Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).

The company reported EPS of $0.60 on revenue of $5.35 billion in the same quarter last year. Importantly, AMD saw better-than-anticipated Data Center revenue in the quarter, with the company reporting sales of $2.34 billion. Wall Street was looking for $2.31 billion. AMD’s MI300 chips are meant to go head-to-head with Nvidia’s (NVDA) bestselling H100 line of accelerators. The company previously said that its MI300X beats out Nvidia’s chips, a claim Nvidia rejected. Intel is also chasing Nvidia’s H100 platform with its Gaudi 3 accelerators.

UPDATE 1-Chipmaker AMD narrowly beats first-quarter revenue estimates,30/4/2024 20:34,Reuters30 April 2024 at 1:34 pm·1-min read,"(Adds shares in paragraph 2, revenue forecast in paragraph 8, background throughout) April 30 (Reuters) - Advanced Micro Devices beat first-quarter revenue estimates by a small margin on Tuesday as tepid demand for semiconductors used in traditional data centers added to weakness in the market for gaming chips. Shares of the Santa Clara, California-based company fell 3% in extended trading. Enterprises rushing to adopt generative AI have prioritized spending on AI server chips, hitting demand for traditional server semiconductors, which constitute a large portion of AMD's revenue. These processors cannot effectively handle the complex tasks associated with AI. While some of AMD's central processors are used in conjunction with AI chips, the ratio is skewed in favor of the more advanced processors. AMD trails front-runner Nvidia in the booming market for artificial intelligence server semiconductors, where Nvidia commands about 80% of the share. Uncertain demand from the gaming market has further hurt AMD. Personal computing and console gaming revenue growth is expected to remain below pre-pandemic levels through 2026, according to research firm Newzoo. Weakness has also evaded AMD's embedded segment, which caters to markets such as automotive and industrial.

Is Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) a Buy Ahead of Q1 Earnings Announcement?,30/4/2024 15:36,Bryan Hayes30 April 2024 at 8:36 am·1-min read,"Semiconductor giant Advanced Micro Devices AMD is set to report first-quarter earnings results on Tuesday after the close. AMD, a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), has surpassed the earnings mark in each of the last four quarters. But with shares pulling back recently amid sector weakness, is AMD a buy? AMD is expected to post a profit of $0.60/share, which would reflect a flat outcome versus the same quarter last year. Estimates for the quarter have increased 1.69% over the past 60 days. Sales are projected to have risen 1.24% to $5.42 billion. The company has delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 2.96%. The tech powerhouse faces significant hurdles including weakness in its Gaming division. The company also continues to experience significant competition from Nvidia in the GPU market. Another obstacle that was recently announced is China’s growing technological decoupling. China will keep AMD processors out of government PCs and servers moving forward in an effort to buoy domestic technology in the face of U.S.-led restrictions on exports. Earnings reactions can be extremely volatile and are based on a wide variety of factors. Our proprietary Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) calls for another earnings beat for the upcoming announcement.

13 Most Popular Retail Investor Stocks in 2024,29/4/2024 15:50,Ramish Cheema29 April 2024 at 8:50 am·9-min read,"In this piece, we will take a look at the 13 most popular retail investor stocks in 2024. If you want to skip our introduction to how retail trading has changed over these past couple of years and some recent trends, then you can check out 5 Most Popular Retail Investor Stocks in 2024.  The stock market of 2024 is quite different from the one present at the turn of the millennium. This is because the internet and consumer technology have made vast sums of information available to anyone willing to learn. As a result, more people are able to invest in the stock market, and this trend soared during the coronavirus pandemic. While the pandemic is known for the devastating disease and the lock downs, at the same time, it also put retail investors for the first time on Wall Street's map. This happened through the meme stock mania, which saw popular companies GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AMC) soar on the stock market as retail investors joined forces on social media and bought the shares in bulk. The rise of retail investors has also introduced a new angle to investing. Professional investors, like hedge funds, only have one objective in mind when making their decisions. This is profit maximization, whether the shares are bought long, sold short, or held to force a change at the firm as is with activist investing. On the flip side, retail investors, while also naturally influenced by the profit motive, also invest in stocks that they like. For instance, hedge funds had sold GameStop short and negatively influenced its share price because they remained unconvinced about the traditional brick and mortar retailer's ability to compete in the digital new world dominated by virtual video game downloads offered by platforms run by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY). The retail camp, on the other hand, had also invested in GameStop because of their attachment to the brand. 2024 is seeing this bifurcation between retail and professional investors surface once again. One of the hottest, and most volatile, stocks this year has been Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. (NASDAQ:DJT). Like GameStop before it, DJT's investors also have a personal motive for piling into the shares. Retail investors have invested in the stock because they trust the former US President, and have continued to hold the shares even though TMTG battles short sellers. TMTG is a social media company that operates Truth Social, a platform President Trump set up after he was banned from Twitter (now X) and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s Facebook. With the US Presidential race for 2024 having kicked off, investors are also battling it out on Wall Street as TMTG stock rises and falls. DJT - the stock - is quite fresh as it commenced trading just earlier this year. Before the merger between Digital World Acquisition Corp (DWAC) and TMTG, the shares had traded under DWAC and had become a proxy for the former President's daily affairs. Soon after its merger, TMTG shared with investors that it had earned $4 million in income from ads run on its platform. The stock DJT is up 138% year to date, entering the year after TMTG sued press outlets for incorrectly interpreting its financial statements. The fireworks in its share price are also recent, as $DJT's predecessor stock, $DWAC, was flat throughout 2023. Like other special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), DWAC's stock also posted its strongest gains soon after the stock was listed for public trading. Back in October 2021, the stock stunned the market by soaring to $175 and settled to close at $94, the highest in its history. This marked a 1,500% price appreciation in the two trading days after news hit the wires that TMTG was merging with DWAC as the Trump team geared up to launch Truth Social. From its peak close of $94, the shares are down by 55%, after they narrowed the drop to 34% earlier this year after the merger and the ticker change to DJT. With these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the most popular stocks among retail investors. A couple of notable names are Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). michael-fortsch-SIz6izQKxzs-unsplash Our Methodology  To make our list of the most popular stocks among retail investors, we used data from the Robinhood Index, Fintel, and Vanda Research to make a list of all the stocks that ordinary traders can't get enough of. For these popular retail investor stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

"Estimating The Fair Value Of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)",29/4/2024 11:01,editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St)29 April 2024 at 4:01 am·6-min read,"Advanced Micro Devices' estimated fair value is US$161 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Current share price of US$157 suggests Advanced Micro Devices is potentially trading close to its fair value  Analyst price target for AMD is US$197, which is 22% above our fair value estimate How far off is Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine. Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.  Check out our latest analysis for Advanced Micro Devices  We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars: 2024 2025",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/estimating-fair-value-advanced-micro-110147933.html,AMD

Companies reporting earnings include AMD (AMD), Coca-Cola (KO), Eli Lilly (LLY), McDonald's (MCD), Novo Nordisk (NVO), Starbucks (SBUX), and Super Micro Computer (SMCI). The latest decision on interest rate policy from the Federal Open Market Committee is likely on Wednesday, followed by a media press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell.

Intel CEO confident in its AI future after posting soft guidance,26/4/2024 18:27,Brian Sozzi·Executive Editor26 April 2024 at 11:27 am·3-min read,"After several steps forward with investors, it's a few steps back for Intel (INTC). Shares of the chipmaker fell 8% on Friday, following several hiccups in its first quarter results and second quarter guidance. While the company's first quarter earnings managed to surpass forecasts by $0.05, its guidance for the rest of the year came below consensus. ""We have a lot of great things happening in the second half of the year. We feel very comfortable with the outlook we have,"" Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said to Yahoo Finance. The selling pressure on Intel's stock stems from two areas. First, results for the quarter were constrained by a wafer supply issue that Wall Street failed to properly model. And second, there was some demand softness from customers — which is causing Intel execs to be on the cautious side for the second quarter guidance. Intel expects second quarter sales of between $12.5 billion and $13.5 billion. Analysts were anticipating $13.63 billion. Earnings are projected at $0.10 per share, short of analyst forecasts for $0.24.

AMD, initially planning to release the MI350 in the second half of this year and start mass production next year, has moved the release to the second quarter. Trend Force reports that the MI350’s bandwidth has increased by over 30% compared to its predecessor, the MI300.

Is a Surprise Coming for Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) This Earnings Season?,26/4/2024 13:52,Zacks Equity Research26 April 2024 at 6:52 am·2-min read,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report. That is because Advanced Micro Devices is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for AMD in this report. In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 77 cents per share for AMD, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 60 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for AMD, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +28.33% heading into earnings season. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Quote A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here). Given that AMD has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for F5’s second-quarter earnings has been revised upward by a penny to $2.88 per share over the past 30 days and indicates an improvement of 13.8% from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of $2.53. The consensus mark for revenues stands at $686.9 million, which calls for a 2.3% decrease from the year-ago quarter.

With F5 gearing up to report its Q2 earnings, let’s evaluate whether now is the right time to buy this networking giant. F5, Inc. price-eps-surprise | F5, Inc. Quote F5 is one of the major players in the application delivery controller (ADC) market, offering vital products for data center consolidation, virtualization and cloud services. Additionally, F5 has gained significant market share due to Cisco's shift away from the core ADC market. It is also a major developer and provider of software-defined application services, ensuring secure, speedy and accessible applications across IP networks on any device and at any time. F5 stands out to benefit from the booming application networking market. With a strong hold in Layer 4-7 content switching and a solid position in data centers, the company is poised to expand market share, especially given the increasing demand for capacity and security in next-gen applications. The growing demand for cloud-based applications, digital transformation and cybersecurity solutions bodes well for F5's long-term growth prospects. As organizations increasingly rely on application delivery and security services to support their digital initiatives, FFIV stands to benefit from these trends. While F5's financial performance in recent quarters has been mixed, with revenues and earnings fluctuating due to macroeconomic factors and industry dynamics, the company's resilient business model and cost optimization efforts have helped mitigate some of these challenges.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/f5-ffiv-portfolio-ahead-q2-124800398.html,AMD
13 Best Growth Stocks To Invest In For the Next 5 Years,25/4/2024 21:56,Sheryar Siddiq25 April 2024 at 2:56 pm·16-min read,"In this article, we discuss 13 best growth stocks to invest in for the next 5 years. If you want to skip our discussion on the stock market landscape, head over to 5 Best Growth Stocks To Invest In For the Next 5 Years. Despite facing fluctuations and pressures, the U.S. stock market has shown remarkable resilience in 2024. Following a robust performance in 2023, the broad-based S&P 500 index has delivered a 6.91% return thus far in 2024. Although concerns about a potential pullback due to high-interest rates and geopolitical risks have emerged among investors, there are still opportunities for profit in the market. Toward the end of 2023, the Federal Reserve expressed optimism about the US economy, with chairman Jerome Powell highlighting progress toward the Fed's 2% inflation target. A report by Confluence Technologies in January of this year indicated that this rally favored growth and volatility in the equity markets. As reported by CBS News, economists anticipate 2024 to be a year of accelerated growth, reduced inflation, and robust job creation in stark contrast to the recession concerns prevalent in 2023. The National Association for Business Economics (NABE) predicts a 2.2% increase in gross domestic product (GDP) for 2024, a notably more optimistic outlook than their projections from just two months ago. Inflation, which impacts expenses like groceries, rent, and insurance, is also anticipated to further decelerate this year, with NABE forecasting a decline in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to an annual rate of 2.4%, down from 4.1% in 2023 and 8% in 2022. As Q2 commences, investor sentiment towards the stock market has shifted, with expectations leaning towards a resilient economic backdrop. This adjustment comes as recent economic indicators reveal that while inflation has moderated from its 2022 peaks, it remains above the Federal Reserve's desired levels. The market's attention turned to Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) following the company's first-quarter earnings, marking the beginning of the earnings season among the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks that drove much of last year's S&P 500 gains. surged by as much as 8% in after-hours trading following its announcement regarding plans to introduce more affordable models in its future vehicle lineup. Despite falling short of earnings expectations on both revenue and profit, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) exceeded estimates for gross margins, achieving 17.4% compared to the anticipated 16.5%. Given the automaker's significant weighting in the S&P 500 index, its earnings performance is expected to serve as a significant catalyst for the broader market. While hopes for lower interest rates emerged after last year's inflationary pressures eased, recent data indicating persistent inflation concerns has tempered such expectations. Therefore, the welcomed news of a slowdown in overall business activity across the nation on April 23 could provide room for the Federal Reserve to implement the one or two interest rate cuts that many traders are currently anticipating. See Also: 11 Hot Growth Stocks To Buy Right Now. In times ripe for substantial returns, many investors turn to growth stocks as a favored approach. These stocks typically boast higher share prices relative to their earnings per share, reflecting expectations of robust future growth. A key metric often utilized to identify such stocks is the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio), comparing the current share price to earnings per share and indicating the premium investors are willing to pay for a stock's future earnings potential. In the previous year, growth stocks notably outpaced the S&P 500. Bloomberg in January highlighted that the S&P 500 Growth Index surged by 30% in 2023, surpassing the broader benchmark index's gain of 22% for the same period. This performance surprised many investors, especially given the Federal Reserve's consistent rate-hiking stance throughout the year. Over the past few years, certain growth stocks have not only reshaped industries but also left a significant mark on history. A prime illustration of this phenomenon is Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), a semiconductor designer, whose shares have surged by an impressive 443.84% over the last five years on the back of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) and semiconductor chip craze. Furthermore, Brandywine Global highlighted in its Quantitative Review of US Equities for the fourth quarter of 2023 that growth stocks within the Russell 1000 Growth Index substantially outpaced their value counterparts in the Russell 1000 Value Index. By the close of 2023, the growth index boasted returns of 42.7%, whereas the value index significantly trailed with a gain of only 11.5%. In addition, Matt Orton, the chief market strategist at Raymond James Investment Management, advises investors to look beyond concerns about high valuations of U.S. stocks and instead focus on growth opportunities. Here is what he said: “I fully think that the market could push 20, 21 times, and that’s a perfectly fair multiple for us to pay. It’s all about earnings growth and it’s all about leaning into where those fundamentals are, and trying to avoid the parts of the market where you don’t have a positive inflection in earnings. And if you do that, no matter what the valuation is, you can grow into it, and I think that’s the main message for investors, is ‘find growth.’” Among the standout companies on our roster of promising growth stocks to consider are Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), and Uber Technologies, Inc.

Intel reports better than expected Q1 earnings but falls short on revenue outlook. Stock slides more than 5%.,25/4/2024 20:28,Daniel Howley·Technology EditorUpdated 25 April 2024 at 1:28 pm·3-min read,"Intel (INTC) announced its first quarter earnings results after the bell on Thursday, beating analysts' expectations on the top and bottom lines. But the company's Q2 outlook fell short of Wall Street's estimates, sending the stock sliding. Intel said it anticipates Q2 revenue of between $12.5 billion and $13.5 billion. Analysts were anticipating $13.63 billion for the coming quarter. Intel is looking to grow its AI market share by challenging rivals Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) with its new Gaudi 3 AI accelerator while hoping it can woo consumer and enterprise customers with its AI PC lineup. The company reported earnings adjusted per share (EPS) of $0.18 on revenue of $12.72 billion. Wall Street was expecting an EPS of $0.13 and revenue of $12.71 billion, according to consensus data compiled by Bloomberg. Intel reported a loss per share of $0.04 on revenue of $11.7 billion in the same quarter last year. “We are making steady progress against our priorities and delivered a solid quarter,” Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said in a statement. “Strong innovation across our client, edge and data center portfolios drove double-digit revenue growth in Intel Products. Intel is in the midst of transforming itself from a designer and manufacturer of its own chips to a manufacturer of chips for third-party clients. So far, the company said it has six customers, including Microsoft (MSFT), which is developing its own custom chips. The first quarter marks the first time Intel is reporting earnings under its new corporate structure. The company now reports revenue from its Client Computing Group, Data Center and AI, and Network and Edge divisions under its Intel Products segment. Altera, Mobileye, and Other now report under the All Other Segment, while Intel’s Foundry business reports under Intel Foundry. In announcing the restructuring, however, Intel also revealed that its foundry business lost $7 billion in the last year. For the quarter, Intel saw Intel Products revenue of $11.9 billion, up 17% year over year on strong performance from its Client Computing Group. That segment saw revenue of $7.5 billion, up 31% thanks to a rebound in the PC market. Foundry revenue totaled $4.4 billion, down 10% year over year, while All Other revenue came in at $775 million, down 46% year over year. The move to a foundry model puts Intel into direct competition with TSMC (TSM), the world's largest chip manufacturer. But there are doubts that the third-party foundry business will ever be a significant source of revenue.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-earnings-135825817.html,AMD

Revenues are projected to reach $5.42 billion, increasing 1.2% from the same quarter last year. The current level reflects a downward revision of 2.9% in the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter over the past 30 days. This demonstrates how the analysts covering the stock have collectively reappraised their initial projections over this period. Before a company reveals its earnings, it is vital to take into account any changes in earnings projections. These revisions play a pivotal role in predicting the possible reactions of investors toward the stock. Multiple empirical studies have consistently shown a strong association between trends in earnings estimates and the short-term price movements of a stock. While it's common for investors to rely on consensus earnings and revenue estimates for assessing how the business may have performed during the quarter, exploring analysts' forecasts for key metrics can yield valuable insights. That said, let's delve into the average estimates of some Advanced Micro metrics that Wall Street analysts commonly model and monitor. Analysts forecast 'Net revenue- Data Center' to reach $2.28 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +75.9% year over year.

Logitech (LOGI) to Report Q4 Earnings: What's in the Offing?,25/4/2024 12:46,Zacks Equity Research25 April 2024 at 5:46 am·5-min read,"Logitech International LOGI is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Apr 29. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 revenues is pegged at $951.9 million, which indicates a marginal decrease of 0.9% from the year-ago quarter. The consensus mark for non-GAAP earnings stands at 61 cents per share, which suggests a robust increase of 22% from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 50 cents. Earnings estimates for the fourth quarter have remained unchanged in the past 60 days. The company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 39.8%. Let’s see how things have shaped up before the upcoming announcement. Logitech International S.A. price-eps-surprise | Logitech International S.A. Quote Logitech’s fiscal fourth-quarter earnings are likely to have been negatively impacted by the softened demand for personal computers (PCs), the main sales booster for its PC peripheral products. Per the latest International Data Corporation report, worldwide PC shipments improved 1.5% year over year in the first quarter of 2024. However, this growth was largely achieved due to easy year-over-year comparisons as PC shipments declined 28.7% in the year-ago quarter. In 2020 and 2021, Logitech benefited from the elevated demand for its Video Collaboration, PC Webcams, Keyboards & Combos and Pointing Device tools, mainly driven by the heightening of work-from-home and learn-from-home trends. However, the weak global economy amid ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical issues enhanced global recessionary concerns, thereby prompting enterprises to postpone their large IT spending plans. Furthermore, continued industry layoffs due to growing recessionary concerns are hampering the demand for PC peripheral products by organizations. Additionally, a lack of the need for product refreshes is expected to negatively impact the demand for Logitech’s products in the to-be-reported quarter. The majority of the global working population refreshed PCs and related peripheral products about two years ago in the wake of the pandemic-led work-from-home trend. Our estimates for Logitech’s Video Collaboration and Keyboards & Combos fourth-quarter revenues are pegged at $141.2 million and $184 million, respectively. The estimated revenue figures for Video Collaboration and Keyboards & Combos depict a year-over-year decline of 1.9% and 2%, respectively.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/logitech-logi-report-q4-earnings-124600716.html,AMD

12 Best Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2024,24/4/2024 16:16,Ramish Cheema24 April 2024 at 9:16 am·9-min read,"In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 best growth stocks to buy and hold in 2024. If you want to skip our overview of growth stocks and how they relate to the current stock market environment, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2024.  As the first quarter of 2024 is behind us, the stock market is also presenting a changed environment. The first quarter saw an extension of the themes that were in play during Q4 2023. It saw artificial intelligence and technology stocks continue to post gains, as investors were not only convinced that AI held great potential when it came to consumer and business use cases, but also that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates multiple times this year. However, with Q2 now officially underway, investor expectations for a robust economic environment to pile vast sums of money into the stock market have now shifted. Part of this is due to fresh economic data that shows that despite the fact that it is significantly down from the highs of 2022, inflation is still higher than what the Federal Reserve would like to observe. Consequently, major stock indexes such as the S&P 500 and NASDAQ Composite have dialed down some of their gains as Wall Street starts to enter a 'wait and watch' phase. For instance, while the S&P 500 made news in 2024 for crossing the 5,000 point mark for the first time in its history, it ended up losing more than 4% of these gains during the second and third week of April 2024 after the inflation data for March 2024 was released. Similarly, the tech heavy NASDAQ Comp fell by 7% during the same time period and recovered some of these gains later on. How does this relate to growth stocks? Well, the macroeconomic factors that have contributed to the illustrious stock indexes shedding their gains are also ones that do not bode well for growth stocks. One of the most commonly accepted definitions of a growth stock is a firm whose price bakes in a significant premium over the earnings per share. This premium is measured through the price to earnings ratio, which is also evaluated along with the industry average to see whether the high multiple is an industry trend or an exception. Growth stocks are also some of the most highly sought ones on Wall Street since investing for most people is all about making money by watching share prices grow. Some of the best known growth stocks of our times have transformed industries and made history in their respective industries. Two such examples are the semiconductor designer Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and the electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). AMD's shares are up by a whopping 445% over the past five years, showing that those investors with the correct insights about the semiconductor industry who had the foresight to buy the shares in 2019 would be significantly better off now. So why have AMD's shares soared? The answer to this question lies in the nature of the semiconductor industry and the prowess of the firm's CEO Dr. Lisa Su. The nature of the chip sector means that not every company can sell x86 microprocessors. In fact, most such processors are made by the chip behemoth Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), and AMD's success has been due to its ability to capture market share from the larger rival. Tesla, on the other hand, has soared because it became the first company in the world to make and ship electric vehicles on scale. Its share price percentage gain over the past five years is double of AMD's and currently sits at 823%. But is Tesla still a growth stock? Here's what Aristotle Atlantic Partners, LLC had to say about the firm as part of its Q4 2023 investor letter for the Large Cap Growth Strategy fund: Tesla contributed to portfolio performance in the fourth quarter due to our underweight position relative to the growth index. Tesla reported disappointing third quarter earnings in mid-October in part, due to downtime at some factories that were being upgraded. The CEO expressed concern that higher interest rates were impacting demand for automobiles and would not comment on growth expectations for 2024. However, the expected scale production of the Cybertruck is 12 to 18 months in the future which we believe will negatively impact short-term growth. So, which growth stocks might be great picks for 2024? Some top picks are Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and read below for more: A close-up of an investor pointing to a chart featured on a projector, conveying a message of growth.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/12-best-growth-stocks-buy-161638899.html,AMD
Qualcomm is coming for Intel’s biggest market: PCs,24/4/2024 13:00,Daniel Howley·Technology Editor24 April 2024 at 6:00 am·3-min read,"Qualcomm (QCOM) is ramping up its efforts to win the AI PC race and heading for a collision course with Intel (INTC) and AMD (AMD), with the debut of its new Arm-based (ARM) Snapdragon X Plus chip for Windows-based laptops. The company previously announced its more powerful Snapdragon X Elite for Windows laptops in October. The chips, which Qualcomm says will be available sometime in mid-2024, are designed to take on Intel’s latest Core Ultra line of chips as well as Apple’s M3 chip lineup. The X Elite features a 12-core Oryon central processing unit (CPU), onboard Adreno graphics processing unit (GPU), and Qualcomm’s Hexagon neural processing unit (NPU). The X Plus packs a 10-core CPU, a built-in GPU, and a similar Hexagon NPU as the X Elite. The chips can also be outfitted with up to 64GB of memory. Qualcomm is marketing both sets of chips as AI powerhouses, saying that they offer the world’s fastest NPUs for laptops, which allows for better overall performance while running local generative AI applications. In most cases, generative AI apps run on large data center servers that you access via the web. That’s great up until you don’t have an internet connection. The idea behind local AI apps is that you’re able to use them without needing to be online and your data stays on your device rather than on the internet. But so far, there haven’t been too many compelling onboard AI apps to get consumers running out the door to buy AI PCs. Despite that, the industry is banking heavily on the concept to help push sales throughout 2024. Intel, AMD, and Nvidia (NVDA) are marketing some of their high-end laptops as AI PCs. Outside of their AI capabilities, Qualcomm claims the Arm-based X Elite and X Plus lines offer better performance per watt than the Intel Core Ultra 7 155H and AMD Ryzen 9 7940HS chips. The X Elite and X Plus also consume less power than competing Intel and AMD chips, Qualcomm says. Qualcomm is even lining up the X Elite and X Plus against Apple’s Arm-based M3 chips, claiming that the processors are 28% and 10% faster than the iPhone maker’s offerings, respectively. It’s important to note that these kinds of numbers are based on benchmarks, and real-world performance could differ. This is just Qualcomm’s latest dive into the Windows PC market. The company already offers Arm-based chips for Windows systems but hasn't gained much traction in the market. Part of the reason for that had to do with translating apps built for x86 systems that run on Intel and AMD chips to work on Arm-based platforms.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/qualcomm-is-coming-for-intels-biggest-market-pcs-010007040.html,AMD
4 Semiconductor Stocks Likely to Beat Earnings Estimates,24/4/2024 12:37,Anirudha Bhagat24 April 2024 at 5:37 am·4-min read,"The overall earnings for the semiconductor industry this earnings season are expected to be better than the year-ago quarter. After a challenging period marked by economic headwinds and disruptions in the supply chain, semiconductor stocks appear to be on the brink of a significant comeback, fueled by a steady increase in sales. The semiconductor market grappled with challenges arising from pandemic-induced disruptions in the supply chain and the Federal Reserve's stringent monetary policies, which subdued demand and led to a decline in sales. However, with the easing of inflationary pressures and a gradual recovery in demand, the industry has been on an upward trajectory since the second quarter of 2023. The advent of generative AI has further attracted investments. The technology has already proven beneficial across a variety of industries, including marketing, advertising, customer service, education, content creation, healthcare, automotive, energy and utilities and video game development. The growing proliferation of generative AI has boosted the demand for chips, benefiting semiconductor sales. According to the latest data released by the Semiconductor Industry Association, global semiconductor sales grew 16.3% to $46.2 billion in February 2024. This year-over-year growth trend has persisted for four consecutive months, signifying a decent recovery. With the presence of several industry participants, finding the right tech stocks with the potential to beat on earnings can be daunting. However, our proprietary methodology makes this task fairly simple. You could narrow down your choices by looking at stocks that have the perfect combination of two key elements — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for determining stocks that have maximum chances of beating estimates in their next earnings announcement. It is the percentage difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Our research shows that for stocks with this favorable mix of ingredients, the odds of a positive earnings surprise are as high as 70%. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD is scheduled to report first-quarter 2024 results on Apr 30. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has an Earnings ESP of +28.33% at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Advanced Micro Devices’ revenues is pegged at $5.42 million, which indicates a 1.2% increase from the year-ago quarter. The consensus estimate for the bottom line has been revised upward by a penny to 60 cents per share over the past seven days.

13 Best Ethical Companies to Invest in 2024,24/4/2024 8:01,Ramish Cheema24 April 2024 at 1:01 am·11-min read,"In this piece, we will take a look at the 13 best ethical companies to invest in 2024. If you want to skip our overview of ESG stocks, then you can take a look at 5 Best Ethical Companies to Invest in 2024.  The relationship of the corporate sector with the well-being of the general population is always controversial. On one end, firms like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) have transformed people's lives and allowed them to improve their health, stay connected, and shop for countless products affordably. On the other end, some of the most controversial companies in the world are among the most valuable as well. The best examples of these are the oil mega giants such as Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) who are often targeted by environmental activists due to the polluting effects of their products. Balancing both these factors, i.e. the negative externalities that result from the costs of doing business and the benefits to society of private enterprise, is a field called Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG). ESG seeks to invest only in those companies that are aware of the impact that their operations make on the environment and are actively working to mitigate this impact. It is a relatively newer phenomenon, and despite its noble objectives, the trend seems to have run into roadblocks as of late. This is because the stock market of 2024 is quite different from the 'environment' that was in play in 2018, when ESG investing was gaining traction. In 2018, sustainable investing surged to $30 trillion, as investors forced companies to become more climate conscious and favored those that took the initiative. However, in 2018, interest rates weren't as high as they are right now, and inflation had not yet tasted the impacts of loose monetary policies and global supply chain disruptions. In 2024, the stock market and the broader finance industry are still recovering from both of these. While rates are still high and creating constraints for investors to raise capital, inflation is on a downward trend. At the same time, the fallout from the Russian invasion of Ukraine has shown that the global oil industry is still quite crucial to economic well being despite the fact that fossil fuels are also some of the biggest polluters on the planet. Taking a look at recent stats, data from Bloomberg shows that 2023 wasn't a particularly great year for ESG. The ESG market fell to $30.3 trillion in 2023 from $35 trillion at the start of the year, and subsequent data showed that 2023 was the worst year on record for the sector. This data comes from Morningstar Financial and it reveals that during the fourth quarter of 2023, sustainable funds marked their first full year of outflows in a decade. In Q4 alone, a whopping $5 billion went out of these funds, a figure that jumps to $13 billion for the full year. These outflows came on the back of disappointing performance of sustainable equity funds in particular, as Morningstar's data shows that ""32% of sustainable equity funds dropped to the bottom quartile relative to peers."" This also ensured that the fourth quarter marked the fifth consecutive quarter where investors preferred sustainable funds when compared to their traditional counterparts. Before we head to the best ethical companies, it's also important to know why ESG and stocks with a focus on the environment and broader business sustainability tend to have shied away from gains as of late. One of the biggest reasons behind this is high interest rates, which means that earning a profit becomes difficult. Therefore, companies that focus on sustainability have to deal with high business costs and have to fund costly projects, which means that investors find a better bang for their buck elsewhere. On a final note, here's what Madison Investments had to say about its Madison Sustainable Equity Fund's performance during the fourth quarter of 2023: Equity markets finished the year on a strong note with the S&P 500 up 11.7% during the fourth quarter, bringing the full year return to 26.3%. The Madison Sustainable Equity Fund (Class Y) returned 11.9% in the fourth quarter but lagged the S&P 500 for the full year, returning 18.0%. The strength during the fourth quarter can be attributed to the downward shift of the yield curve. Interest rates dropped during the fourth quarter as inflation moderated and the market began to discount an end to Fed rate hikes and even began discounting interest rate cuts in 2024. Rates rose during the third quarter, with the 2-year Treasury rising to 5.05% and the 10-year moving to 4.58%, its highest level since September 2007. Then in the fourth quarter, the 2-year rate fell to 4.35% and the 10-year fell to 3.94%. Both fixed income and equities rallied in the fourth quarter. The economy is still growing, real GDP grew 4.9% in Q3 and is expected to grow 1.2% in Q4, and 1.3% in 2024. Headline inflation is moderating but remains above the desired 2%. Inflation fell to 3.5% in Q3 and is expected to drop to 3.2% in Q4 with expectations for inflation to fall to 2.6% in 2024. Unemployment remains low at 3.7%, and the consumer continues to spend. However, with Covid savings dwindling and credit card balances rising, we anticipate consumer spending will slow in 2024. The market now expects that the Federal Reserve will cut the Fed Funds rate in 2024. Expectations are for the Fed to begin cutting rates in the second quarter. We continue to expect the Fed to keep rates high until inflation moves closer to 2%, which may not happen until 2025.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/13-best-ethical-companies-invest-080124437.html,AMD
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Can the Stock Move Higher?,23/4/2024 14:01,Zacks Equity Research23 April 2024 at 7:01 am·5-min read,"The market expects Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) to deliver flat earnings compared to the year-ago quarter on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates. The earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 30, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower. While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise. Zacks Consensus Estimate This chipmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.60 per share in its upcoming report, which represents no change from the year-ago quarter. Revenues are expected to be $5.42 billion, up 1.2% from the year-ago quarter. Estimate Revisions Trend The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.87% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.

AMD's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $3.44 per share and revenue of $25.2 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +29.81% and +11.1%, respectively. Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Advanced Micro Devices should also be noted by investors. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.

Possible Bearish Signals With Advanced Micro Devices Insiders Disposing Stock,22/4/2024 11:00,editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St)22 April 2024 at 4:00 am·3-min read,"In the last year, many Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period. Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.  See our latest analysis for Advanced Micro Devices  Over the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive VP & GM of Data Center Solutions Business Unit, Forrest Norrod, for US$5.3m worth of shares, at about US$176 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$147). So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels. In the last year Advanced Micro Devices insiders didn't buy any company stock. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below! If you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying. Over the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Advanced Micro Devices. In total, insiders sold US$7.0m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain. For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Advanced Micro Devices insiders own about US$1.3b worth of shares (which is 0.5% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders. Insiders haven't bought Advanced Micro Devices stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company.

11 Hot Growth Stocks To Buy Right Now,21/4/2024 14:49,Sheryar Siddiq21 April 2024 at 7:49 am·10-min read,"In this article, we discuss the 11 hot growth stocks to buy now. If you want to read about some more growth stocks that are active in the market, go directly to the 5 Hot Growth Stocks To Buy Right Now. As 2024 moves forward, the outlook for both the stock and bond markets undergoes regular fluctuations, influenced by various factors such as economic data releases, Federal Reserve communications, and changes in interest rate forecasts. As an example, the Federal Reserve hiked its benchmark interest rate 11 times from March 2022 to July 2023 amid resurgent inflation, reaching its highest level in more than two decades. This uptick in borrowing costs has contributed to alleviating inflationary pressures, with recent data showing consumer prices increasing by only 3.1% from January 2023, marking a decline from the peak of 9.1% in June 2022 and edging closer to the Fed's 2% target. Surprisingly, progress against inflation has been notable without inflicting significant economic hardship, with unemployment remaining below 4% for 24 consecutive months. Moreover, employers have consistently added an average of 244,000 jobs per month over the past year, with December and January seeing over 300,000 new jobs each. This combination of subdued inflation and GDP growth has fostered optimism that perhaps the Fed can achieve a rare ""soft landing."" On the other hand, the current year has an array of growth opportunities spanning different sectors within the capital markets. Leading the forefront is the technology sector, with artificial intelligence (AI) spearheading innovation. Its swift advancements and widespread integration across various industries render it an appealing option for investors pursuing growth and transformative prospects. As an illustration to this point, venture capital investments in generative AI and AI-related startups surged to nearly $50 billion the past year alone, with notable startups such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Inflection commanding substantial portions of these investments. Following suit is the healthcare sector, securing the second spot, as it progresses alongside developments in medical technologies and a growing emphasis on personalized medicine. The increasing demand for GLP-1, a medication class utilized in managing type 2 diabetes (T2D), is a key factor driving this trend. According to research by J.P. Morgan, the GLP-1 category is projected to surpass $100 billion by 2030, with growth attributed equally to its use in treating both diabetes and obesity. When it comes to stock selection for substantial returns in such times, focusing on growth stocks is a popular strategy. Growth stocks are characterized by higher share prices relative to their earnings per share, reflecting expectations of significant future growth. One metric commonly used to identify growth stocks is the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio). This ratio compares the current share price to the earnings per share, indicating the premium that the market is willing to pay for a stock's earnings potential. Some of the notable companies included in our list of hot growth stocks to buy are Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), as well as industry giants like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), among others listed below.

10 Stocks American Politicians are Buying in 2024,21/4/2024 12:39,Fahad Saleem21 April 2024 at 5:39 am·10-min read,"In this article, we will take a detailed look at the 10 Stocks American Politicians are Buying in 2024. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5 Stocks American Politicians are Buying in 2024. American politicians using their insider knowledge and influence to make money off the stock market has piqued the curiosity of researchers and average investors for decades.  Despite huge controversies and calls for an increased scrutiny and a ban on stock trading for politicians, American senators and Congress members continue to trade stocks. A report by Unusual Whales talked in detail about the performance of American politicians' stock picks in 2023. The report said that of the 100 Congress members trading stocks last year, 33% beat the S&P 500. The report also showed that the most popular stocks among American politicians last year from healthcare, financials and technology industries. The portfolios of Democrats performed better than those of Republicans since the latter group was heavy on financials, oil, and commodities. It's not only the mainstream financial publications and news outlets that closely watch American politicians' stock trades. Investing enthusiasts equipped with data analysis skills also take a huge interest in analyzing the benefits of following Congress stock trades over the long term. For example, three years ago, someone on Reddit analyzed data available on a website called Senate Stock Watcher and processed over 9,000 stock trades initiated by the members of US Congress to see how these stocks perform. This Redditor crunched numbers and found returns of stocks for a month, a quarter and since 2019 through the date of their analysis. The idea was to see how Congress stock picks performed in the short term and long term. Results shows that Congress members are long-term investors since their stock picks beat the S&P 500 by about 6%. However, even for short-term time windows, Congress members' stock picks beat the market albeit with narrow margins. While the STOCK act signed into law by former President Barack Obama significantly limited insider trading by Congress members, data shows that US politicians and insiders sprang back into action when the COVID-19 pandemic hit.  A research showed that between February and early April of 2020, 12 senators made 227 stock purchases worth about $98 million, while 37 House members did 1,358 trades worth as much as $60 million. A Wall Street Journal's analysis shows that about 240 officials of health agencies that won federal contracts related to the pandemic had owned shares of biotech and drug companies worth between $9 million to $28 billion. Investors who are interested in tracking American politicians' stock picks and their performance can use Unusual Whales Subversive Republican Trading ETF (BATS:KRUZ) and Unusual Whales Democratic ETF (BATS:NANC). Both ETFs were launched in early 2023. NANC invests in stocks purchased or sold by Democratic members of Congress and their spouses, while KRUZ invests in stocks traded by Republicans. So far in 2024, KRUZ is up 4.14%, while the ETF has returned about 17% in the past one year. Democrats performed well in both these time periods since the NANC ETF gained 6.3% year to date and 27% over the past one year. Methodology For this article we used publicly available datasets analyzing stock trades of American politicians and picked 10 stocks that were bought by American senators and Congress members over the past few weeks. Some top names in the list include Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Devon Energy Corp (NYSE:DVN). With each stock we have also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why do we pay attention to what insiders are doing?  Insider Monkey’s monthly newsletter and portfolio that focuses on activist hedge funds, insider trading and stock picks from hedge fund investor newsletters and conferences returned 199.2% between March 2017 and March 12, 2024 and outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs’ 144.9% gain by more than 54 percentage points.

"Tech earnings season is coming, and AI is top of mind",20/4/2024 16:03,Daniel Howley·Technology EditorUpdated 20 April 2024 at 9:03 am·7-min read,"Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and the rest of their Big Tech cohorts are gearing up for what is expected to be one of the more eventful earnings seasons in some time. Generative AI will no doubt be top of mind as the push to monetize the technology continues and investors look for any indication that those billions of dollars in investments are starting to pay off. “We're forecasting it to be about an 8% growth as a kind of collective growth number for the large-cap technology companies,” said Alex Smith, head of Canalys' channels research department. “In terms of overall growth, Nvidia is going to far outstrip the rest of the market.” But generative AI isn’t the only thing on investors’ minds. Apple’s earnings should prove eventful after the company’s rough start to the year, with the iPhone maker facing everything from antitrust lawsuits to slowing sales in China, one of its most important markets. Meta (META) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), meanwhile, will give Wall Street a sense of how the digital advertising market is performing. Both companies saw sales increase in the prior quarter, but Alphabet fell shy of analysts’ expectations. The search giant will need to flip the script this quarter. Strap in because it’s going to be a wild few weeks. The generative AI explosion is still reverberating across Wall Street as shares of heavy hitters like Nvidia and Microsoft continue to soar. But after a year of hype, companies will need to start showing that the excitement is paying off. “We can be absolutely sure that the first and most important thing that investors are going to be eyeballing is companies kind of taking their AI washing [saying something uses AI even if it doesn’t] and turning it into meaningful contributions to the top and bottom line,” Daniel Newman, CEO of the technology advisory and research firm The Futurum Group, told Yahoo Finance. Shares of Nvidia are up roughly 75% year to date and 225% over the past 12 months, as hyperscalers like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta grab as many of the company’s AI chips as possible. That has sent Nvidia’s revenue through the roof. In Q4, Nvidia reported revenue of $22.1 billion, up from $6.1 billion in the prior year. But the company is going to begin lapping its explosive growth numbers this year, which could put a damper on investor enthusiasm even if it continues to outperform. “You've had these massive blowouts but as soon as you start to lap that first year of massive blowouts, then it's going to be more average growth numbers,” said TECHnalysis Research president Bob O’Donnell.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/tech-earnings-season-is-coming-and-ai-is-top-of-mind-201132120.html,AMD
4 Blue-Chip Stocks in Focus as Dow Hits New Milestone,20/5/2024 13:04,Ritujay Ghosh20 May 2024 at 6:04 am·5-min read,"Wall Street has resumed its rally this month after a brief pause in April as investors appear to be confident after a spate of favorable economic data, raising optimism about a rate cut soon. All the three major indexes hit a fresh all-time high last week, with the Dow leading from the front. The Dow gained 0.3% on Friday to close at 40,003.59, clinching a fresh record high. The index crossed 40,000 for the first time on May 16. The Dow has been on a rally since the beginning of the year. The Dow has registered 19 record closing highs in 2024. Year to date, the blue-chip index has gained 7.9% and has now ended in the green for five consecutive weeks. Positive economic data has been responsible for the Dow’s recent rally. The Labor Department reported earlier this month that inflation eased in April after increasing in the first three months of the year. The consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.3% month over month in April, lower than the consensus estimate of a rise of 0.4%. On a year-over-year basis, CPI rose 3.4%, in line with analysts’ expectations. Core CPI, which excludes the volatile food and energy prices, also rose 0.3% sequentially in April after increasing 0.4% in the first three months of the year. Year over year, CPI rose 3.6% in April, the lowest monthly increase since April 2021. Besides, job additions to the economy slowed in April, indicating that the labor market is finally cooling. Also, U.S. GDP grew a meager 1.6% in the first quarter after rising 3.4% in the final quarter of 2023, suggesting a slowdown. A slowdown in the manufacturing and services sector PMI in April further suggested a slowing economy, fueling the rally. Investors are again optimistic that the Federal Reserve will soon start its planned rate cuts. Last month, the central bank said that it’s unlikely that there will be another interest rate hike. Moreover, the Fed still plans three 25-basis-point rate cuts by the end of 2024. Markets are now pricing in a 73.2% chance that the Fed will cut the benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points in September, according to the CME FedWatch tool.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/4-blue-chip-stocks-focus-130400181.html,AMZN
Amazon CEO Andy Jassy: An ‘embarrassing’ amount of your success in your 20s depends on your attitude,20/5/2024 10:51,Orianna Rosa Royle20 May 2024 at 3:51 am·4-min read,"Gen Z might be on to something when they say having a ""delulu"" mindset—that is, having a perhaps unjustified belief in yourself—is the secret to success. That’s because Amazon’s CEO Andy Jassy just revealed that it’s not a ritzy college degree or being the best networker that will make you stand out at the start of your career—but a positive attitude. “An embarrassing amount of how well you do, particularly in your twenties, has to do with attitude,” Jassy said in an interview with LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky. After giving up on a career in sportscasting and then dabbling in music management, Jassy—who took Amazon’s helm after Jeff Bezos stepped down in 2021—joined the tech giant in 1997 as a marketing manager. The Harvard Business School alumnus went on to launch the cloud computing platform Amazon Web Services with Bezos. By 2020, AWS generated $13.5 billion of Amazon’s $22.9 billion in annual operating income, making him a clear candidate for CEO. Looking back, he told Roslansky that “there's so many things that you can't control in your work life, but you can control your attitude.” “I think people would be surprised how infrequently people have great attitudes,” he said. “I think it makes a big difference.” The reason why Jassy thinks positivity determines success is pretty straight forward: People want to be around positive people. “You pick up advocates and mentors much more quickly,” he added. “People want those people to succeed—and it's very controllable.” But a cheerful disposition alone won’t get you far, Jassy warned—aspirational workers need to follow through on a can do attidude with action. “Do you work hard? Do you do what you said you were going to do?” he asked. It’s easy to assume that once you’ve climbed the ranks, it’s now your turn to impart knowledge onto others. But Jassy warned that your enthusiasm for learning musn’t end in your twenties—or, when you reach management.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-embarrassing-105112893.html,AMZN

AXP, Walmart Inc. WMT, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS and Merck & Co. Inc. MRK. The Dow Jones Industrial Average touched the milestone of 40,000 for the first time on strong corporate earnings and renewed bets for rate cuts. SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF, which tracks the Dow Jones Index, has gained 6.4% so far this year. While most of the stocks in the ETF portfolio have been rising this year, we have highlighted five that have been leading the way higher. These are American Express Co., Walmart Inc., Amazon.com Inc., The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Merck & Co. Inc. The blue-chip index has outperformed in recent months, with the broadening out of the stock market rally beyond the tech sector. Cyclical stocks, banks and small-cap stocks have all shown an upward trend in recent weeks, powering the blue-chip index. Bouts of stronger earnings and stronger guidance from many mega-cap stocks also propelled the index (read: ETFs to Bet on Dow Jones' Longest Winning Streak of 2024). The reconstruction of the blue-chip index is also paying off. Amazon, which joined the index on Feb 26, provided a boost to the index after it reported blockbuster first-quarter 2024 results. The e-commerce giant beat both earnings and revenue estimates driven by growth in its advertising and AI-powered cloud computing units. Inflation in the United States cooled down for the first time in six months, sparking new bets on Fed rate cuts as soon as September. Low rates are favorable for stocks as they reduce the cost of borrowing, often needed to finance the expansion of companies. Lower rates typically reduce the attractiveness of fixed-income investments like bonds, leading investors to seek higher returns in the equity markets. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, around 70% of traders now expect at least one cut by the September meeting, a notable increase from a week ago. SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF is one of the largest and most popular ETFs in the large-cap space, with AUM of $33.3 billion and an average daily volume of 3.7 million shares. It tracks the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index, holding 30 stocks in its basket, with each making up for less than 8.6% share. Financials (23.2%), information technology (18.8%), healthcare (18.5%), consumer discretionary (14.7%) and industrials (13.9%) are the top five sectors (read: ETFs to Make the Most of the Sector Rotation).

"Walmart, Target, Amazon and Nvidia are part of Zacks Earnings Preview",20/5/2024 8:38,Zacks Equity Research20 May 2024 at 1:38 am·7-min read,"Chicago, IL – May 20, 2024 – Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week’s list includes Walmart’s WMT, Target TGT, Amazon AMZN and Nvidia NVDA. Walmart’s beat-and-raise quarterly release should ordinarily provide favorable read-throughs for Target, which is scheduled to report results before the market’s open on Wednesday, May 22nd. But the two companies have different business models, and that makes expectations off target. To start, Walmart has effectively added a technological component to its well-established reputation for value. Walmart’s digital prowess has allowed it to offer a variety of convenient shopping options, allowing it to gain market share, with mostly high-income households finding the company’s service offerings hard to resist. The company’s revenues in the quarter increased +5.8% (in constant currency), with digital sales up +21% from the same period last year. Another major point of distinction between the two retailers is their merchandise mix, with Walmart heavily weighted towards groceries and Target towards discretionary merchandise. Walmart enjoyed mid-single-digit same-store sales growth in the latest quarter, with the aforementioned high-income households attracted to the retailer for its convenient delivery and pick-up options. Walmart’s general merchandise, which can roughly be considered comparable to the bulk of Target’s merchandise mix, continued to show soft results, with same-store sales down in the low single digits in the quarter. Most analysts expect Target to show low single-digit same-store sales declines but also expect some sequential improvement in the trend line Target is expected to bring in $2.05 in EPS on $24.5 billion in revenues, with earnings unchanged from the year-ago period on -3.2% lower revenues. The stock was up big following each of the last two quarterly releases in March and November, as can be seen in the one-year performance chart below relative to Walmart and the Zacks Retail sector. With respect to the Retail sector 2024 Q1 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 23 of the 34 retailers in the S&P 500 index. Regular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, which is unlike the placement of the space in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard & Poor’s standard industry classification. The Zacks Retail sector includes not only Walmart, Target, and other traditional retailers, but also online vendors like Amazon and restaurant players. Total Q1 earnings for these 23 retailers that have reported are up +38.7% from the same period last year on +6.4% higher revenues, with 69.6% beating EPS estimates and 56.5% beating revenue estimates. Walmart beat both EPS and revenue estimates, but Home Depot missed on revenues. Aside from these two ‘conventional’ retailers, the scorecard at this stage primarily reflects the Q1 performance of the digital players and restaurant operators. As the above beats data shows, these companies have struggled to beat EPS and revenue estimates in Q1.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-target-amazon-nvidia-part-083800980.html,AMZN
"AI skills could boost Hong Kong workers’ salaries by up to 28% and accelerate career growth as AI adoption ramps up, new research finds",20/5/2024 4:00,Amazon Web Services19 May 2024 at 9:00 pm·6-min read,"Hiring AI-skilled talent is a priority for 70% of Hong Kong employers but 73% of them struggle to find the AI talent they need, highlighting a looming AI skills gap in the city   HONG KONG SAR - Media OutReach Newswire - 20 May 2024 -  Amazon Web Services (AWS), an Amazon.com company, today released new research showing that when artificial intelligence (AI) is fully harnessed, Hong Kong workers with AI skills and expertise could see salary hikes up to 28%, with workers in information technology (28%), and research and development (27%) enjoying the highest pay bumps, followed by sales and marketing (25%).   To better understand emerging AI usage trends and skill needs in Hong Kong workplaces, AWS commissioned Access Partnership to conduct a regional study, titled ""Accelerating AI Skills: Preparing the Hong Kong Workforce for Jobs of the Future."" Over 1,600 employees and 500 organizations in Hong Kong were surveyed.   On top of significant salary bumps, the research also found that the productivity payoff from AI could be immense for Hong Kong. Surveyed employers believe that AI can boost their organizations' productivity by 40%, while workers believe AI could raise their efficiency by as much as 47%. Both employers and workers expect to see the same top three productivity benefits from using AI: improving workflow and outcomes (72% & 62%), automating repetitive tasks (66% & 60%), and supporting learning (53% & 50%).   The research also found that employers are also placing greater emphasis on soft skills for employees to possess by 2028. The survey results show that employers find soft skills like critical thinking (56%) and creative thinking (52%) more important than technical skills like coding (51%).   Hong Kong organizations go all-in on AI, with the financial services sector being the most optimistic   The speed of AI transformation in Hong Kong is remarkable. A total of 84% of employers surveyed used AI-powered tools across their organization in 2023, and this will increase to 94% of all organizations by 2028. While most employers believe their IT department (90%) will be the biggest beneficiary, they also foresee research and development (85%), and the business operations department (85%) driving significant value from AI.   Generative AI—a type of AI that can create new content and ideas quickly, including conversations, stories, images, videos, music, and more—has captured the attention of the general public in the past year, and this technology is already transforming workplaces in Hong Kong. The research found that 94% of surveyed employers and 91% of surveyed workers expect to use generative AI tools on the job within the next five years, with 62% of employers highlighting automating repetitive tasks as the top benefit, followed by increasing innovation and creativity (60%) and improving outcomes (56%).   ""The rise of generative AI presents an unparalleled opportunity for Hong Kong businesses to drive innovation, enhance productivity, and stay ahead of the curve. However, nurturing an AI-skilled workforce is essential to unlocking the full potential of these technologies. At AWS, we are committed to empowering organizations of all sizes and individuals in Hong Kong with the training, tools, and resources needed to upskill themselves and prepare them for the AI-powered future,"" said Robert Wang, Managing Director, Hong Kong and Taiwan, AWS.   Delving into key industries in Hong Kong, the research shows workers in the financial services sector (71%), which remains one of the city's most important economic pillars and accounts for around one-fourth of the city's GDP, are the most positive about the impact of AI on their careers and organizations, compared to the manufacturing (69%), ICT (65%), and wholesale and retail trade sectors (57%). A total of 91% financial service respondents use AI tools today, and 94% expect to by 2028. Workers in the sector are well-positioned to reap the benefits of AI, with 81% saying they are ""intermediate"" or ""advanced"" in AI fluency.   Bridging Hong Kong's AI skills gap is mission-critical   A total of 80% of Hong Kong workers indicated an interest in developing AI skills to accelerate their careers, and this interest transcends generations and genders. While around seven in ten Gen-Z (71%), Millennials (73%), and Gen-X (70%) workers want to acquire AI skills, close to half (48%) of baby boomers—a demographic usually contemplating retirement—say they would enroll in an AI upskilling course if it was offered. Meanwhile, male (81%) and female (79%) employees indicated interest in advancing their careers by learning AI skills.   However, the research also reveals a looming AI skills gap that must be bridged to ensure the city is well-positioned to unlock the full productivity benefits of AI. Hiring AI-skilled talent is a priority for 70% of employers in Hong Kong, of which 73% find it challenging to find the AI talent they need. Of the surveyed employers, 76% said they lack the knowledge to implement an AI workforce training program. They also lack the financial resources to provide employees with AI training (70%), and time for employees to pursue AI training outside of core work responsibilities (69%). In addition, 65% of employees cited a lack of knowledge of the AI skills training programs available as a top barrier.   Accelerating digital skills training in Hong Kong   AWS has trained over 100,000 individuals in Hong Kong on cloud skills since 2014. But with the rapid adoption of cloud-enabled technologies like AI, more needs to be done to upskill the workforce at scale so organizations can innovate and grow in an AI-dominated future.   In November 2023, AWS launched its ""AI Ready"" talent development program providing free AI skills trainings to equip people with essential AI skills for thriving in the digital economy. ""AI Ready"" is now available in Hong Kong.   The ""AI Ready"" program provides a comprehensive training to help learners understanding how Generative AI is transforming our working model. It covers topics including prompt engineering, model training and deployment, building Generative AI flow, deep dive on storage & compute services, and more. It also offers usage demos of AWS services such as Amazon Bedrock, Amazon Q Business, and Amazon Q Developers. Its new generative AI courses cater to diverse learners, featuring advanced offerings for tech-savvy individuals and foundational courses for executives in non-technical roles. Participants of the program will have access to a wide range of resources supported by AWS, including online courses, hands-on labs, generative AI application demos, and cross-community competitions.

"Dow at 40,000: Why stocks still have 'plenty of room to run'",19/5/2024 15:55,Seana Smith·HostUpdated 19 May 2024 at 8:55 am·4-min read,"Investors are catching the bull by the horns. That’s the sentiment gripping Wall Street, as stocks notch record highs and the market is on track for its best month of the year. A late surge in the final stretch of trading pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJIA) to close above 40,000 for the first time ever Friday — a milestone that comes just 874 trading days after the Dow first closed above 30,000. The blue-chip index added 1.2% for the week, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq (^IXIC) both recorded their longest weekly winning streaks since February. “Psychologically it's amusing,” JPMorgan Asset Management’s Jack Manley said of the milestone on Yahoo Finance’s ‘Morning Brief.’ “The rally feels good because the macro data has been pretty good,” he said. Goldman Sachs (GS), Microsoft (MSFT), and UnitedHealth (UNH) were the top three point contributors to the Dow’s charge from 30,000 to 40,000. And the makeup of the Dow looks different than it did during previous milestones. The index most recently replaced Walgreens (WBA) with Amazon (AMZN), bringing it to its current composition. This week’s softer inflation print helped bolster the case for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates before year end, as more investors place their bets on a soft landing. In a note to clients this week, Truist co-chief investment strategist Keith Lerner wrote the recent rally is a “healthy sign and typical characteristic of a bull market,” suggesting “upside potential remains.”",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/dow-at-40000-why-stocks-still-have-plenty-of-room-to-run-160152850.html,AMZN

Jim Cramer said that the NASDAQ, S&P 500 and the Dow recently touching record ""defies"" the conventional wisdom on ""what could happen"" at this stage of the business cycle.

This growth was supported by a 14% increase in sales and a margin expansion of 521 basis points, bringing the aggregate margin to 22.8%. However, this overall performance conceals the varying fortunes of the individual companies, the analysis showed. Meta Platforms, Alphabet, and Amazon outperformed expectations with sales growth of 27%, 15%, and 13% respectively, leading to year-to-date share price increases of 34%, 25%, and 21%. These gains reflect a stronger market performance for these companies relative to some of their peers. In stark contrast, Apple's sales saw a 4% decline, while Tesla experienced a 9% drop in revenues. Consequently, their stock prices have been impacted, with Apple's shares dipping by 1% and Tesla's plummeting by 30%. This downturn has led to Tesla's ranking falling to the 12th largest stock in the S&P 500 index.

"Amazon.com, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Stock Has Fared Decently: Is the Market Following Strong Financials?",17/5/2024 22:29,editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St)17 May 2024 at 3:29 pm·3-min read,"Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock is up by 9.0% over the past three months. Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term financial health, we decided to study the company’s fundamentals to see if they could be influencing the market. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Amazon.com's  ROE today. ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.  See our latest analysis for Amazon.com  The formula for return on equity is: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Amazon.com is: 17% = US$38b ÷ US$217b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024). The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.17 in profit. So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics. To start with, Amazon.com's ROE looks acceptable. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 17%. This certainly adds some context to Amazon.com's moderate 9.4% net income growth seen over the past five years.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-com-inc-nasdaq-amzn-222957758.html,AMZN

Low rates are favorable for stocks as they reduce the cost of borrowing, often needed to finance the expansion of companies. Lower rates typically reduce the attractiveness of fixed-income investments like bonds, leading investors to seek higher returns in the equity markets. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, around 70% of traders now expect at least one cut by the September meeting, a notable increase from a week ago.

Walmart Is Firing On All Cylinders And That Includes Its Newer Businesses That Go Beyond Groceries,17/5/2024 14:49,Upwallstreet17 May 2024 at 7:49 am·3-min read,"On Thursday, Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT) surpassed estimates with fiscal first quarter earnings and revenue expectations. The discounter significantly expanded its e-commerce sales and boosted profits with newer businesses, including advertising and its efforts to appeal to more affluent shoppers in order to fight off rivals like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN). While Walmart is the nation’s biggest retailer, Amazon leads when it comes to e-commerce, but Walmart is determined to stop being the underdog in this rare arena as well as to grow outside groceries. For the quarter ended on April 30th, the big box retailer reported that sales grew 6% YoY to $161.51 billion, surpassing $159.50 billion that LSEG estimated. Net income also grew from last year's comparable quarter as it amounted to $5.10 billion, or 63 cents per share. Excluding fuel, Walmart’s same-store sales in the U.S. grew 3.8%. Also excluding fuel, Sam’s Club same-store sales grew 4.4%. Boosted by its growing third-party marketplace, as well as rise of both store pickup and delivery of online orders, e-commerce sales impressively rose 22% YoY in the U.S. However, despite more visits, both physical ones to its stores and online to its website, consumers spent roughly the same compared to last year’s quarter as average ticket remained flat, but transactions rose 3.8%. But, Walmart’s newer businesses kicked in with third of YoY increase in operating income coming from that segment. Global advertising grew 24% and 26% in the U.S. alone. Like Amazon, Walmart expanded its online footprint by welcoming sellers onto its platform and offering them advertisement and fulfillment services. Its U.S., marketplace sellers rose 36%, while the total count in Mexico went up almost 80%. Walmart's grocery business has been fueled by the widening gap between fast-food and restaurant pricing versus the lower cost of home cooking. Also, for the first time, its delivery business surpassed its store pickup in terms of volume, showing that shoppers appreciate the convenience that Walmart offers, as they are coming more frequently than they have before, along with newer customers.Outlook Walmart is now expecting to hit the high end or slightly top its previous full-year guidance. It previously guided for net sales growth between 3% and 4% with adjusted earnings per share of between $2.23 and $2.37. Walmart is doing better than others. The nation’s largest retailer and private employer is often considered as an indicator of the state of the U.S. economy. However, it is doing way better than the U.S. economy during such inflationary periods as it sells essentials like groceries that made about 60% of sales in its most recent fiscal year and when it comes to staples, its value-oriented reputation precedes the big-box retailer. But, in order to fight off rivals like Amazon, Walmart is also expanding its target demographics with its efforts to appeal to younger and high-income shoppers and these new businesses both lifted its profits during the quarter and also fueled the growth of its operating margin that surpasses its sales growth. Earlier this week, Walmart announced layoffs, along with news of reallocating hundreds of employees, but CFO John David Rainey emphasized that this move is not about cost cuts but about shifting away from remote work as the company’s corporate culture is about being together. By the looks of it, Walmart management knows what it's doing. DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

Why This 1 Growth Stock Could Be a Great Addition to Your Portfolio,17/5/2024 13:45,Zacks Equity Research17 May 2024 at 6:45 am·2-min read,"For new and old investors, taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals. Many investors also have a go-to methodology that helps guide their buy and sell decisions. One way to find winning stocks based on your preferred way of investing is to use the Zacks Style Scores, which are indicators that rate stocks based on three widely-followed investing types: value, growth, and momentum. Why This 1 Growth Stock Should Be On Your Watchlist Different than value or momentum investors, growth-oriented investors are concerned with a stock's future prospects, and the overall financial health and strength of a company. Thus, they'll want to focus on the Growth Style Score, which analyzes characteristics like projected and historical earnings, sales, and cash flow to find stocks that will see sustainable growth over time. Amazon (AMZN) Amazon.com is one of the largest e-commerce providers, with sprawling operations in North America, now spreading across the globe. AMZN boasts a Growth Style Score of A and VGM Score of A, and holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating. Its bottom-line is projected to rise 56.6% year-over-year for 2024, while Wall Street anticipates its top line to improve by 11%. 12 analysts revised their earnings estimate higher in the last 60 days for fiscal 2024, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.48 to $4.54 per share. AMZN also boasts an average earnings surprise of 48.2%. On a historic basis, Amazon has generated cash flow growth of 25.3%, and is expected to report cash flow expansion of 59.4% this year.

"Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",17/5/2024 13:00,Zacks Equity Research17 May 2024 at 6:00 am·5-min read,"Amazon (AMZN) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term. Over the past month, shares of this online retailer have returned +2.5%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, which Amazon falls in, has gained 5.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction? Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision. Revisions to Earnings Estimates Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock. We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. Amazon is expected to post earnings of $1.02 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +61.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +9.6%. The consensus earnings estimate of $4.54 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +56.6%. This estimate has changed +14.5% over the last 30 days. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.77 indicates a change of +27.1% from what Amazon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +4%. Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Amazon is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-com-inc-amzn-trending-130016096.html,AMZN
Time for Cloud ETFs on Earnings Strength & Promising Growth?,17/5/2024 12:00,Sanghamitra Saha17 May 2024 at 5:00 am·3-min read,"Cloud computing has been at the forefront of the growth in technology for the past few years, offering efficient solutions for businesses and consumers. The global cloud computing market is expected to grow from $626.4 billion in 2023 to $1.27 billion by 2028 at a CAGR of 15.1%, per MarketsandMarkets. The widespread adoption of remote work and e-commerce has continued to fuel the need for scalable and reliable cloud solutions. Moreover, advancements in cloud technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and cybersecurity enhancements, have expanded the use cases for cloud services, attracting a broader customer base. The global cloud computing market is led by three mega cloud service providers — Microsoft, Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services. The total cloud infrastructure market was worth $76 billion worldwide at the end of Q1 of 2024, which marked a year-over-year rise of 21%. According to recent data from Synergy Research Group cited on CRN, AWS, Microsoft and Google collectively managed a 67% share of the $76 billion global cloud infrastructure services market in the first quarter of 2024. Google-parent Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT and Amazon AMZN recently reported their quarterly financial cloud numbers for the first quarter of 2024. Each company logged record quarterly cloud sales thanks to double-digit growth rates. Combined, these three cloud leaders generated more than $61 billion in total sales in the first quarter of 2024. Their cloud units, in fact, boosted total revenue growth as clients are increasingly adopting AI services. Growth rates are rebounding from the relative lows seen through most of 2023. Individually, Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud business generated $26.7 billion in total sales (up 21% year over year) during the quarter, meaning Microsoft’s cloud group now has a run rate of $107 billion. AWS generated just over $25 billion in revenues (up 17% year over year). This means Amazon’s cloud business now has an annual run rate of $100 billion. Google Cloud reported total sales of $9.6 billion (up 28% year over year). This shows that Alphabet’s cloud business currently has an annual run rate of $38.4 billion. In terms of global market share, AWS is leading (with a 31% share), followed by Microsoft (25%) and Google (11%). Other cloud market-share leaders of the first quarter included Alibaba BABA at 4% market share and Salesforce CRM at 3% cloud share.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/time-cloud-etfs-earnings-strength-120000396.html,AMZN
TV companies flaunt ad tech and AI to persuade advertisers to spend,17/5/2024 10:03,Dawn Chmielewski17 May 2024 at 3:03 am·3-min read,"By Dawn Chmielewski NEW YORK (Reuters) - Television ""upfront"" advertiser presentations this week in New York City were hardly about TV at all. The annual week-long affair where media executives have traditionally pre-sold TV advertising featured many familiar trappings: pop stars Alicia Keys and Billie Eilish dazzled packed auditoriums with live performances; celebrities Kevin Hart, Reese Witherspoon and Ryan Reynolds hawked their latest projects, and Super Bowl star Tom Brady joined other pro athletes on stage. But it was ad tech and artificial intelligence that was getting all the attention. Warner Bros Discovery talked up shoppable ads on its Max streaming service. Google's YouTube introduced a new AI-powered format to place non-skippable ads on videos streamed to internet-connected TVs. Netflix advertising chief Amy Reinhard said the streamer would develop its own in-house ad technology that would give advertisers new ways to buy and gain new insights. Ad tech even featured in punchlines. ""You're probably wondering why I am so giddy today,"" joked late-night host Jimmy Kimmel at Walt Disney's presentation. ""It's because Disney is using proprietary meta-tagging data that leverages video intelligence to tap into the moods and emotions within the content we create. That's why I'm so proud of what we've done here."" Streaming players also sought to win over advertisers from traditional media rivals by emphasizing their increasing reach. Netflix's Reinhard said the company's ad-supported plan now has 40 million global monthly users, up from 5 million a year ago. In countries where Netflix offers a version of its service with advertising, it accounts for 40% of all sign-ups, she said. Chief Content Officer Bela Bajaria touted the chart-topping popularity of shows like its period drama ""Bridgerton"" and the streaming service's expanded investment in big, live events, including a splashy deal to stream two NFL professional football games on Christmas Day.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/tv-companies-flaunt-ad-tech-100343781.html,AMZN
"Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Amazon, Meta, Alphabet and Apple",17/5/2024 9:27,Zacks Equity Research17 May 2024 at 2:27 am·6-min read,"Chicago, IL – May 17, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Amazon AMZN, Meta Platforms META, Alphabet GOOGL and Apple AAPL. It’s been a long road back to new highs for many tech companies. While several of the Magnificent 7 stocks already eclipsed their former highs, one recently broke out in conjunction with the broader Nasdaq Composite index. One of the largest e-commerce companies in the world, Amazon maintains a strong position in the online retail marketplace, backed by its Prime membership with ultrafast delivery services. The company has diversified into a host of other categories and is now the leading provider of cloud infrastructure as a service to enterprise customers with its Amazon Web Services (AWS) offering. An expanding global presence and growing capabilities in areas such as generative AI, health care, grocery, and autonomous driving are major tailwinds for Amazon moving forward. Amazon, currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is benefitting from underlying momentum in both retail and technology sectors. Shares are displaying relative strength as buying pressure accumulates in this market leader. The company is part of the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry group, which currently ranks in the top 36% out of more than 250 Zacks Ranked Industries. Because it is ranked in the top half of all Zacks Ranked Industries, we expect this group to outperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months. This group is widely outperforming the market over the past year. Historical research studies suggest that approximately half of a stock’s price appreciation is due to its industry grouping. In fact, the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. It’s no secret that investing in stocks that are part of leading industry groups can give us a leg up relative to the market. By focusing on leading stocks within the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries, we can dramatically improve our stock-picking success. Amazon's financial prowess is undeniable, with its first-quarter results propelled by Prime and AWS. Earlier in May, the tech behemoth delivered adjusted Q1 earnings of $1.13/share, a 264% jump from the year-ago period. The figure topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 36.1%. Net revenues of $143.31 billion during the quarter rose 13% year-over-year.

Netflix's NFL deal highlights streamer's 'natural evolution' as sports rights take center stage,19/5/2024 12:16,Alexandra Canal·Senior ReporterUpdated 19 May 2024 at 5:16 am·4-min read,"Netflix's (NFLX) surprise three-season deal with the NFL marks a major shift for the streaming giant, which has historically avoided traditional live sports investments. As part of the deal, the platform will stream two Christmas Day games: the Pittsburgh Steelers taking on the Kansas City Chiefs, followed by a matchup between the Baltimore Ravens and Houston Texans. Some on Wall Street view the move as more of an experiment for Netflix, with streaming platforms pressured to expand their offerings, especially amid the recent introduction of advertising tiers. ""I think this is much more about testing the waters, learning how to do advertising inside of sports,"" Citi analyst Jason Bazinet told Yahoo Finance, arguing the NFL won't necessarily help the streamer retain subscribers over the long term. ""Down the road, [Netflix will] presumably bid on more sports rights and do more advertising,"" he surmised. ""I think it's a good thing. It's just a natural evolution of the business."" The deal comes as the NFL has been adding more streaming services as media partners. The list also includes Amazon's Prime Video (AMZN) and Comcast's Peacock (CMCSA). And Google's YouTube TV (GOOG, GOOGL) has the exclusive rights to NFL Sunday Ticket, which makes out-of-market games available to fans nationwide. JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth wrote in a note to clients that he believes the games will help offer a boost to Netflix's ad tier and enable the company to ""actively promote"" its own content during the games. Netflix — which will reportedly pay less than $150 million per game, according to Bloomberg — will also bring large global distribution to the NFL, according to Anmuth. ""Last year’s 3 NFL Christmas Day games ranked among the top 25 most viewed TV programs in 2023. With the partnership spanning 3 years, we believe NFLX could deepen its relationship with the NFL, especially as the league looks to further diversify its distribution strategy & we would expect more live sports over time,"" he wrote. Jefferies agreed, writing in a research note following the news, ""We are positive on the NFL deal, which we believe will create a compelling value proposition for NFLX's emerging ad business.""",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/netflixs-nfl-deal-highlights-streamers-natural-evolution-as-sports-rights-take-center-stage-080037882.html,AMZN
Walmart is nabbing Target’s ‘Tar-jay’ rep and Amazon’s delivery crowd as even the wealthy flock to the retail giant,16/5/2024 20:30,Sasha Rogelberg16 May 2024 at 1:30 pm·4-min read,"Walmart makes the big-box retail business look easy. The Arkansas-based retailer long known as a discount store has not only retained its budget-hunting customer, but it’s now also going after the wealthier crowd of competitors Target and Amazon. The company reported 6% revenue growth to $161.5 billion and a comparable sales growth of 3.8% in its first quarter Thursday, which it said was driven by upper-income shoppers. Walmart was so optimistic it raised its outlook for growth to 4% from 3% for the year and expects adjusted earnings to be $2.37 per share, up from $2.23. “We are seeing customers trade into Walmart,” Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey told Bloomberg on Thursday. “We’ve historically been thought of for value, but now it’s value, quality and convenience.” Walmart attributed its growth to its 21% surge in e-commerce revenue, led by curbside pick-up and delivery orders—a service typically favored by wealthier consumers looking for convenience. It also gained market share in groceries as consumers continue to stray from discretionary purchases in favor of just buying the essentials. Customers making over $100,000 have contributed the most to Walmart’s market share takeover, according to analyst Neil Saunders of GlobalData, and the retailer’s strategies of late reflect its desire to keep that the case. In April, Walmart announced the release of the premium own-brand food line bettergoods, with a focus on bright packaging and plant-based items to appeal to Gen Z and bougie shoppers. Earlier this year the retailer remodeled and revamped 800 locations, stocking wider shelves with $50 silk sleep masks and $230 duck breast. The company plans to remodel 900 stores in 2024, CEO Doug McMillon said in the company’s earnings presentation. These tactics are on top of its consistent discount efforts, which McMillon said have been key to Walmart continuing to resonate with its consumer base—particularly as consumer sentiment reaches a six-month low despite cooling inflation—and have kept analysts upbeat on the company. “Despite a volatile consumer spending backdrop, increased concerns on the health of the low-end consumer, and the relative resiliency of shares of [Walmart], we approach its [first quarter] print with optimism,” Deutsche Bank analyst Krisztina Katai wrote. While Walmart has moved to appeal to higher-income consumers, historically higher-income-focused Target has gone in the opposite direction as the company lags in sales. Regarded for its cheap-chic, Tar-jay reputation, the Minnesota retailer has pivoted to lower-income customers, launching in February its “dealworthy” budget brands with most items under $10. It’s not an all-in endeavor for Target: The company also launched its own paid membership, Target Circle 360, mirroring Amazon Prime and Walmart+ efforts to tap into well-to-do customers looking for convenience. Amazon has made similar moves to compete with Walmart’s e-commerce rally, introducing last month an unlimited grocery delivery service under $10 for Amazon Prime members, with the same service available for EBT cardholders without Prime for $4.99. Last July, Walmart rolled out Walmart+ Assist and cut the price of its paid membership in half for those receiving government assistance. Walmart’s grocery delivery services eclipsed Amazon’s since 2019, with Insider Intelligence predicting recently that Walmart orders will make up 26.9% of online grocery sales by the end of 2024, with Amazon making up 18.5%. While the big-box retailer has expanded to 4.4 billion units delivered in the past 12 months, Amazon Prime reported last month it delivered 4 billion items for same or next-day delivery in the U.S. in 2023. Other factors are keeping Walmart on top: The company grew its advertising business 24%, a venture with higher margins than retail. It laid off hundreds of its corporate staff earlier this week, relocating many remote employees to its Arkansas headquarters, a decision that came on the heels of its move to shutter all 51 of its health care clinics. Walmart decreased U.S. inventory 4.2% as an additional cost-cutting measure.  But Oliver Chen, an analyst at TD Cowen, told Bloomberg in March that Walmart’s real advantage lies in its potential to tap into customers across tax brackets.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-nabbing-target-tar-jay-203035404.html,AMZN

These 2 Retail-Wholesale Stocks Could Beat Earnings: Why They Should Be on Your Radar,16/5/2024 13:00,Zacks Equity Research16 May 2024 at 6:00 am·2-min read,"Two factors often determine stock prices in the long run: earnings and interest rates. Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter. The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher. 2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist The Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction. The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) earns a Zacks Rank #3 13 days from its next quarterly earnings release on May 29, 2024, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $2.97 a share. DKS has an Earnings ESP figure of 0.06%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $2.97 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.96. DKS is just one of a large group of Retail-Wholesale stocks with a positive ESP figure. Amazon (AMZN) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider. Amazon, which is readying to report earnings on August 1, 2024, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $1.03 a share, and AMZN is 77 days out from its next earnings report. Amazon's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 1.31% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.02. DKS and AMZN's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/2-retail-wholesale-stocks-could-130004747.html,AMZN
D.C. is testing its Big Tech antitrust campaign far from D.C.,16/5/2024 8:00,Alexis Keenan·Reporter16 May 2024 at 1:00 am·6-min read,"The Biden administration is testing its antitrust push far from Washington as it seeks to unwind the dominance of Big Tech. No longer is the nation’s capital the go-to trial venue of choice for the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission as they file competition challenges against the biggest names in Silicon Valley. Instead, it’s New Jersey where the government chose to sue Apple (AAPL). Or California, where it challenged Microsoft (MSFT). Or the state of Washington, where it confronted Amazon (AMZN). Or Virginia, where it filed a second antitrust suit against Google (GOOG, GOOGL). ""They’re clearly filing these tech cases in different jurisdictions where the law is less developed,"" said Douglas Ross, a professor of antitrust at the University of Washington School of Law. ""And they're doing it for a reason."" A variety of strategies could explain the multi-jurisdictional approach, according to antitrust lawyers. Prosecutors could be targeting appeals courts with case law more favorable to their legal theories, since all of the district courts selected by Biden’s FTC and DOJ report to different courts of appeals. The government could also be weighing the speed of a court in handling litigation and the convenience to anticipated witnesses, said Juan Arteaga, a partner with Crowell & Moring’s antitrust litigation division. It’s also possible, he added, that government officials may want to showcase vigorous anticompetitive enforcement to the rest of the country.

Amazon axed more than 100 customer service managers in CEO Andy Jassy’s latest job cuts,16/5/2024 0:49,Jason Del Rey15 May 2024 at 5:49 pm·2-min read,"Amazon on Wednesday slashed layers of middle management in some of its customer service divisions as part of an organizational restructuring, Fortune has learned. The cuts affected more than 100 customer service managers working in Level 5 and Level 6 middle management positions both in call centers and virtually. Impacted employees worked mainly in either the U.S. or India. Some of the managers first realized something was up when their computer systems suddenly shut down during their workday, according to one source. ""We have had more and more work added, 12-16 hour days, maximum stress to be cut free without a thought or a warning,"" one of those impacted by the cuts told Fortune. An Amazon spokesperson said that the restructuring was intended in part to shrink the distance between customers and customer service leaders. The layoffs impacted less than 1 percent of the global Amazon customer service workforce, the company said, but it was unclear what percentage of the customer service division's management team was impacted. “As part of a shift in how our Worldwide Customer Service organization is structured, we’ve identified a relatively small number of roles that are no longer required,"" Amazon spokesperson Montana MacLachlan said in a statement. ""We did not make these decisions lightly, and we are committed to supporting employees whose roles are affected during their transition."" The affected US employees will receive pay and benefits for 60 days plus severance, the company said. The layoffs come two weeks after Amazon posted strong first-quarter financial results with more than $143 billion in revenue and $10 billion in profit. Amazon under CEO Andy Jassy has finally hit an inflection point where it can both invest heavily in long-term bets like generative AI while at the same time pumping out needle-moving profits. The company has reached this point, in part, due to Jassy's willingness to oversee the largest corporate layoffs in Amazon's history in recent years and demand that his leaders continually squeeze out excess costs wherever possible. Amazon divisions such as AWS, Prime Video, and Twitch have all cut hundreds of employees this year. Amazon has also worked this year to shift major logistics costs from its own books to those of third-party merchants in the form of new, controversial seller fees. ""[W]e don’t believe that we’re at the end of what we can do in terms of improving our cost structure on the store side,"" Jassy told Wall Street analysts during its earnings call last month. News of some of the customer service layoffs first surfaced in a LinkedIn post written by a former Amazon general manager named Tony Carr.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-axed-more-100-customer-004905633.html,AMZN
"Jeff Bezos revealed his secret to Amazon’s success 25 years ago: ‘I asked everyone around here to wake up terrified every morning, their sheets drenched in sweat’",15/5/2024 22:59,Chloe Berger15 May 2024 at 3:59 pm·3-min read,"Back in the 90s, Jeff Bezos went on record as hoping his employees would wake up on the wrong side of the bed—for the greater good, or for the customer at the very least. Today marks the anniversary of when the former online bookstore went public in 1997 with an original IPO price of $18 per share, catapulting Bezos into millionaire status almost immediately. Now, Amazon shares are going for $185.99 each as of market close, Bezos is worth more than $200 billion, and the company sells almost everything under the sun (including, but really not limited, to books). A quarter of a century ago, in 1999, when Bezos was CEO, he revealed his nascent hard-line leadership strategy with CNET's Wendy Walsh. Two years after Amazon first went public, Bezos was already a billionaire, sharing his take on what built his booming e-commerce business. Praising his employees for being “the hardest working, most talented, most passionate, most customer-focused,” group of people, Bezos really hammered home the customer-service part. Taking it a step further than satisfaction guaranteed, he seemingly suggested that if workers aren’t waking up in abject fear of disturbing their customer base, then they’re doing it wrong. “I asked everyone around here to wake up terrified every morning, their sheets drenched in sweat,” he said. The purported goal was not to have a dehydrated Silicon Valley office staff, but to ensure that no one rests on their laurels. Of course, he implored employees “to be very precise about what it is they’re afraid of,” instead of waking up in wet sheets for the sake of it, presumably. “They shouldn’t be afraid of our competitors; they should be afraid of our customers because those are the folks we have a relationship with,” Bezos said. “Those are the folks who send us money,” he added. In the interview, Bezos noted that things could always change on a dime for Amazon.com. Recognizing that the company wasn’t long-lasting yet, it could “still lose our whole opportunity to make that little bit of history” if they don’t “focus obsessively on the customer.” Bezos’ fixation on his clients is not unlike an unrequited crush, fueled by the knowledge of the other playing hard to get or being temperamental. “I believe that our customers are loyal to us right up until the second that somebody else offers them better service,” he said. Even the current Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has spoken about Bezos’ demands of his workers. “Watching Jeff, I have never seen anybody with higher standards,” Jassy said at Fortune’s World Economic Forum in Davos this year. This esteeming of the customer appears to come at a price, or at least some controversy. Some workers have called Bezos and Amazon out for harsh conditions. Bezos’ mindset has since come under fire as his company and net worth grew. In 2015, the New York Times released an explosive feature regarding the high standards at Amazon which included, at times, working past midnight, a tense company culture, and simply a lack of work-life balance for the sake of a high salary and belief in the mission.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/jeff-bezos-revealed-secret-amazon-225933347.html,AMZN

"Netflix strikes three-season NFL deal, will air two games this year",15/5/2024 14:27,Alexandra Canal·Senior Reporter15 May 2024 at 7:27 am·3-min read,"Netflix (NFLX) has won the streaming rights to two National Football League (NFL) games set to air Christmas Day, the company announced in a post on X, formerly Twitter, Wednesday morning. It's a surprising development given the streaming giant has previously said it wanted to avoid investing in live sports content. The doubleheader matchups will be announced once the NFL releases its full schedule Wednesday evening. The company will reportedly pay less than $150 million per game, according to Bloomberg. In addition to this year's games, the company also revealed it will be streaming at least one holiday game per year as part of a three-season deal. ""Last year, we decided to take a big bet on live — tapping into massive fandoms across comedy, reality TV, sports, and more,"" Netflix chief content officer Bela Bajaria said in a news release. ""There are no live annual events, sports or otherwise, that compare with the audiences NFL football attracts. We’re so excited that the NFL’s Christmas Day games will be only on Netflix."" Netflix had previously maintained that it wanted to focus on ""sports entertainment"" instead of paying for the rights to live sports, which can be expensive for media companies. In the past, the company has released docuseries and sports-adjacent content like ""The Quarterback,"" ""Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"" ""Full Swing,"" and ""Break Point,"" in addition to live sporting events like the ""Netflix Cup"" celebrity golf tournament, which aired late last year. One recently announced partnership seemed to deviate from that status quo. In January, Netflix announced a 10-year deal with TKO Group Holding's WWE (TKO) that will bring WWE’s flagship program Raw, a live wrestling production, to the streaming service beginning in 2025. But at the time, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said the program's inclusion did not signal a change in its overall sports strategy, describing the deal as ""unique"" compared to the global sports rights of professional leagues like the NBA or UFC. Wall Street analysts and industry watchers have long predicted Netflix will eventually be forced to go all-in on sports, describing live sports as the last frontier of streaming amid a deteriorating cable bundle. ""Eventually we expect Netflix to move into live sports, particularly as it scales in [free cash flow] generation and has the ability to invest in major sports rights around the world,"" Morgan Stanley said in a report published last June. ""In addition, as its advertising capabilities scale, we think live sports will fit well into its content offering.""",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-strikes-three-season-nfl-deal-will-air-two-games-this-year-142733733.html,AMZN
3 Streaming Stocks Capitalizing on Rising Demand for Bundling,15/5/2024 13:33,Vasundhara Sawalka15 May 2024 at 6:33 am·5-min read,"As the streaming landscape continues to evolve, strategic partnerships and bundled offerings represent a concerted effort by companies like Comcast CMCSA, Amazon AMZN and Warner Bros. Discovery WBD, among others, to streamline consumer options, retain subscribers and achieve profitability in an increasingly saturated market.With the average U.S. consumer subscribing to four streaming services and spending around $61 per month, according to Deloitte's Digital Media Trends report, retaining loyal subscribers has become a challenge.Apple AAPL, for instance, has been offering Apple One since late 2020. It combines Apple TV+ with other services like Apple Music and Apple Arcade. Disney, which has also been offering a bundle with Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+, officially began its domestic rollout of a one-app experience late last year that incorporates Hulu content via Disney+ — a similar play to Paramount's Showtime combination as well as the integration of HBO Max and Discovery+, both of which merged their respective services last year.While the concept of bundling is not new, the partnership between competing media companies is gaining traction. Bundling multiple services into a single offering aims to provide a more convenient and cost-effective solution for users. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Recently, Comcast announced the upcoming launch of a new bundled offering called StreamSaver. This bundle will combine the company's own Peacock platform with popular services like Netflix NFLX and Apple TV+. Comcast’s forthcoming package is an effort to reduce cancellation rates and provide a more efficient means of subscriber acquisition as the traditional cable TV business continues to deteriorate.The StreamSaver package will be available later this month exclusively for Comcast's broadband Internet customers, ahead of another price hike for the standalone Peacock service, which goes into effect for new customers starting Jul 18 prior to the 2024 Paris Summer Olympic Games. Beginning in mid-July, the price for Peacock Premium (with ads) will increase by $2 to $7.99 per month and that for Peacock Premium Plus (mostly ad-free) will go up by $2 to $13.99 per month.This strategic move comes amid growing pressure on media companies to scale their streaming services and achieve profitability in an increasingly competitive market dominated by tech giants like Amazon and Alphabet-owned YouTube, among others.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CMCSA's 2024 revenues is pegged at $123.16 billion, indicating 1.3% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $4.21 per share, indicating 5.8% year-over-year growth. Seeking further scale in the streaming business, Warner Bros. Discovery announced a collaboration with Disney Entertainment for a new streaming bundle that would combine Disney+ and Disney’s Hulu with Warner Bros.’ Max, which includes an array of programming from the studio and its premium service, HBO. The new bundle will be available for purchase on any of the three streaming platform’s websites and offered as both an ad-supported and ad-free plan.The easiest way to boost revenues is to raise prices, but it comes with the risk of more people cancelling their subscriptions. The lowest-priced Max plan is currently $9.99 a month with advertisements. Disney+ with Hulu is also offered with ads for $9.99 a month.Among other things, the collaborative effort is likely to put the two major comic-book rivals, Disney’s Marvel and Warner Bros.’ DC, together in a cooperative venture, beginning this summer in the United States. Disney+ has more than 100 million subscribers, while Hulu reaches another 50 million. Including the linear version of HBO, Max reaches more than 97 million homes.Earlier this year, Warner Bros. announced a sports streaming partnership with Disney's ESPN and Fox, set to debut later this fall. In December, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company partnered with Netflix on a $10 ad-supported bundle offered through Verizon.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for WBD's 2024 revenues is pegged at $41.36 billion, indicating 0.11% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at a loss of 34 cents per share, indicating 73.4% year-over-year growth. Amazon continues to explore ways to bolster its Prime program on the back of its streaming service, Prime Video.

Jeff Bezos' Mom Was A Single Teen Who Took Him To Night School With Her As An Infant — She Made $190 A Month And Now She's Worth $30 Billion,14/5/2024 18:45,Jeannine Mancini14 May 2024 at 11:45 am·3-min read,"The tale of Jeff Bezos, who started Amazon from his garage, is legendary, but the story of his mother, Jacklyn Bezos, is equally compelling. Jacklyn, a determined teenager in Albuquerque, New Mexico, overcame substantial obstacles. She faced financial hardship and societal pressures as a single teen mother, yet she managed to raise her son, who would become one of the world's richest individuals with a net worth of $205 billion, according to Forbes. Don't Miss: No generation before Gen Z has had this investment opportunity – How successful Zoomers plan to retire in their 30's. The average American couple has saved this much money for retirement — How do you compare? While still in high school at 17, Jacklyn became pregnant and met with severe resistance from school administrators. They initially forbade her from continuing her education. Undeterred, Jacklyn challenged their decision, asserting, ""It didn't make any sense to me, so I pushed back and I kept on pushing back."" Ultimately, the school relented under her persistence, though they imposed strict conditions on her return, such as restricted interaction with peers and tightly controlled entry and exit times. Despite these hurdles, Jacklyn persevered, graduating from high school and shortly after divorcing Bezos’s biological father, Ted Jorgensen. She supported herself and her son by working as a secretary, earning a modest $190 per month, which barely covered their expenses. To stay connected with her parents without the cost of a telephone, Jacklyn’s father set up a walkie-talkie system for daily check-ins. Driven to further her education, Jacklyn enrolled in night school, strategically choosing classes that allowed her to bring her infant son, Jeff, along. ""I would show up with an infant and two duffel bags,"" she said. One was filled with textbooks and baby supplies, the other with distractions for her son during class. Trending: If the United States had access to today’s high-yield savings accounts rates in 2015, it wouldn’t need to save another penny. It was during these night classes that she met Mike Bezos, a Cuban refugee, who would later become Jeff’s stepfather and a significant figure in his life. The family relocated for Mike’s job, which delayed Jacklyn’s educational ambitions for years. Nonetheless, she returned to college as an adult, ultimately graduating from the College of Saint Elizabeth at age 40. ""When I graduated...I had never been more proud of myself. I felt 10 feet tall,"" she expressed. According to a 1997 SEC filing, Jackie and her husband, Mike Bezos, invested $245,573 in Amazon. As the company grew into a global powerhouse, the initial investment ballooned to an estimated $958 billion. While they donated a significant portion of their shares to educational causes, Bloomberg estimates that their remaining holdings could be worth around $30 billion today.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/jeff-bezos-mom-single-teen-184512984.html,AMZN
Google Search gets biggest overhaul in years with new generative AI features,14/5/2024 17:55,Daniel Howley·Technology Editor14 May 2024 at 10:55 am·3-min read,"Google (GOOG, GOOGL) on Tuesday announced some of the biggest changes to its Search product in years, rolling out generative AI features to offer more complete and direct answers to queries. The company will roll out its generative AI updates to US users beginning today and more than a billion people worldwide by the end of the year. The announcement, as part of Google’s I/O developer conference, brings a new look to Search via its AI Overview. The feature provides a brief, AI-generated answer to searches, coupled with a series of links to the sources cited in the response. Google is also working on answering more complex answers via an update in Search Labs — which offers users the ability to test upcoming capabilities. The company says you'll be able to search for a yoga or Pilates studio in Boston that offers discounts to new members and how far it is from Beacon Hill, and Search will provide an answer without you having to perform multiple searches. It will also allow you to do things like look for meal plans for a group or put together a vacation itinerary. There is also a new video search option coming to Search Labs, which enables users to take a video and use it as a search prompt. In one example, the company says a user dealing with a problem related to a record player arm would be able to take a video of the issue, and Search would be able to provide an AI Overview explanation of the malfunction and how to address it. But don’t expect this multistep or video search to be available today. Google said it’s coming to its Search Labs soon and will only be available for English queries in the US for now. I’ve been using AI Overview, and it's been a helpful addition to Search, whether I was looking for information about obscure video games from the 1990s or about how to treat a foot injury. All of these functions come as part of Google’s effort to push generative AI across its massive ecosystem of products including Android, YouTube, Gmail, and more.

Amazon AWS CEO Adam Selipsky is out,14/5/2024 15:04,Jason Del Rey14 May 2024 at 8:04 am·2-min read,"Amazon Web Services CEO Adam Selipsky is stepping down, the tech giant announced on Tuesday, around three years after he made a return to the tech giant to replace Andy Jassy as CEO of the company's cloud computing division. Selipsky will be replaced by Matt Garman, who has spent around 18 years with the company and most recently served as the senior vice president of sales and marketing for AWS. In a blog post, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that when he recruited Selipsky back to AWS after a stint as Tableau's CEO, ""we agreed that if he accepted the role, he’d likely do it for a few years, and that one of the things he’d focus on during that time was helping prepare the next generation of leadership."" Before Tableau, Selipsky spent more than 11 years at Amazon during his first tenure. ""We were fortunate that Adam agreed to step in and lead AWS, and has deftly led the business, while also developing his leadership team,"" Jassy added. ""Adam is now going to move onto his next challenge (after taking a well-deserved respite), and Matt Garman will become CEO of AWS, effective June 3rd."" The leadership change comes shortly after Amazon announced in its most recent earnings report that its revenue growth was accelerating in its cloud computing division and was on track to surpass $100 billion by the end of 2024. Company leaders also said that generative AI products and services were on track to bring in multiple billions in revenue this year. At the same time, AWS has faced numerous challenges under Selipsky's leadership, with multiple rounds of layoffs, a period of revenue growth deceleration, and the optics among some industry observers that the company has been chasing competitors from behind during the generative AI boom. To that end, Amazon has invested $4 billion into the AI foundational model company Anthropic, with AWS becoming the ""primary cloud provider for mission critical workloads.” As part of the tie-up, Anthropic has agreed to train and deploy future models using AWS AI chips.

Amazon Web Services CEO to step down,14/5/2024 14:50,"Clare Duffy, CNN14 May 2024 at 7:50 am·2-min read","Amazon’s biggest moneymaker, Amazon Web Services, is getting a new leader. Adam Selipsky, the chief executive of the cloud computing unit, will step down from his role next month, the company announced Tuesday. Selipsky, who first joined AWS in 2005 — before its services were even publicly available — has led the business since 2021, when previous AWS CEO Andy Jassy was promoted to lead all of Amazon. Matt Garman, currently vice president of sales, marketing and global services, will take over as AWS CEO starting June 3. The leader of AWS is of major consequence to the larger company, as the cloud computing business makes up nearly two-thirds of Amazon’s overall profits. And with annual revenue of more than $90 billion last year, AWS is larger than many standalone companies. AWS is also at a pivotal moment with the growth of artificial intelligence, as it rolls out new tools and capacity in hopes of becoming the computing provider of choice for the next wave of technology. But it faces fierce competition from other major players, including Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure. Amazon Web Services’ sales have grown more than 85% since Selipsky’s takeover. Amazon shares dipped more than 1% Tuesday following the announcement. However, Jassy said in an email to staff Tuesday that Selipsky’s tenure was always meant to be short-lived. Jassy said that when he left AWS to become Amazon CEO, “we had strong leaders in AWS, several of whom could lead the overall business in the long-term, but who’d benefit from a few more years gaining experience and learning under a more seasoned CEO.” He added that in speaking with Selipsky about taking the job back in 2021, “we agreed that if he accepted the role, he’d likely do it for a few years, and that one of the things he’d focus on during that time was helping prepare the next generation of leadership. We were fortunate that Adam agreed to step in and lead AWS, and has deftly led the business, while also developing his leadership team,” Jassy said. “I’m humbled by the many customers who have said they wouldn’t be what they are without AWS, thankful to our many partners, and grateful to my passionate and innovative teammates. AWS will be in great hands with Matt and the incredible leadership team,” Selipsky said in a post on X Tuesday. Even before Selipsky’s takeover, Garman had been considered by analysts to be among the top frontrunners for AWS CEO.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-services-ceo-step-down-145042873.html,AMZN
Amazon's cloud unit CEO Adam Selipsky to step down,14/5/2024 15:20,Hamza Shaban·Senior ReporterUpdated 14 May 2024 at 8:20 am·3-min read,"The CEO of Amazon's (AMZN) cloud computing business, Adam Selipsky, is stepping down next month, the company announced Tuesday, punctuating a phase of rapid growth at the division and a broader transition in a tech sector that is scrambling to capitalize on the coming AI-led era. Matt Garman, senior vice president of sales and marketing at AWS, will replace Selipsky as CEO effective June 3, the company said. Selipsky's departure comes at a high point for AWS. The cloud services unit is rapidly expanding and has reached a significant milestone of generating a $100 billion run rate. Amazon's broader artificial intelligence strategy runs through AWS, the industry's top cloud service by market share. During the company's most recent earnings report, executives said cloud customers are increasingly signing up for bigger deals with longer commitments, many with generative AI components. Amazon stock was down just under 1% during morning trading. ""Given the state of the business and the leadership team, now is an appropriate moment for me to make this transition, and to take the opportunity to spend more time with family for a while, recharge a bit, and create some mental free space to reflect and consider the possibilities,"" Selipsky said. He took over AWS in 2021. Selipsky, whose three-year tenure was defined by the pandemic, oversaw the business as companies were reeling from the disruptions of the public health crisis and pulled back from spending. But the cloud division has since posted swelling sales growth. Last quarter revenue for AWS came in at $25 billion, beating analyst expectations and increasing about 17% compared to the same period last year. ""I’d like to thank Adam for everything he’s done to lead AWS over the past three years. He took over in the middle of the pandemic, which presented a wide array of leadership and business challenges,"" said Amazon CEO Andy Jassy in a note to employees Tuesday. Garman has worked at Amazon for nearly 18 years, starting as an MBA intern in 2005 and becoming one of the first AWS product managers. He’d go on to serve in the same division as general manager of all AWS compute services and later as the head of sales and marketing. His career tracks the development of AWS, which has grown to become the company’s most profitable unit. That Amazon would appoint an AWS veteran to lead the key division highlights the importance of the role and the pivotal moment for the company. Amazon, which has positioned itself as an AI leader, is among the tech giants racing to claim market share and launch new consumer services, largely based around its major cloud services business. Earlier this year, Amazon increased its investment in the AI startup Anthropic, committing another $2.75 billion to bring its investment total to $4 billion.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/amazons-cloud-unit-ceo-adam-selipsky-to-step-down-144328817.html,AMZN
"Another streaming bundle: Comcast's Peacock to partner with Netflix, Apple TV+",14/5/2024 14:18,Alexandra Canal·Senior Reporter14 May 2024 at 7:18 am·2-min read,"Consumers will soon have access to yet another streaming bundle. Comcast (CMCSA) CEO Brian Roberts said early Tuesday that later this month, the company will launch a new offering that combines its Peacock platform, Netflix (NFLX), and Apple TV+ (AAPL). The new bundle, referred to as StreamSaver, will be available to customers of Comcast’s broadband internet service, the executive revealed at a MoffettNathanson conference. ""Those three products will come at a vastly reduced price to anything in the market today and be available to all our customers,"" Roberts said. Exact pricing details will be announced at a later date. ""We've been bundling video successfully and creatively for 60 years,"" he added. ""This is the latest iteration of that, and I think this will be a pretty compelling package."" The developments come as media companies face pressure from investors to scale their streaming services and achieve profitability. At the same time, the companies are dealing with more competition from tech giants like Amazon (AMZN) and YouTube (GOOGL, GOOG), which are gobbling up streaming deals. On average, US consumers subscribe to four streaming services and spend about $61 per month on them, according to the latest Digital Media Trends report from Deloitte. That means fewer opportunities for streamers to retain loyal subscribers over time. The concept of bundling isn't new. Companies in the space have been doing it with their own services for years. Apple, for instance, offers Apple One, which combines Apple TV+ with other services like Apple Music and Apple Arcade. The bundle launched globally in late 2020. Disney, which has also been offering a bundle with Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+, officially began its domestic rollout of a one-app experience late last year that incorporates Hulu content via Disney+ — a similar play to Paramount's Showtime combination as well as the integration of HBO Max and Discovery+, which both merged their respective services last year. The move toward partnerships among competing media companies, though, has gained traction recently. Just last week, Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) and Disney (DIS) announced a new streaming bundle that will bring together Disney+, Hulu, and Max streaming services, with a launch date set for this summer in the US.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/another-streaming-bundle-comcasts-peacock-to-partner-with-netflix-apple-tv-141828658.html,AMZN

Mag 7 stocks including Apple and Amazon still holding strong,14/5/2024 14:22,"Pedro Goncalves·Finance Reporter, Yahoo Finance UKUpdated 14 May 2024 at 7:22 am·9-min read","The ""Magnificent Seven"" accounted for around two-thirds of the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gains last year, but can they repeat those extraordinary returns this time around? Profits for the ""Mag 7"" are forecast to rise 38% in the first quarter from a year ago, dwarfing the overall S&P 500’s 2.4% anticipated year-over-year earnings growth, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data. This group of mega-cap tech companies — Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) — are capitalising on tech growth trends such as artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing. In 2023, Magnificent Seven stocks surged between 48% and 239%, accounting for some 60% of last year's 24% total return for the S&P 500. Here’s how the mega caps performed this first quarter and what Nvidia is expected to deliver when it reports next week. Tesla reported a 9% drop in first-quarter revenue, the biggest decline since 2012, and missed analysts’ estimates, as the electric vehicle company weathers the effect of ongoing price cuts. The electric vehicle (EV) maker said it had made $1.13bn (£910m) over the first three months of the year, compared with $2.51bn a year earlier.

AMZN or CPNG: Which Is the Better Value Stock Right Now?,13/5/2024 15:40,Zacks Equity Research13 May 2024 at 8:40 am·2-min read,"Investors interested in Internet - Commerce stocks are likely familiar with Amazon (AMZN) and Coupang, Inc. (CPNG). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look. There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits. Amazon has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Coupang, Inc. has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that AMZN is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors. Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels. Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use. AMZN currently has a forward P/E ratio of 41.29, while CPNG has a forward P/E of 66.18. We also note that AMZN has a PEG ratio of 1.39. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. CPNG currently has a PEG ratio of 40.35. Another notable valuation metric for AMZN is its P/B ratio of 9.01. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, CPNG has a P/B of 9.88. These metrics, and several others, help AMZN earn a Value grade of B, while CPNG has been given a Value grade of C. AMZN is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model. And, based on the above valuation metrics, we feel that AMZN is likely the superior value option right now. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

30 Hardest Colleges to Get Into in the US,13/5/2024 14:45,Rabeeta Abbas13 May 2024 at 7:45 am·15-min read,"In this article, we list and discuss the 30 Hardest Colleges to Get Into in the US. If you would like to skip our detailed discussion of the topic, you can go directly to the top 6 Hardest Colleges to Get Into in the US. Quality education undoubtedly sets a person up for success. According to a Fortune500 report, 75% of the world's top 20 CEOs held an MBA or other graduate degree in 2023, 100% of the top 20 held an undergraduate degree, and 11.8% of the top 100 CEOs in the world in 2023 attended undergrad programs from IVY institutes. For context, the IVY League is a group of  8 private universities in the US, renowned worldwide for their history, academic excellence, and exclusivity. It's also interesting to note that although all eight of these institutions are classified among the most prestigious colleges in the world, they do not typically define quality. The quality and worth of an institution can be judged through different metrics like alumni salary, graduation and retention rates, net costs, academic success, etc. However, a low acceptance rate – or exclusivity – does not directly equate to quality. At the same time, the acceptance rate and the measure of quality or economic value of a college are closely linked. That’s because the hardest colleges academically to get into often excel in all the quality metrics and provide a better ROI than inclusive universities. For example, the #1 college in the US by worth is extremely selective, and fresh graduates from this institute can make approximately over $110,000. In comparison, a graduate from any American university with a 100% acceptance rate would make less than half of the same amount. In fact, graduates from top colleges dominated the list of highest-paying bachelor’s degrees as of 2023. Put simply, some of the best colleges in the US which produce the most highly-qualified graduates have high competition and low acceptance rates. Therefore, although exclusivity is not a direct measure of an institute's economic value for students, it is an indirect one. In the US, there is a wide variety of colleges in terms of inclusivity. Some colleges allow everyone to get in, others accept in moderation, and some tend to be extremely selective. Similar to acceptance rate diversity, tuition fees also vary depending on the exclusivity and inclusivity of a college (See: 15 Cheapest American Universities with Low Tuition for International Students). Generally, though, college tuition is costly in the US, with most students having to spend years after graduating trying to pay off their debts. With an average annual tuition fee of $27,091, the US has the highest cost of education in the world. According to the Federal Reserve report, student debt was over $1.7 trillion by the end of 2023. Compared to 2022, this is a decrease of $36.9 billion. However, compared to 2019, the debt grew by $89.3 billion at the end of 2023. The high student debt is a result of the high cost of education in the US, which in turn, affects the accessibility of quality higher education to many individuals in the US. For this reason, some multinational companies like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Allstate Corp (NYSE:ALL), and Baxter International Inc (NYSE:BAX) are making an effort to help their employees pay for college through tuition reimbursement. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has committed to invest a total of $1.2 billion by 2025 in its Career Choice, which is an employees' education and skills training benefits program. In this program, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) offers funding for college tuition, high school diplomas, GEDs, and English as a Second Language (ESL) proficiency certifications for more than 750,000 front-line employees in the US. Through its Career Choice program, the company aims to support its employees in getting over the biggest barriers to education – time and money. Meanwhile, Allstate Corp (NYSE:ALL), an American multinational insurance company, offers to cover up to $5,250 in pre-approved education expenses per calendar year as tuition assistance for its employees. The coverage includes tuition, course fees, textbooks, registration fees, lab fees, and any cost related to the job or career path-related course. Allstate Corp (NYSE:ALL) also offers tuition-free professional certificate and boot camp programs through its Guild Education plan. On the other hand, Baxter International Inc (NYSE:BAX), an American multinational healthcare corporation, supports education by offering scholarships for undergraduate studies. The scholarships are on a merit basis and only available for children of Baxter International Inc.’s (NYSE:BAX) employees.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/30-hardest-colleges-us-144520753.html,AMZN
"Why ""Sell in May?"" Instead, Buy These 5 Growth Stocks Now",13/5/2024 12:08,Tirthankar Chakraborty13 May 2024 at 5:08 am·4-min read,"Wall Street’s age-old adage “sell in May and go away” highlights that the summer months between May and October is the worst period for investors to put money in the stock market. Especially after an outstanding winter, it’s hard to digest that there won't be any profit-taking in the weaker summer months. But astute investors shouldn’t completely unload stocks because of seasonal trends. This is because 2024 is a presidential election year, and stocks tend to perform better in the months leading up to the election compared to nonelection years. By the way, the stock market has already defied the sell-in-May trend, with all the major indexes trading in the positive territory for the month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average scaled upward for the eighth successive trading session on May 10 and registered its best week since December. The 30-stock index posted a fourth consecutive winning week and is now tantalizingly close to the coveted 40,000 mark. The broader S&P 500 and the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite also recorded their third positive week (read more: Dow's 40,000 on the Way: 3 Blue Chip Stocks to Buy Now). The stock market, in reality, is well-poised to gain traction as the Federal Reserve has ruled out any interest rate hike in the upcoming policy meetings. To top it, despite sticky inflation, the cooling of the labor market raised hopes of interest rate cuts soon. New job additions were the lowest in April since November and the unemployment rate is hovering near the 4% mark. Wage growth, on the other hand, declined to its lowest level in April in three years. Thus, consumers’ intent to spend will decline amid fewer jobs and weaker wage growth, which should curb price pressures. The Fed, in turn, will be compelled to trim interest rates. This will lead to a decline in the cost of borrowing and boost consumer outlays. Hence, with the economy well-positioned to chug along and the stock market set to defy discouraging seasonal factors, investors should place bets on fundamentally sound growth stocks such as Agnico Eagle Mines Limited AEM, Abercrombie & Fitch Co. ANF, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL and Hess Corporation HES for solid returns. These stocks carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a Growth Score of A or B, a combination that offers the best opportunities in the growth investing space. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 stocks here. Agnico Eagle Mines is a gold producer having exploration activities in Canada, Europe, Latin America and the United States. Agnico Eagle Mines presently has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of B. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 39.7% over the past 60 days.

Top 3 Blue-Chip Picks as Dow Posts an Eight-Day Winning Run,13/5/2024 12:07,Nalak Das13 May 2024 at 5:07 am·4-min read,"U.S. stock markets regained momentum in May after a disappointing April. The 15-month impressive bull run of Wall Street ended last month. The Dow, despite participating in the bull run, always a lagged to its peers — the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite. However, things have taken a different turn in May. Month to date, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite are up 3.7% and 5%, respectively. The Dow is also up 4.5% in the same period. On May 10, the Dow — popularly known as Wall Street’s blue-chip index — posted an eight-day winning streak, for the first time since Dec 15, 2023. For the week ended May 10, the Dow gained 2.25, marking its best week so far this year and the fourth positive week in a row. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite both posted the third consecutive winning week, rising 1.9% and 1.2%, respectively. The Dow recorded its all-time high of 39,889.05 on an intraday basis on Mar 21 and 39,807.37 on a closing basis on Mar 28. Technically, at its current level of 39,512.84, the Dow is well above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages of 38,748.71 and 36,503.03, respectively. The 50-day moving average line is generally recognized as a short-term trendsetter in financial literature, while the 200-day moving average is considered a long-term trendsetter. Historically it has been noticed in the technical analysis space that whenever the 50-day moving average line surges ahead of the 200-day moving average line, a long-term uptrend for the asset (in this case the Dow Index) becomes a strong possibility. On Feb 26, the restructuring of the 30-stock index resulted in the exit of medical retailer Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (WBA) and the entry of the e-commerce super giant Amazon.com Inc. AMZN. The inclusion of Amazon is seen as a strategic move to increase the blue-chip index’s exposure to new-economy stocks. Broadly, Amazon is categorized as a consumer discretionary company. However, its massive adoption of high-end technologies compelled a large section of financial analysts to categorize it as a technology bigwig. Amazon’s entry will significantly increase the exposure of the blue-chip index in the e-commerce, consumer retail and technology space. We have narrowed our search to three Dow stocks that have strong earnings growth potential for 2024. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Amgen AMGN, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, Apple Inc. AAPL, Boeing BA and The Goldman Sachs Group GS. The Dow Jones Industrial Average emerged stronger than the other two major indices in the latest market rally, driven by renewed hopes of rate cuts, solid corporate earnings and increased stock buybacks. The blue-chip index gained for seven consecutive days, marking its longest winning streak this year. While 27 of the 30 members of the Dow Jones Index have performed well over the last seven days, we have highlighted five of them that have been leading the way higher. These are Amgen, Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Boeing and The Goldman Sachs Group. The outperformance came as the market’s rally broadened out. If this trend lasts, the Dow could continue its upward trajectory this summer. The reconstruction of the blue-chip index is finally paying off. Amazon, which joined the index on Feb 26, provided a boost to the index after it reported blockbuster first-quarter 2024 results. The e-commerce giant beat both earnings and revenue estimates driven by growth in its advertising and AI-powered cloud computing units. The blue-chip index also benefited from Apple’s robust second-quarter fiscal 2024 results. The iPhone manufacturer spread strong optimism after lifting its dividend payments and announcing a record share buyback program amid the steep decline in iPhone sales. Another big mover in the index is Amgen, which surged more than 14% last week on a solid earnings report and encouraging test results of its injectable weight-loss drug MariTide. Bank stocks and small-cap stocks also showed an upward trend in recent sessions, powering the blue-chip index. Further, the index appears unaffected compared with the other two major indices, which cooled down somewhat in the recent sessions following the latest Fed official comments that higher rates will likely stay for some time. Amgen is one of the biggest biotech companies in the world, with a strong presence in the oncology/hematology, cardiovascular disease, neuroscience, inflammation, bone health, nephrology and neuroscience markets. The stock has risen 14.5% so far this month. Amgen saw a positive earnings estimate revision of 3 cents over the past seven days for this year and has an expected earnings growth rate of 4.3%.

"Walmart, Target, Home Depot and Amazon are part of Zacks Earnings Preview",13/5/2024 10:27,Zacks Equity Research13 May 2024 at 3:27 am·8-min read,"Chicago, IL – May 13, 2024 – Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week’s list includes Walmart WMT, Target TGT, Home Depot HD and Amazon AMZN. Walmart shares held their own in last month’s market weakness, cementing its anchoring and defensive positioning, particularly relative to Target and Home Depot. From the market’s March 28th peak through the end of April 2024, the S&P 500 index lost -3.8% of its value, while Walmart was down only -1.4%. Target lost -9.2% of its value during that same period, while Home Depot shares were down -12.9%. Walmart’s defensive attributes reflect the retailer’s heavy grocery exposure and reputation for value. Walmart’s value orientation and well-executed digital strategy have been key to gaining grocery market share by attracting higher-income households. Walmart’s growing share of higher-income grocery spending notwithstanding, the retailer still has a substantial exposure to lower-income consumers, who appear to be under increasing stress, as reflected in rising loan delinquency rates and other measures indicating strained financial health. This exposure could be a source of vulnerability for Walmart’s same-store sales in its quarterly release on Thursday, May 16th; Target reports the following week on May 22nd. Walmart is expected to report $0.52 in EPS on $159.2 billion in revenues, representing year-over-year changes of +6.1% and +4.5%, respectively. Trends in Walmart’s non-grocery business have been anemic lately, so any favorable turn in the demand trends for this relatively discretionary merchandise will be a nice offset to the aforementioned lower-income vulnerability. Any signs of life on the discretionary merchandise part will also have positive read-throughs for Target and Home Depot. Home Depot reports on Tuesday, May 14th. Target shares were up big following each of the preceding two reports, which assured investors about management’s ability on the margins and the ‘shrinkage issue’ they appeared to be struggling with over the last couple of years.

TV upfront presentations clouded by digital video ad supremacy,13/5/2024 10:03,Dawn Chmielewski and Sheila Dang13 May 2024 at 3:03 am·3-min read,"By Dawn Chmielewski and Sheila Dang (Reuters) - As television executives prepare lavish stage presentations in New York this week to dazzle advertisers during the annual TV upfront sales season, a harsh economic reality looms offstage -- digital video advertising now eclipses spending on traditional television ads. The shift in spending and competition from tech players like Amazon has taken a toll on media companies' financial results, raising the stakes for the annual showcase of TV content to attract spending commitments from advertisers. “We’ve definitely seen that audience erosion in linear TV in certain pockets -- especially more so in entertainment,” said Nicole McCurnin, director of advertising insights at ad tracking firm Guideline. “But I do see, broad strokes, ad companies’ attention is just going more so towards those digital platforms.” Digital video refers to a broad category of TV alternatives that includes paid streaming services like Netflix, social video platforms such as TikTok, free ad-supported TV offerings like Pluto TV and cable replacement services including YouTube TV. It will account for an estimated $62.9 billion in U.S. ad spending in 2024, according to an April report from the Interactive Advertising Bureau and Guideline. That represents 52% of the projected spending on video advertising this year, reflecting a change in viewing habits nearly two decades in the making. Walt Disney, Warner Bros Discovery, Fox and Comcast's NBCUniversal all reported declines in domestic television ad revenue in the most recent quarter, though NBCU's exclusive streaming of an NFL Wild Card game on its Peacock service helped fuel revenue, offsetting those declines. Many of the streaming services launched to capitalize on changing consumer viewing behavior ""are still bleeding cash while declines in the traditional television business accelerate,"" said Richard Greenfield, media analyst at LightShed Partners. ""They simply pivoted too late."" The fragmenting of the video landscape is well understood -- and media companies like NBCUniversal have developed new advertising tools that let marketers' messages ride along with their content, wherever it appears. For example, a T-Mobile ad featuring U.S. TV show ""Saturday Night Live's"" Chloe Fineman could air during the live network TV broadcast of “SNL,” appear the next day on NBCU’s Peacock streaming service and show up on social platforms like X, TikTok and YouTube. “Regardless of where that person is who's in your target … you can go follow them, wherever they are,” NBCUniversal global advertising chairman Mark Marshall told Reuters. “The technology and capability just wasn't available until this year.”",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/tv-upfront-presentations-clouded-digital-100351502.html,AMZN

25 Careers with the Most Job Security in the US,12/5/2024 14:23,Afifa Mushtaque12 May 2024 at 7:23 am·11-min read,"In this article, we will look at the 25 careers with the most job security in the US. We have also talked about growing concerns about job insecurity due to AI. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 10 Careers with the Most Job Security in the US. According to a study conducted by Authority Hacker, with a sample of 1200 full-time workers, job insecurity looms large over the American workforce as over half of full-time employees express growing concerns. Strikingly, the tech industry which is largely believed to be synonymous with innovation, is witnessing an increase in anxiety, attributed to recurrent mass layoffs and the specter of AI replacing human roles. According to the survey, men exhibit a higher propensity for job insecurity compared to women, with those earning $150,000 or more exhibiting the highest concern. Moreover, professions most vulnerable to AI disruption such as IT, software development, and advertising, report the most severe cases of anxieties. It is also interesting to note that one of the most vulnerable jobs to AI are that of customer service representatives which are also known to have the most oversaturated jobs. Apart from concerns of job insecurity due to AI, job insecurity has been a persistent concern, especially during economic downturns in the US. Despite claims that recessions have become less common over time, skepticism remains due to historical data discrepancies. According to Business Insider, between 1990 and 2023, the US experienced 36 months of recession, compared to 59 months between 1960 and 1989. However, the reliability of recession data before 1950 is questionable which potentially skewes perceptions of historical recession frequency. Speaking of economic downturns, in April 2024, the US observed a major slowdown in job growth as employers only added 175,000 positions. This trend was accompanied by a rise in the unemployment rate from 3.8% to 3.9%, according to the Labor Department. The Federal Reserve's decision to increase interest rates since 2022 also aimed to temper economic expansion and alleviate inflationary pressures. However, with inflation remaining above the bank's 2% target at 3.5% in March, there were doubts about the timing of further rate cuts. Nonetheless, the unexpected slowdown in job growth in April raised expectations for potential rate adjustments later in the year. Despite the tempered job growth, some sectors like healthcare, continued to drive employment gains. Average hourly earnings rose by 3.9% over the 12 months to April, albeit at a slower pace compared to the previous month. Now that we are talking about job gains, it is worth highlighting that Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is set to construct an $800 million data center spanning 715,000 square feet in Montgomery, Alabama. This data center is anticipated to generate 100 job opportunities. Located near the Interstate 65 and Hyundai's automotive assembly plant, the site was announced by Governor Kay Ivey at Montgomery Whitewater and is slated for completion by 2026. Over 1,000 construction workers are expected to be engaged at the peak of its construction. This is one of the most significant investments by Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) in Alabama, following the establishment of its first data center campus in Huntsville in 2021, which currently employs approximately 300 individuals. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)’s total investment in the state amounts to $1.5 billion. Montgomery will become home to Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)’s 24th data hub and its 20th in the United States. The city was selected owing to its accessibility to infrastructure, renewable energy availability, and a rich pool of talent. Once operational, the facility is slated to achieve LEED Gold certification, utilize 100% renewable energy, and attain net-zero emissions. On the other hand, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services (AWS) has announced a monumental investment of $11 billion in Indiana which is expected to generate a minimum of 1,000 job opportunities. With the backing of Governor Eric Holcomb and the Indiana Economic Development Corporation (IEDC), Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) will establish new data centers in St. Joseph County to fortify infrastructure and economic growth in the region. Since 2010, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has invested $21.5 billion in Indiana and hence, has contributed largely to the state's gross domestic product and created over 26,000 full- and part-time positions.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/25-careers-most-job-security-142337504.html,AMZN

"With 62% institutional ownership, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a favorite amongst the big guns",12/5/2024 11:00,editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St)12 May 2024 at 4:00 am·4-min read,"Significantly high institutional ownership implies Amazon.com's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions A total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 46% ownership  Insider ownership in Amazon.com is 11% To get a sense of who is truly in control of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 62% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk). Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Amazon.com, beginning with the chart below.  View our latest analysis for Amazon.com  Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing. We can see that Amazon.com does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Amazon.com's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Amazon.com is not owned by hedge funds. Because actions speak louder than words, we consider it a good sign when insiders own a significant stake in a company. In Amazon.com's case, its Top Key Executive, Jeffrey Bezos, is the largest shareholder, holding 9.0% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.4% and 6.0% of the stock.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/62-institutional-ownership-amazon-com-110021152.html,AMZN
12 Best Marketing Stocks to Buy,10/5/2024 23:39,Affan Mir10 May 2024 at 4:39 pm·16-min read,"In this article, we discuss the 12 best marketing stocks to buy. To skip the detailed analysis of the industry, go directly to the 5 Best Marketing Stocks to Buy. The advertising and marketing industry is a vital component of the economy and it plays diverse roles in driving growth, nurturing innovation and creativity, and facilitating market efficiency. According to a report by Solomon Partners, the projections indicate that global advertising growth for 2024 is expected to range from 4.6% to 7.2%, nearly doubling the anticipated growth rate of 2% to 5% projected for 2023. Some of the major growth catalysts in the year for marketing and advertising companies are the Paris Olympics and the US elections. According to the report, the highest ad spending year-over-year growth is expected for out-of-home advertising at 7.2%, followed by digital ad spending at 6.3%. On the other hand, print ad spending is expected to decline by 4.6% year-over-year. In recent weeks, companies with digital advertisement segments saw a healthy rise in their ad revenues. Mega-cap tech stocks such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) beat their estimates and experienced a significant rise in their advertisement businesses. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) reported its earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, on April 24, posting an EPS of $4.71, up $0.39 from forecasts. The company’s revenue was up 27% year-over-year at $36.46 billion, ahead of estimates by $240 million. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) reported that the number of ad impressions delivered across its Family of Apps increased by 20%, compared to the previous year and the average price per ad was up 6% year-over-year. Nearly 98% of the company’s revenue comes from advertisements. At its Q1 2024 earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg made the following comments about integrating AI with its ad business: “...once our new AI services reach scale, we have a strong track record of monetizing them effectively. There are several ways to build a massive business here, including scaling business messaging, introducing ads or paid content into AI interactions, and enabling people to pay to use bigger AI models and access more compute. And on top of those, AI is already helping us improve app engagement which naturally leads to seeing more ads, and improving ads directly to deliver more value. So if the technology and products evolve in the way that we hope, each of those will unlock massive amounts of value for people and business for us over time.” Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) posted its earnings for the fiscal first quarter of 2024 on April 25 and reported an EPS of $1.89, exceeding EPS estimates by $0.38. The company's revenue was up 15.4% year-over-year at $80.54 billion. The company’s Google advertising segment reported revenues of $61.66 billion, showing an increase of over 13% year-over-year. Furthermore, YouTube ads generated a revenue of $8.09 billion, compared to $6.693 billion in the first quarter of 2023. Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) CEO, Sundar Pichai made the following comments at the company’s Q1 2024 earnings call: “We remain committed to all of this work. Finally, our monetization path. We have clear paths to AI monetization through ads and cloud, as well as subscriptions. Philip will talk more about new AI features that are helping advertisers, including bringing Gemini models into Performance Max. Our Cloud business continues to grow as we bring the best of Google AI to enterprise customers and organizations around the world. And Google One now has crossed 100 million paid subscribers. And in Q1, we introduced a new AI premium plan with Gemini Advanced. Okay, those are the six points. So now let me turn to quarterly highlights from Cloud and YouTube in a bit more detail. In Cloud, we have announced more than 1,000 new products and features over the past eight months.” While the above-mentioned companies generate most of their revenues from advertising and marketing, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is an e-commerce company. However, its ad revenue experienced the most noteworthy jump. On April 30, the company reported earnings for the fiscal first quarter of 2024. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) reported an EPS of $1.13 and beat EPS expectations by $0.30. The company's revenue surged by 12.5% year-over-year to $143.3 billion and beat Wall Street consensus by $763.92 million. The company’s advertising business brought in a revenue of $11.8 billion, up 24% year-over-year. Here is what Amazon.com, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) CEO, Andy Jassy said about its advertising business at the company’s Q1 2024 earnings call: “The strength in advertising was primarily driven by sponsored products, supported by continued improvements in relevancy and measurement capabilities for advertisers. We still see significant opportunity ahead in our sponsored products as well as areas where we’re just getting started like Prime Video ads. Prime Video ads offers brands value as we can better link the impact of streaming TV advertising to business outcomes like product sales or subscription sign-ups, whether the brands sell on Amazon or not. It’s very early for streaming TV ads but we’re encouraged by the early response. Moving to AWS. Year-over-year revenue growth accelerated to 17.2% in Q1, up from 13.2% in Q4. It’s useful to remember that year-over-year percentages are only relevant relative to the total base from which you start.” On February 28, Barclays highlighted Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) strategic focus on advertising investments and emphasized their significance in light of ongoing antitrust actions in the US and Europe, as well as the evolving landscape influenced by artificial intelligence, as reported by TheFly. The firm believes that the company’s advertising assets could potentially reach a value of $50 billion over time and can challenge Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in the advertisement segment. Barclays estimates the intrinsic worth of Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) advertising segment at $30 billion, largely propelled by platforms like LinkedIn and Bing, and anticipates a potential $20 billion surge in sales through aggressive distribution strategies. Barclays has a Buy rating on Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares with a $475 price target.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/12-best-marketing-stocks-buy-233954725.html,AMZN

"Reddit is maturing as a company, CEO says",9/5/2024 18:28,Brian Sozzi·Executive Editor9 May 2024 at 11:28 am·3-min read,"Reddit (RDDT) is entering its adult years, and that may turn out well for investors. ""A lot of things are really starting to click,"" Reddit co-founder and CEO Steve Huffman told Yahoo Finance on Thursday (video above). The company this week reported its first results since going public in late March — and there was much to prove the bears wrong. Daily active users increased 37% year over year to 82.7 million. Weekly active unique users rose 40% from the prior year. Total revenue improved 48% to $243 million, nearly doubling the growth rate from the prior quarter, due to strength in advertising. The company delivered adjusted operating profits of $10 million, versus a $50.2 million loss a year ago. Huffman declined to say when the company would be profitable on a net income basis, noting it's a focus for the management team. Other areas of focus include rolling out a new user interface this year, introducing shopping capabilities, and searching for another artificial intelligence content licensing deal like the one with Google (GOOG, GOOGL). ""Results this quarter show that Reddit is on the early end of a number of positive inflections: Top-of-funnel growth is accelerating, the ad platform is in the early stages of being built to address lower funnel objectives, the data licensing business is in the very early stages of growth, and the company is entering a harvest period in costs after aggressively adding to headcount over the last couple years,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Benjamin Black said in a client note. For Reddit, the quarter was another win for 2024. Initially expected to price its IPO in the $31 to $34 per share range, Reddit ended up pricing its IPO at $34 in late March, giving it a $6.4 billion valuation. The targeted valuation on a fully diluted basis was less than the $10 billion it fetched in a 2021 funding round.

3 Reasons Growth Investors Will Love Amazon (AMZN),9/5/2024 16:45,Zacks Equity Research9 May 2024 at 9:45 am·3-min read,"Growth stocks are attractive to many investors, as above-average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task. That's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss. However, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects. Amazon (AMZN) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank. Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better. Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this online retailer a great growth pick right now. Earnings Growth Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration. While the historical EPS growth rate for Amazon is 10.5%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 56.6% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 22.4%.

This is the Amazon everyone should have feared,9/5/2024 16:16,Jason Del Rey9 May 2024 at 9:16 am·3-min read,"A little less than six years ago, I wrote an article with a similar headline to this newsletter. At the time, Amazon had once again posted its largest quarterly profit in history—$2.5 billion at the time—on the back of its two fastest-growing businesses that hadn’t even existed when Jeff Bezos took the company public: Amazon Web Services and Amazon Advertising. “An Amazon that is posting growing profits from its non-core business,” I wrote back in 2018, “means an Amazon that can continue to keep prices low and invest in ever-speedier delivery times to widen its defensive moat in its main retail business. That should be a very scary realization for rivals.” And it mostly has been. Fast forward to last week, when Amazon announced its financial results for the first quarter of 2024. Amazon’s net income surpassed $10 billion for the quarter and would have exceeded $12 billion if not for a $2 billion non-cash expense from its investment in the electric carmaker Rivian. On the revenue side, its year-over-year growth rates accelerated across the board, for its AWS, advertising, and core e-commerce divisions, respectively. That’s a revenue acceleration even as AWS is on track to surpass $100 billion in annual sales by the end of 2024, while its investments in what could be a transformational technology of generative AI are just ramping up. The law of large numbers doesn’t seem to be holding AWS back. Meanwhile, Amazon’s ad business should top $50 billion for the first time in 2024, and that’s with the tech giant just starting to really court TV advertisers to buy ads on Prime Video, thanks to its deal to stream NFL games—and, soon, NBA basketball games too. Over the decade-plus that I’ve covered this company, it’s become common for stock analysts to ask Amazon officials on earnings calls whether the company is currently operating in more of an investing cycle than a profits one, or vice versa. And on last week’s earnings call, an analyst posed such a question once again. But the answer was much different than ever before. “I think we're in a position to do both is the short answer,” Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said on the call. “I think there's actually an opportunity in our existing large businesses—in the stores business along with advertising and AWS—there's a lot of growth in front of us. And I think we're investing in a meaningful way. But I think…we don't believe that we're at the end of what we can do in terms of improving our cost structure on the store side.” For the first time in a very long time—maybe in the company’s 30-year history—Amazon is at a point where it can afford “to do both.” That’s noteworthy. To be clear, the company is facing myriad challenges, including some self-induced. Its plans to reinvent brick-and-mortar shopping through technology haven’t gone as planned. The Federal Trade Commission’s antitrust lawsuit against Amazon, however unlikely, could someday force the company to overhaul its business or even split it into parts. Amazon’s relationship with the hundreds of thousands of sellers who account for 60% of the company’s product sales has probably never been worse no matter what Amazon’s CEO says. And as the nascent generative AI sector has boomed, Amazon has found itself in some instances trailing competitors.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-everyone-feared-161644951.html,AMZN
Are You Looking for a Top Momentum Pick? Why Amazon (AMZN) is a Great Choice,9/5/2024 16:00,Zacks Equity Research9 May 2024 at 9:00 am·4-min read,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades. Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us. Below, we take a look at Amazon (AMZN), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score. It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Amazon currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period. You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>> Set to Beat the Market? Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for AMZN that show why this online retailer shows promise as a solid momentum pick. A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area. For AMZN, shares are up 3.67% over the past week while the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry is up 1.77% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 1.1% compares favorably with the industry's 0.55% performance as well. While any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Shares of Amazon have increased 9.95% over the past quarter, and have gained 70.61% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 4.14% and 27.07%, respectively.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/looking-top-momentum-pick-why-160011652.html,AMZN

Fail Your Way to Financial Success: 15 Lessons From Jeff Bezos,9/5/2024 14:00,Jennifer Taylor9 May 2024 at 7:00 am·13-min read,"In 1994, Jeff Bezos co-founded the future e-commerce behemoth Amazon in a Seattle garage. Previously employed by a Wall Street hedge fund, he quit his job to try his hand at building an online business before most people even knew what the internet was. In an interview with Time magazine, the Amazon CEO revealed he gave himself a 30% chance that Amazon would succeed. “That’s actually a very liberating expectation, expecting to fail,” Bezos said. Now one of the richest people on any continent, Bezos was the first person to obtain a net worth surpassing $150 billion in the 30 years Forbes has been tracking the richest Americans. His fortune is estimated at over $200 billion as of April 3, 2024, according to Forbes. Amazon’s market capitalization is $1.96 trillion, as of May 2024.

"Dow's 40,000 on the Way: 3 Blue Chip Stocks to Buy Now",9/5/2024 12:32,Tirthankar Chakraborty9 May 2024 at 5:32 am·3-min read,"After witnessing a noteworthy December, the Dow continued its advances this year. The 30-stock blue-chip index closed higher in the last six trading sessions, its longest winning streak since the period ending on Dec 19, when the index notched an astounding nine-day winning streak. The Dow is currently trading above the 39,000 threshold, with market participants eagerly waiting for the index to surpass the 40,000-point mark. However, the blue-chip index time and again found it problematic to cross a multi-zero barrier. Eclipsing the 40,000 barrier remained an uphill task due to the pandemic, elevated interest rates and relentless volatility among high-flying tech stocks. But fortunately, things are looking up at the moment. A “Goldilocks” economic circumstance is expected to take the heat off price pressures and compel the Federal Reserve to ease its monetary policy this year. The U.S. economy added 175,000 new jobs in April, the smallest increase in hiring since September, and way less than analysts’ prediction of 240,000 new job additions. At the same time, the jobless rate ticked up to 3.9% from 3.8% and is now tantalizingly close to the 4% mark. In contrast, the uptick in wages over the past 12 months slowed to 3.9% in April from 4.1% in the prior month, the lowest level in three years. With fewer jobs and a decline in pay, consumers’ tendency to spend will decline and eventually curb inflationary pressure. This, in turn, will compel the Fed to cut interest rates. Fed Chair Jerome Powell, by the way, has ruled out any interest rate hike in its upcoming policy meetings. Needless to say, interest rate cuts boost consumer outlays, and curtail borrowing costs, leading to economic growth and helping the stock market scale northward. Hence, the odds of the Dow blowing past the 40,000 mark seem just a matter of time. Amid such optimism, it’s judicious for astute investors to invest in fundamentally solid blue-chip stocks such as Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. GS and Salesforce, Inc. CRM that are well-poised to take advantage of the Dow’s uptrend. Being blue-chip stocks, they have sturdy balance sheets, steady cash inflows and large market capitalization. They currently have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here. Amazon is one of the largest e-commerce providers, with sprawling operations in North America, now spreading across the globe.

Apple’s iPad event was an AI teaser for its future,9/5/2024 9:22,Daniel Howley·Technology Editor9 May 2024 at 2:22 am·3-min read,"Apple’s (AAPL) artificial intelligence push has begun. On Tuesday, the company unveiled its latest iPad Pros, which pack an all-new M4 processor. The chip provides the Pro with a number of benefits including a faster CPU and updated graphics processing unit. But it was Apple’s focus on the M4’s AI capabilities that stood out the most. Apple has been putting its neural engine into processors since 2017 and has previously talked up how it helps power a number of iPhone, iPad, and Mac features for some time. But the M4 unveiling was different, serving as an appetizer for the AI features the company will present at its WWDC event in June, when Apple is widely expected to debut a slew of generative AI-powered software features for its various devices. Apple pointed to a number of the M4’s AI bona fides during the keynote, with vice president of platform architecture Tim Millet specifically noting that the chip is capable of 34 trillion operations per second, a measurement commonly used when describing a chip’s AI performance. Millet also said that the M4’s neural engine is more powerful than any neural processing unit in any AI PC. That’s a direct shot at Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), and Qualcomm (QCOM), which are preparing to or are already rolling out their own AI PC chips designed to run large language models on Windows laptops and desktops. Outside of the M4’s AI processing fundamentals, Apple was mum on any substantive discussion of AI software updates. Sure, Millet said that the M4 helps the iPad Pro quickly isolate a subject from its background in a 4K video, but the M2-equipped iPad Air can do the same thing, just a bit slower. All the company had to offer was that the M4 would make AI apps and features run faster and more smoothly. The company also didn’t provide information about the M4’s performance while training or running large language models (LLMs), something that Intel, Qualcomm, and AMD regularly point to as indicators of their chips’ strengths. Still, the fact that Apple gave consumers, and Wall Street, an early look at its AI thinking is important. The company is widely viewed as behind the curve when it comes to the generative AI race, and investors are banking heavily on WWDC serving as Apple’s big AI coming-out party. CEO Tim Cook has been steadily mentioning AI more over the past few months and said during the company’s most recent earnings call that the iPhone maker is investing heavily in the technology.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/apples-ipad-event-was-an-ai-teaser-for-its-future-184058075.html,AMZN

"Fraud rife on secondhand marketplaces Depop, Preloved, and Shpock",9/5/2024 4:00,Zoe Wood8 May 2024 at 9:00 pm·3-min read,"Consumers have been encouraged to be vigilant when shopping online after research showed fraud was rife on secondhand marketplaces, with Depop, Shpock and Preloved named the worst sites, and problems also discovered with industry giants Amazon and eBay. A survey of 1,300 buyers by Which?, the consumer champion, found that 32% had been scammed on a secondhand marketplace in the two years to January. The most common ruse involved consumers receiving incorrect goods or nothing at all, while others were delivered an empty package or counterfeit goods. The survey comes as an international investigation by the Guardian, Die Zeit and Le Monde shines a light on the scale of authorised push payment (APP) fraud, where victims are duped into making online transfers to a fraudster. It revealed how a vast web of fake shops touting designer brands took money and personal details from consumers who received no items. Purchase scams are the most common form of APP fraud. In the first six months of 2023 alone there were 77,000 cases, equivalent to 66% of the total, reported to banks with £41m lost, according to UK Finance figures. Buyers were most likely to be scammed on Depop, the study found, with 57% telling Which? they had experienced a scam on the site. This compares with 53% for Shpock and 51% for Preloved and Nextdoor. The figure for Amazon Marketplace was 35%, while for Gumtree and eBay it was 29%. The number for Facebook and Vinted was 24% and 22%, respectively. Rocio Concha, Which? director of policy and advocacy, said that, while buying secondhand can save money, the survey’s findings were “worrying”. “It’s important that people properly check the seller’s reviews and profile,” she said, adding that marketplaces need to have proper checks in place and ensure that scam profiles are removed quickly. However, fraud is not a one-sided affair. Which? questioned 1,400 sellers and 22% of them reported being scammed over the same two-year period. They were most likely to encounter potential fraudsters on Nextdoor, at 39%, followed by 26% for Preloved and Shpock, and Depop on 23%. The figure sat at about 20% for Amazon Marketplace, Facebook and eBay, while on Gumtree and Vinted it was 16% and 11%, respectively. In response to the report, Depop said it offered protection for buyers and sellers and was investing in new technology. “We strongly encourage consumers who are buying and selling anywhere online never to share personal information with other users, to be very wary about following links to other sites, and to report any suspicious behaviour via in-app reporting systems.” Vinted said that, as customer-to-customer online platforms become more popular, the “risk of these platforms being targeted by scammers also increases”. Its security measures are regularly checked and improved upon and new tools for secure transactions on the platform are always in development, it said.

Rivian reports mixed Q1 results but trims capex forecast and sees Q4 'gross profit',8/5/2024 20:46,Pras Subramanian·Senior Reporter8 May 2024 at 1:46 pm·3-min read,"Rivian (RIVN) reported mixed quarterly results for the first quarter but will see further cost savings from shifting its upcoming R2 production to its Normal, Ill., plant and trimming its capital expenditure forecast. The EV maker also reaffirmed its full-year loss forecast and still sees a ""path"" to ""modest gross profit"" in the fourth quarter of this year. For the quarter, Rivian reported revenue of $1.20 billion versus $1.17 billion expected, which is an 80% jump from a year ago. However, Rivian posted a loss per share of $1.48 versus $1.27 estimated, with an operating loss of $1.484 billion compared to the $1.299 billion loss expected. Rivian reaffirmed its adjusted EBITDA loss forecast of $2.7 billion for 2024 but now sees its capital expenditure outlays improving to $1.2 billion from $1.75 billion seen earlier. This is due to the company moving the start of R2 production to its Normal, Ill., plant, and further savings expected in 2025 and 2026. Rivian stock slipped 5% in early trade, but shares rallied late in the trading session and finished flat for the day. ""We hit several milestones this quarter, including producing our 100,000th vehicle in Normal, successfully navigating the retooling upgrade, and unveiling our new midsize platform, which underpins the R2, R3, and R3X,"" CEO RJ Scaringe said in a statement. The company also said that as a result of its retooling upgrade and other improvements, Rivian remains ""confident in its path to achieving modest gross profit in the fourth quarter of this year."" By shifting R2 production to its existing US factory instead of its upcoming Georgia factory, Rivian said on Tuesday the company will save more than $2.25 billion. Following the R2 launch and plant changes, the company now expects its Normal plant to hit 215,000 units of total annual capacity across all vehicles, which includes up to 155,000 units of the R2. In terms of its cash cushion, Rivian said it had $5.98 billion at the end of Q1 versus $7.86 billion at the end of Q4. Last month, the company reported first quarter R1T and R1S production of 13,980 and deliveries of 13,588, topping expectations of around 12,400 units. The company also reaffirmed production guidance of 57,000 vehicles in 2024. Part of bringing down those costs came in the form of a 10% salaried staff reduction, with the company citing economic uncertainty.

"Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Hit a 52 Week High, Can the Run Continue?",8/5/2024 13:15,Zacks Equity Research8 May 2024 at 6:15 am·4-min read,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Amazon (AMZN)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 1.7% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $189.94 in the previous session. Amazon has gained 24.2% since the start of the year compared to the 10.1% move for the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector and the 17.6% return for the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry. What's Driving the Outperformance? The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on April 30, 2024, Amazon reported EPS of $1.13 versus consensus estimate of $0.83 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 0.55%. For the current fiscal year, Amazon is expected to post earnings of $4.54 per share on $638.26 billion in revenues. This represents a 56.55% change in EPS on a 11.04% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $5.77 per share on $709.99 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 27.08% and 11.24%, respectively. Valuation Metrics Amazon may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level. On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style. Amazon has a Value Score of B. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A. In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 41.6X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 20.2X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 25X versus its peer group's average of 14.6X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.4.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple! Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.  View our latest analysis for Amazon.com  We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.

Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Pilgrim's Pride PPC, Enterprise Products Partners EPD, Lancaster Colony Corp. LANC, Amazon.com AMZN and Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd. AEM. Wall Street regained momentum at the start of May on the back of solid corporate earnings and renewed bets for Fed rate cuts. In fact, major indices have risen in the last three days, with the S&P 500 logging its best three-day run of 2024. Meanwhile, Treasury yields wrapped up the last week with the biggest weekly drop in at least three months. Will the rebound continue for the rest of the month, given the weak seasonal trends? After all, the adage “Sell in May and Go Away” says investors should sell their stocks in May and re-enter the market in November to capitalize on the historically strong performance of equities between November and April. It denotes traditional market underperformance during the summer months (May to October). In such a scenario, investors might consider several investment strategies to navigate the May-October period more effectively, which could lead to a winning portfolio. The picture emerging from the first-quarter earnings season continues to be one of steady improvement and resilience, with the earnings growth pace modestly accelerating and estimates for the coming periods starting to increase. Total earnings of the 310 S&P 500 members that have reported results are up 5% from the same period last year on 4.5% higher revenues, with 78.1% beating EPS estimates and 59.4% beating revenue estimates. A softer-than-expected jobs report revived bets for an earlier rate cut from the Federal Reserve. The United States added a lower-than-expected 175,000 jobs last month, and the unemployment rate unexpectedly jumped to 3.9%. After growing for 15 consecutive months, U.S. service sector activity also unexpectedly contracted in April. The futures market is now pricing in at least two interest rate cuts by the end of the year. Traders are now wagering that the central bank will begin trimming rates as soon as September but still maintained only around a 44% probability of such a scenario, according to the CME Fedwatch tool. In another recent weak data, consumer confidence dopped last month to the lowest since mid-2022. Additionally, the world's biggest economy had a weak start to the year due to lower consumer and government spending amid growing inflation. The economy expanded at the slowest pace in two years, with GDP rising 1.6% annually in the first quarter. While the weak data has pushed up bets for sooner-than-expected rate cuts lately, the Fed signaled that its fight against inflation will continue for a longer period, setting the stage for a period of extended higher rates. In its latest meeting, the Fed kept interest rates steady at a 23-year high in the range of 5.25% to 5.5%, citing a “lack of further progress” on inflation. Powell reiterated that it will now take longer than expected for the Fed to reach the confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down to 2%. This indicates that rate cuts are not in the cards anytime soon. Volatility and uncertainty are expected to increase as this is a Presidential election year in the United States. But, according to Carson Group data going back to 1950, stocks have historically rallied during the summer in presidential election years. The S&P 500 rose 2.3% on average during the May to October period during election years and was higher 77.8% of the times. Per Schaeffer’s research, the S&P’s average six-month return leading up to a Presidential election in early November is 4.67%, which compares with 2.14% in non-election years and 0.95% in mid-term election years. Rotating the investments in sectors that have historically performed well during the May-October period, such as consumer staples, utilities, and healthcare, could be beneficial. The consumer staples and healthcare sectors have climbed 4.1% on average during the hotter months since 1990, outperforming the broader market’s 2.1% advance, according to CFRA Research.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-analyst-blog-highlights-pilgrims-101100924.html,AMZN

Whole Foods CEO: The chain is investing in value and technology — with help from Amazon,7/5/2024 22:04,Brooke DiPalma·Senior Reporter7 May 2024 at 3:04 pm·3-min read,"Whole Foods is trying to juggle value and quality as cautious consumers hunt for deals in the face of stubborn grocery inflation. ""We've increased the number of promotions for our customers ... as a result, we've actually seen double-digit unit growth in promotional items,"" CEO Jason Buechel told Yahoo Finance at the Milken Institute Global Conference on Tuesday. Believe it or not, it's been seven years since Amazon (AMZN) acquired Whole Foods. Cutting prices to reaccelerate same-store sales growth was a key focus for the Street at the time. Now Buechel is aiming to strike the right balance. Cost of groceries remained flat in March and is up 1.2% year over year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The April read on CPI (Consumer Price Index) is set to come out next week. ""Between commodities, labor, cost — inflation has been real,"" Buechel said. While Whole Foods shoppers, who are traditionally higher-income, are looking for cheaper prices, they aren't willing to compromise on quality, Buechel said. They care about where the product was grown, raised, and produced, which comes at a higher cost, raising a challenge for the company. ""What we need to do is make sure that we can find a point where customers are happy with the value of the product and can appreciate the work that's gone into it. At the same time, [that] our Whole Foods sales and profits [are] growing,"" he said. Whole Foods does not publicly share its results, but Buechel said his team is ""proud"" of recent growth.

Intel's New Venture in Japan: Pioneering Automation in Chip Manufacturing by 2028,7/5/2024 20:36,Anusuya Lahiri7 May 2024 at 1:36 pm·2-min read,"Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) Intel has partnered with 14 Japanese companies, including Omron and Yamaha Motor, to develop automation technologies for back-end semiconductor processes like packaging. Under the leadership of Kunimasa Suzuki, who heads Intel’s operations in Japan, this consortium plans to allocate tens of billions of yen—potentially over 10 billion yen ($65 million)—to achieve operational technology by 2028. The focus is to enhance the traditionally labor-intensive back-end steps, such as chip stacking, which are crucial as front-end techniques like circuit formation approach their physical limitations, Nikkei Asia reports. This strategic move aims to mitigate geopolitical risks in the U.S. and Japan’s semiconductor supply chains by transitioning back-end production tasks, usually performed in labor-rich countries like China and Southeast Asia, to automated systems suitable for higher-cost locations like the U.S. and Japan. The collaboration anticipates setting up a prototype automated back-end production line in Japan within the next few years, with plans to standardize the technology for seamless integration across manufacturing, inspection, and handling processes. The project is financially supported by Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and may receive governmental funding of several tens of billions of yen. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) plans to invest $2.9 billion in Japanese data centers by 2025, marking its most significant investment in the country. This announcement coincided with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s visit to Washington, highlighting the global focus on AI and domestic computing capabilities. During Kishida’s visit to the Kumamoto plant, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM) CEO C.C. Wei declared TSMC’s target to source 60% of its materials locally by 2030 for its first chip manufacturing facility in Japan. The Japanese government has heavily backed this venture, contributing ¥476 billion ($3.1 billion) to establish TSMC’s first factory and an additional ¥732 billion in subsidies for a second fabrication plant in the area. Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS has also disclosed plans to invest about 2.3 trillion yen ($15.5 billion) in Japan from 2023 to 2027.

12 Best Large-Cap Growth ETFs,7/5/2024 15:09,Hamna Asim7 May 2024 at 8:09 am·17-min read,"In this article, we discuss 12 best large-cap growth ETFs. If you want to skip our discussion on growth investing, head over to 5 Best Large-Cap Growth ETFs.  Large-cap growth funds focus on investing in big companies, those in the top 70% in terms of market value. Growth funds constitute companies expected to grow their revenue or earnings faster than their peers or the overall market. They are often seen as risky but can be good for investors who are not risk averse and prefer long-term investments. Tom Hancock, who heads focused equity at GMO, joined CNBC’s ETF Edge on November 15, 2023, and remarked that the growth trade momentum is aided by the leadership of mega-cap tech companies that are embracing artificial intelligence. Similarly, Nathan Geraci, president of The ETF Store, agreed with Hancock's observation but noted that only a couple of stocks are leading the growth outperformance. In his words, Geraci commented: “A lot of growth performance this year has been driven by the so-called Magnificent Seven, because if you look at many of the growth indices, they’re pretty top-heavy. The largest growth companies have been enough to really drive that performance differential versus value.” Currently, US small-cap stocks are experiencing their toughest period compared to larger companies in over two decades. This reflects the investor preference for mega-cap tech stocks while smaller players grapple with inflated interest rates. According to a Financial Times report, the Russell 2000 index has seen a 24% increase since the start of 2020, significantly trailing behind the S&P 500's impressive 60% surge during the same period. This deviation from historical norms, where smaller, fast-growing companies typically offer higher returns despite higher volatility, underscores the current market dynamics. Greg Tuorto, a small-cap portfolio manager at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, pointed out the lack of significant investment in the small-cap space since 2016 or 2017, highlighting the need for increased market enthusiasm, perhaps through M&A activity or a flourishing IPO market, to reignite small-cap growth. While there are indications of the equity market expanding beyond tech giants, persistent inflation and a strong job market have led traders to accept the likelihood of higher interest rates for longer than previously anticipated. In a scenario where the Federal Reserve maintains or even raises rates, smaller companies with significant short-term or floating-rate debt, like those in the Russell 2000, are likely to be most affected. Further making a positive case for large-cap ETFs compared to their small-cap counterparts, an academic research paper took a close look at 66 large-cap and 34 small-cap ETFs listed in the United States from 2012 to 2016, covering the full trading history of these funds. The author chose to focus on the US market because it is a major player globally, and he wanted a robust sample size for the analysis. The study partially confirms what's known as the ""size effect"". Essentially, small-cap ETFs showed better returns compared to large-cap ETFs when looking at both raw and adjusted numbers. However, it is not all smooth sailing for small caps – they come with higher risk, which does not quite balance out the gains. Plus, this outperformance is not consistent year after year. When adjusted for risk, small-cap ETFs actually fall behind their larger counterparts. The same trend holds true when comparing the performance rankings of large-cap and small-cap ETFs. Some of the best large-cap growth ETFs include Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETF (NYSE:SCHG), Vanguard Growth Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VUG), and Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ). These funds expose investors to growth stocks like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). Our Methodology  We curated our list of the best large-cap growth ETFs by choosing consensus picks from multiple credible websites. We have mentioned the 5-year share price performance of each ETF as of May 3, 2024, ranking the list in ascending order of the share price performance. We have also discussed the top holdings of the ETFs to offer better insight to potential investors.

"Zacks.com featured highlights include Amazon, NVIDIA, Zscaler, Alaska Air and DocuSign",7/5/2024 10:47,Zacks Equity Research7 May 2024 at 3:47 am·6-min read,"Chicago, IL – May 7, 2024 – Stocks in this week’s article are Amazon.com AMZN, NVIDIA NVDA, Zscaler ZS, Alaska Air Group ALK and DocuSign DOCU. It is not surprising that before an earnings season, every investor looks for stocks that can beat market expectations. This is because investors always try to position themselves ahead of time and look to tap stocks that are of high quality. In this regard, we ran a screener that yielded Amazon.com, NVIDIA, Zscaler,Alaska Air Group and DocuSign as the likely winners on the earnings beat potential. Historically, stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings (on a nominal basis) tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations. After all, a 20% earnings rise (though it apparently looks good) doesn’t tell you if earnings growth has been exhibiting a decelerating trend. Also, seasonal fluctuations come into play sometimes. If a company’s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 strong, then it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline. In such cases, growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company. On the other hand, after much brainstorming and analysis of companies’ financials and initiatives, Wall Street analysts project earnings of companies. They, in fact, club their insights and a company’s guidance when deriving an earnings estimate. Thus, outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company’s own expectation as well as the market perception. And if the margin of earnings surprise is big, it typically drives the stock higher right after the release. Thus, more than anything else, an earnings surprise can push a stock higher. Now, finding stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line may be investors’ dream but not an easy job. One way to do this is to look at the earnings surprise history of the company. An impressive track in this regard generally acts as a catalyst in sending a stock higher. It indicates the company’s ability to surpass estimates. And investors generally believe that the company will apply the same secret sauce to execute yet another earning beat in its next release. A handful of criteria has narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to only nine.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-com-featured-highlights-amazon-104700364.html,AMZN

The Dow plunged 5%, marking its worst monthly performance since September 2022. The S&P 500 slid 4.2% and the Nasdaq Composite tumbled 4.4%. All three major stock indexes terminated a five-month winning streak. April is historically known as being favorable to Wall Street investors. We believe April's meltdown is nothing but a bull market correction and this time a welcome one. After a disappointing month, May opens a golden opportunity to enter the equity market for those investors suffering from the FOMO (fear of missing out) syndrome. Finally, recently released economic data boosted market participants’ confidence in equities. The Department of Labor reported that the U.S. economy added 175,000 jobs in April, missing the consensus estimate of 200,000. Job additions in March were revised upward by 12,000 while those of February were revised downward by 34,000. The unemployment rate increased to 3.9% in April, compared with the consensus estimate and March’s data of 3.8%. April marked the highest level since January 2022. Moreover, real unemployment rate (including discouraged workers and those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons) edged up to 7.4%, its highest level since November 2021. The labor force participation rate was unchanged at 62.7% in April. Month over month, the average hourly earnings rate dropped to 0.2% in April, compared with the consensus estimate and March’s data of 0.3%. Year over year, the wage rate increased 3.9% in April, below the consensus estimate of 4%. The average workweek decreased to 34.3. The Department of Commerce reported that U.S. GDP grew at a 1.6% annualized rate in first-quarter 2024, well below the consensus estimate of 2.5%. Moreover, the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) reported that both manufacturing and services PMIs (purchasing managers’ index) contracted in April. The manufacturing PMI for April came in at 49.2% and that of services PMI was 49.4%. Any reading below 50% indicates contraction in activities. The manufacturing PMI expanded in March after 16 consecutive months of contraction. It again contracted in April. The services PMI contracted in April after 15 successive months of expansion. Following the release of the April’s nonfarm payrolls, the CME FedWatch shows a 67.4% probability that the central bank will cut the benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points in the September FOMC meeting. The interest rate futures tool also shows a massive 91.5% probability that the Fed will cut rate by 50 basis points. Notably, the Fed fund rate currently stays within the range of 5.25-5.5% since July 2023. On May 1, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell categorically denied the resumption of the interest rate hike regime in his post-FOMC meeting statement. Moreover, the FOMC voted to ease the pace at which it is reducing bond holdings on the central bank’s gigantic balance sheet. The Fed started this program in June 2022, which was known as “quantitative tightening.” Its latest decision could be viewed as an incremental loosening of monetary policy.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-analyst-blog-highlights-alphabet-091900209.html,AMZN

Jim Cramer last week thanked Fed Chair Jerome Powell for giving an ""all-clear"" sign by keeping interest rates unchanged. Cramer said that the Fed's dovish comments catapulted the market from the pits of deep red to new highs. He thinks Jerome Powell has become ""the bull's friend for the moment, maybe best friend."" Jim Cramer said that despite the signs of ""softness all over the place,"" Powell is currently ""more of a dove than a hawk"" since he believes inflation will ""go away on its own."" Cramer said Jerome Powell was ""badgered"" by the media about the possibility of another rate hike. But Powell, according to Cramer, is ""too smart"" as he didn’t take the ""bait"" and took the ""dreaded"" rate hike scenario ""off the table.""

15 Countries with the Highest Average Salaries in Europe,6/5/2024 14:09,Afifa Mushtaque6 May 2024 at 7:09 am·10-min read,"In this article, we will look at the 15 countries with the highest average salaries in Europe. We have also discussed why Americans find Europe attractive for relocation. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Countries with the Highest Average Salaries in Europe. Europe has become a compelling destination for Americans that looking for relocation owing to obvious factors like quality of life, affordable housing, political stability, and remote work opportunities. However, moving to Europe's expensive cities can be a financial challenge, but for many Americans, the investment in quality of life pays off. In cities like Vienna, where childcare costs are significantly lower than in the US, families find raising children more manageable. While rent in European cities like Copenhagen, Stockholm, and Berlin can be steep, residents can not neglect the amazing benefits these regions have to offer. Moreover, Portugal is known to be one of the countries with high salary and low cost of living in Europe. On the other hand, Luxembourg is the country with the highest minimum wage in Europe, but it is still an expensive country to relocate to. To read about jobs and saalries in Europe, see the Most in Demand Jobs in Europe. Speaking of minimum wages, in 2024, minimum wages across Europe vary significantly. Among the 27 EU member states, 22 have established a national minimum wage. However, Denmark, Italy, Austria, Finland, and Sweden do not enforce one. The European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries, including Norway, Switzerland, and Iceland, also lack a national minimum wage policy. Cyprus recently introduced a minimum wage, while eight out of ten candidate and potential candidate countries have established their own. To read more about minimum wages, see the 20 Countries with the Highest Minimum Wage in the World. Despite the establishment of minimum wages across the continent, the minimum wage disparity is stark, ranging from €477 ($481)  in Bulgaria to €2,571 ($2770)  in Luxembourg on a gross monthly basis. Notably, the minimum wage is above €2,000 ($2154) in Luxembourg, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Germany. Conversely, in 14 out of 22 EU member states with a minimum wage, it falls below €1,000 ($1077) per month. Adjusting for purchasing power standard (PPS) reveals a narrower range, with minimum wages ranging from €542 ($584) in Albania to €1,883 ($2028) in Germany. The adequacy of minimum wages is a pressing concern, with ratios to median wages falling below 50% in ten EU countries in 2022. The EU's new directive aims to address this by setting a framework for regular revisions to ensure adequacy and protect the standard of living for low-paid workers. Speaking of adequacy, it is also interesting to note that more women are applying for jobs in Europe than in North America, with 52% of job applicants in the EMEA region being women, compared to 50% in North America, according to a March 2024 report from iCIMS. One factor contributing to the higher volume of female job applicants in Western Europe is the region's progressive stance on workplace gender balance. European employers have been actively implementing initiatives to close gender gaps, such as equal parental leave policies and accessible childcare services. These efforts have encouraged more women to seek employment opportunities, reflecting a cultural shift towards gender equality in the workforce. Before getting into our list of the countries with the highest average salaries in Europe, let’s look at the recent developments observed by multinationals in Europe to truly understand the attractiveness of Europe for salaries and jobs in general. In 2024, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is further expanding its European operations by investing over €700 million ($754.1 million) in robotics and AI-powered technologies for its fulfillment centers (FCs). With plans to introduce 120 new pieces of automation technology,  Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) plans to revolutionize its European network.

15 Worst States to Work in the US,6/5/2024 13:51,Afifa Mushtaque6 May 2024 at 6:51 am·10-min read,"In this article, we will look at the 15 worst states to work in the US. We have also discussed the state of labor unions and occupational fatal rates in the US that have direct implications for workers. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Worst States to Work in the US. In 2022, the United States witnessed 5,486 fatal work injuries with a 5.7% increase from the previous year. This equated to a worker dying approximately every 96 minutes due to a work-related injury, highlighting a concerning trend. Violence and other injuries by persons or animals increased by 11.6%, with homicides accounting for a significant portion of these fatalities, representing an 8.9% increase from the previous year. Furthermore, unintentional overdoses reached a series high of 525 fatalities, reflecting a continuing trend of annual increases since 2012. Transportation incidents remained the most frequent type of fatal event, constituting 37.7% of all occupational fatalities. Workers in transportation and material moving occupations experienced the highest number of fatal work injuries in 2022, followed closely by construction and extraction workers. Despite consecutive increases in 2021 and 2022, transportation incidents were still down 2.6 percent from pre-pandemic levels in 2019. However, roadway incidents involving motorized land vehicles reached a series high. In 2023, the United States witnessed a concerning trend in labor union membership, with rates hitting record lows despite headline-grabbing strikes across various sectors. Despite efforts to bolster membership, the union membership rate dropped to 10.0%, down from the previous record low of 10.1% in 2022. However, the number of union members increased slightly to 14.4 million, although this growth was overshadowed by the overall rise in employment among wage and salary workers. This decline in membership rates underscores a broader challenge facing organized labor in the country. While there were some successes in union organizing, particularly among people of color, the private sector continues to face issues. Private-sector union membership remained stagnant at a record-low 6%, indicating ongoing difficulties in organizing efforts. Additionally, the erosion of the wage premium traditionally enjoyed by union members is a cause for concern. Over the years, the weekly pay gap between union and non-union workers has narrowed, highlighting the changing dynamics of the labor market and the challenges faced by unions in negotiating favorable terms for their members. To read more about unions, see States That Have America’s Strongest Unions. Despite these challenges, unions still wield political influence, particularly in key states like Michigan and Pennsylvania. However, declining membership rates and ongoing struggles to maintain wage premiums suggest a need for labor unions to adapt to changing economic realities and employer tactics. The surge in strikes and organizing efforts in 2023 demonstrates a growing discontent among workers, but the effectiveness of these actions in reversing the decline in union membership remains uncertain. To read more about the best states for jobs, see the best states for job seekers right now. It is also worth highlighting that California and New York are known to be two of the best states in USA for working whereas Utah and Massachusetts are popular to be two of the best states to live in the US. Let’s talk about companies that are providing several career opportunities in 2024. Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) recently announced the opening of applications for its 2024 grants through the Amazon Literary Partnership. Since its establishment, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been instrumental in supporting writers and their narratives.

"Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",6/5/2024 13:00,Zacks Equity Research6 May 2024 at 6:00 am·5-min read,"Amazon (AMZN) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future. Shares of this online retailer have returned +0.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -1.6% change. The Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, to which Amazon belongs, has gained 4.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term? Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision. Earnings Estimate Revisions Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings. Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements. For the current quarter, Amazon is expected to post earnings of $1.02 per share, indicating a change of +61.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +10.5% over the last 30 days. For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.54 points to a change of +56.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +14.5%. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.77 indicates a change of +27.1% from what Amazon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +4.2%. With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Amazon.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-com-inc-amzn-attracting-130016689.html,AMZN
Play Likely Earnings Beat With These 5 Top-Ranked Stocks,6/5/2024 11:52,Sanghamitra Saha6 May 2024 at 4:52 am·6-min read,"It is not surprising that before an earnings season, every investor looks for stocks that can beat market expectations. This is because investors always try to position themselves ahead of time and look to tap stocks that are of high quality. In this regard, we ran a screener that yielded Amazon.com AMZN, NVIDIA NVDA, Zscaler ZS, Alaska Air Group ALK and DocuSign DOCU as the likely winners on the earnings beat potential. Historically, stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings (on a nominal basis) tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations. After all, a 20% earnings rise (though it apparently looks good) doesn’t tell you if earnings growth has been exhibiting a decelerating trend. Also, seasonal fluctuations come into play sometimes. If a company’s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 strong, then it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline. In such cases, growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company. On the other hand, after much brainstorming and analysis of companies’ financials and initiatives, Wall Street analysts project earnings of companies. They, in fact, club their insights and a company’s guidance when deriving an earnings estimate. Thus, outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company’s own expectation as well as the market perception. And if the margin of earnings surprise is big, it typically drives the stock higher right after the release. Thus, more than anything else, an earnings surprise can push a stock higher. Now, finding stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line may be investors’ dream but not an easy job. One way to do this is to look at the earnings surprise history of the company. An impressive track in this regard generally acts as a catalyst in sending a stock higher. It indicates the company’s ability to surpass estimates. And investors generally believe that the company will apply the same secret sauce to execute yet another earning beat in its next release. In order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise, we chose the following as our primary screening parameters.

The ending of Google's monopoly trial has Silicon Valley on edge,5/5/2024 11:38,Alexis Keenan·Reporter5 May 2024 at 4:38 am·5-min read,"Google has a lot at stake as a federal judge weighs whether the tech giant’s search empire should be broken up. So does the rest of Silicon Valley. A landmark antitrust case pitting Google (GOOG, GOOGL) against the Justice Department entered its final stage this past week as prosecutors from the federal government and 14 states said in their closing arguments that Google illegally monopolized the online search and search advertising markets. Google's lawyer, John Schmidtlein, pushed back one more time with a claim the company has made from the beginning: ""Google is winning because it’s better,"" he said. A government win would certainly threaten a giant piece of Google’s $237.8 billion profit engine. But the outcome, which will be decided by US District Judge Amit Mehta in the weeks or months to come, also has giant implications for some of the other big names in the tech world. That's because Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) are defending themselves against a series of other federal- and state-led antitrust suits, some of which make similar claims, and because all three stand to lose or gain depending on the outcome. In Apple’s case, US attorneys have alleged the iPhone maker blocked rivals from entering the smartphone market by using a “web of contractual restrictions.” A similar claim was made by the government in Google's case, which hinges on several types of contracts that Google allegedly used to cement its search dominance. ""The broad lessons here are a long way off, but this is clearly a really important time when the very first of these tech cases is going to be decided,"" said University of Washington antitrust professor Douglas Ross. ""I do think they're going to be interested in how narrowly or broadly [the judge] defines the markets here,"" Ross added, ""and if there is any learning in what he writes that might have application elsewhere.""",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/the-ending-of-googles-monopoly-trial-has-silicon-valley-on-edge-113835464.html,AMZN
"E-commerce is witnessing the Amazon-ification of Shein, as the fast-fashion behemoth woos skincare and toy brands",5/5/2024 11:00,Sasha Rogelberg5 May 2024 at 4:00 am·5-min read,"E-commerce giant Shein is spreading its arms to envelope more than just the fashion and apparel for which it’s known—and it’s starting to look like another familiar online market platform in the process. Shein is wooing brands such as household goods conglomerate Colgate-Palmolive, toy maker Hasbro, and skincare brands to sell their products in its marketplace, Reuters reported Tuesday. The company, known for affordable and stylish clothes—albeit made with concerns about labor practices and its environmental impact—is taking steps to create a platform that is everything to everyone. ""Everybody associates Shein with fashion, but we are doing all verticals,"" Christina Fontana, Shein’s senior director of brand operations for Europe, Middle East and Africa, said at a Paris conference on April 17, according to Reuters. ""Our consumers want brands, [so] if that's what they're looking for, that's what we're going to give them,” she added. Shein’s outward expansion is a clear tactic to take a bigger piece of the e-commerce pie, Steve Tadelis, economic analysis and policy professor at the University of California at Berkeley, told Fortune. Shein has the largest fast-fashion market share in the U.S, and its annual profit doubled to $2 billion in 2023 from the year before. It's eyeing an IPO and a whopping $90 billion valuation. While the size of its retail empire still pales in comparison to Amazon’s stranglehold on 38% of the U.S. e-commerce market, Tadelis said Shein will want to go after the industry leader. “It shouldn't be surprising that with all of the regulators around the world and talking about the Amazon monopoly that needs to be reined in, well, Shein is now taking a bite out of their apple and will probably take more of those bites,” he said. Shein, a China-based fast-fashion platform founded by billionaire Sky Xu in 2008, has skyrocketed to success and 45 million monthly users through its massive and efficient production and distribution strategies. Using AI and electronic monitoring, Shein is able to identify online trends, turn to its suppliers to manufacture small batches of products, then take initial sales data to decide to mass produce a product. The system nearly guarantees the company has its finger on the pulse of trends and can deliver goods fast, though it’s gotten into hot water over allegations of copyright infringement and data scraping, as well as the proliferation of counterfeit product listings. Even as regulatory bodies, like the European Union’s European Commission, have tried to put checks and balances on the company to stymie its questionable business practices, Shein may have found a way around that.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/e-commerce-witnessing-amazon-ification-110000742.html,AMZN
Should You Invest in Amazon (AMZN) Based on Bullish Wall Street Views?,3/5/2024 13:30,Zacks Equity Research3 May 2024 at 6:30 am·4-min read,"Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter? Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Amazon (AMZN) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage. Amazon currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.11, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 47 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.11 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy. Of the 47 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 43 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 91.5% and 6.4% of all recommendations. Brokerage Recommendation Trends for AMZN Check price target & stock forecast for Amazon here>>>The ABR suggests buying Amazon, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation. Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations. This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements. With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.

Online Retail ETF (ONLN) Hits New 52-Week High,3/5/2024 13:22,Sweta Killa3 May 2024 at 6:22 am·1-min read,"For investors seeking momentum, ProShares Online Retail ETF ONLN is probably on the radar. The fund just hit a 52-week high and is up about 41% from its 52-week low price of $28.50/share.But are more gains in store for this ETF? Let’s take a quick look at the fund and the near-term outlook on it to get a better idea of where it might be headed: ProShares Online Retail ETF offers exposure to companies that principally sell online or through other non-store channels and then zeroes in on companies that reshape the retail space. It charges 58 bps in annual fees (see: all the Consumer Discretionary ETFs here). The online retail corner of the broad consumer discretionary sector has been an area to watch lately, given the robust first-quarter 2024 results from Amazon AMZN. The e-commerce giant beat both earnings and revenue estimates driven by growth in its advertising and AI-powered cloud computing business. Amazon makes up for the top firm in ONLN with 24% of assets. ONLN might remain strong, given a weighted alpha of 38.70 and a higher 20-day volatility of 26%. There is definitely still some promise for investors who want to ride on this surging ETF.

"Results: Amazon.com, Inc. Exceeded Expectations And The Consensus Has Updated Its Estimates",3/5/2024 13:18,editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St)3 May 2024 at 6:18 am·3-min read,"Investors in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) had a good week, as its shares rose 6.4% to close at US$185 following the release of its first-quarter results. It looks like a credible result overall - although revenues of US$143b were in line with what the analysts predicted, Amazon.com surprised by delivering a statutory profit of US$0.98 per share, a notable 18% above expectations. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. Readers will be glad to know we've aggregated the latest statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their mind on Amazon.com after the latest results.  See our latest analysis for Amazon.com  Taking into account the latest results, the consensus forecast from Amazon.com's 56 analysts is for revenues of US$638.8b in 2024. This reflects a solid 8.1% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to surge 23% to US$4.44. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$641.6b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$4.15 in 2024. The analysts seems to have become more bullish on the business, judging by their new earnings per share estimates. There's been no major changes to the consensus price target of US$216, suggesting that the improved earnings per share outlook is not enough to have a long-term positive impact on the stock's valuation. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. There are some variant perceptions on Amazon.com, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$245 and the most bearish at US$180 per share. This shows there is still a bit of diversity in estimates, but analysts don't appear to be totally split on the stock as though it might be a success or failure situation. These estimates are interesting, but it can be useful to paint some more broad strokes when seeing how forecasts compare, both to the Amazon.com's past performance and to peers in the same industry. We would highlight that Amazon.com's revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 11% annualised growth rate until the end of 2024 being well below the historical 17% p.a. growth over the last five years. Juxtapose this against the other companies in the industry with analyst coverage, which are forecast to grow their revenues (in aggregate) 10% annually. Factoring in the forecast slowdown in growth, it looks like Amazon.com is forecast to grow at about the same rate as the wider industry. The biggest takeaway for us is the consensus earnings per share upgrade, which suggests a clear improvement in sentiment around Amazon.com's earnings potential next year. They also reconfirmed their revenue estimates, with the company predicted to grow at about the same rate as the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$216, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets. Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings.

Amazon Web Services CEO: We're on track to hit $100 billion in sales in 2024,3/5/2024 12:25,Brian Sozzi·Executive Editor3 May 2024 at 5:25 am·3-min read,"What's in the clouds for Amazon's (AMZN) lucrative AWS business: $100 billion in 2024 sales. ""This quarter, we just announced a few days ago that AWS did hit the $100 billion annualized revenue run rate milestone — not many tech companies have done that,"" AWS CEO Adam Selipsky said on the Opening Bid podcast (video above). Added Selipsky, ""I think it's a notable milestone."" Powered by voracious demand for generative AI services and the ongoing push to move workloads to the cloud, Amazon's enterprise cloud operation is fresh off a bang-up first quarter. AWS sales accelerated for the second straight quarter, rising 17% year over year to $25 billion. The business — which Amazon CEO Andy Jassy hired Selipsky to run in 2021 — saw operating profits nearly double to $9.4 billion. The division represented about 62% of Amazon's Q1 operating profits. Selipsky contends that with 85% of companies still storing their data on-premise, the tailwinds for AWS are just beginning to gust. ""We're optimistic about the business outlook for AWS and I think it can continue to grow really rapidly. I don't really see an upper limit on it,"" Selipsky says. ""Of course it's not our birthright, it's not guaranteed. We'll only be as successful as what we do tomorrow for customers."" The avid water skier and wine aficionado says he doesn't wake up each day thinking about crushing rivals Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL). Rather, he spends his time plotting out how to keep customers happy — part of the ""Day One"" culture etched into the company by founder Jeff Bezos.

25 Most Profitable Companies in the US,2/5/2024 16:20,Ramish Cheema2 May 2024 at 9:20 am·9-min read,"In this piece, we will take a look at the 25 most profitable companies in the US. If you want to skip our overview of the US economy and the current business climate, you can jump ahead to the 5 Most Profitable Companies in the US.  With the second quarter of 2024 with us, Wall Street is focused on determining whether companies that are investing in AI are actually bringing in money or whether they are investing costly capital to set themselves up for future growth. Firms that belong to the former sector, i.e. those that are making money from AI, have been rewarded as has been the case with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). Just like NVIDIA is Wall Street's favorite AI stock when it comes to semiconductors needed to power up large data processing software, Microsoft is the king of the jungle when it comes to AI software. In the latter segment, the best example is Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) whose shares have dropped after the latest earnings report revealed that 2024 will require an additional $40 billion in capital to fund AI growth. This sharp eye on AI comes when investors are grappling with an economy that might be starting to slow down just as the Federal Reserve finds it difficult to tamp down on inflation. While the AI gold rush of 2023 put inflation and other macroeconomic indicators on the backdrop, after the inflation data for March 2024, they are back in the spotlight. This environment, which has left investors eager to flee away from stocks once again comes as profitability becomes key, particularly as profits are important to enable firms to position themselves for growth (such as is the case with AI stocks) or keep investors happy by paying out dividends. US companies are also some of the biggest in the world when it comes to profits. America's corporate sector, particularly the technology industry, is the most developed in the world. Firms such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) are able to compete with the world's largest state owned enterprises when it comes to revenue. In fact, Apple is the first company in the world that has proven that technology and personal computing is a more lucrative industry than oil - a commodity that is responsible for powering daily lives. To understand how, consider that Apple's trailing twelve month revenue as of December 2023 sits at a whopping $385 billion. Now, compare this with the net sales of the Saudi state owned oil giant Saudi Arabian Oil Company (TADAWUL:2222.SR), which has raked in SAR2 trillion during the same time period. Using an exchange rate of 3.75 SAR to a dollar leads to approximately $530 billion in revenue for the Saudi oil giant. While naturally, Aramco's revenue is higher since it does not have any comparable competitors on a global level, the fact that a consumer technology firm that is dependent not only on the need to stay abreast with innovation but also with what its rivals are doing is able to earn more than half of the revenue is something in itself to say the least. As a whole, Insider Monkey also looked at the 30 Largest Companies in the World by Revenue. This shows that US companies reign supreme even though Aramco enjoys free access to the vast global crude oil market. The US retail giant Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) tops this list courtesy of its $648 billion in sales, showing that a well run privately owned company has the full potential to take on massive state owned giants. But what about profits? After all, even if a firm makes hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue, its investors get nothing if money does not flow through the income statement and into retained earnings. Today, we'll look at some of the most profitable companies in America, with a couple of top picks being Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).

"AI investments are showing signs of a payoff, but the price is steep",2/5/2024 9:13,Daniel Howley·Technology Editor2 May 2024 at 2:13 am·4-min read,"Tech earnings season is in full swing, and while a handful of notable players still need to report, namely Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA), there’s one key throughline running through the announcements so far: It’s taking a lot of money to make money on AI. Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT), four of tech’s biggest AI players, have each called out AI sales growth, though without many specifics, while pointing to increased spending on capital expenditures to meet AI demand. Microsoft announced last week it spent $14 billion on capital expenditures tied to its AI buildout in its fiscal third quarter, up from $7.8 billion in the same period last year. The company’s 2024 capital expenditures have already eclipsed its spending across all of 2023, and there’s still another quarter left in its fiscal year. Google parent Alphabet said it spent $12 billion in the last quarter and will continue at that pace for the rest of the year. Meta similarly said it’s cranking up spending for the full year from $30 billion-$37 billion to $35 billion-$40 billion. And CFO Susan Li said that number will increase in the year ahead as well. And on Tuesday, Amazon said it would blow past last year’s $48.4 billion in capital expenditures, saying the $14 billion it spent in Q1 will be the low for the year. Those are mountains of cash. And while there are early signs that AI is driving revenue growth, it’ll take time before it truly makes an impact on companies’ bottom lines. “I'm thinking it's a 12- to 18-month investment period before we start to see a lot of this really pay off big time,” TECHnalysis founder and chief analyst Bob O’Donnell told Yahoo Finance. Generative AI is still a relatively new technology. Sure, it blew up in 2023, but corporations are slow-moving entities, and many are only starting to try out generative AI applications across their business segments. “If I sign up for Microsoft 365 with Microsoft, do I sign up all of my 100,000 employees or do I sign up 500 to check it out?” O’Donnell asked, adding that companies are starting out with a smaller number of signups to get a sense of how they can best use AI applications on the job before signing up the rest of their employees. That’s not necessarily a bad thing for tech companies. During its earnings call last week, Microsoft said AI accounted for 7 percentage points of revenue growth in its Azure and other cloud services business. That was up from 6 percentage points in the prior quarter and 3 percentage points in the quarter before that. In Q4 last year, the company said AI drove 1 percentage point of growth in Azure.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-investments-are-showing-signs-of-a-payoff-but-the-price-is-steep-181413381.html,AMZN
Time to Buy Amazon (AMZN) Stock After AWS Fuels Strong Q1 Results,1/5/2024 23:20,Shaun Pruitt1 May 2024 at 4:20 pm·2-min read,"Amazon AMZN was the latest tech giant to impressively top Q1 expectations reporting after market hours on Tuesday and seeing its stock spike +2% in today’s trading session.

First quarter sales increased 12% to $143.3 billion and came in slightly above estimates of $142.52 billion. AWS contributed $25 billion to the top line, beating estimates by 3% and increasing 17% year over year as Amazon remains the domestic cloud leader ahead of Microsoft’s (MSFT) Azure and Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google Cloud. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research More importantly, Amazon’s operating income skyrocketed 221% to 15.3 billion. This led to earnings of $1.13 per share which beat the Zacks Consensus of $0.83 a share by 36% and climbed from $0.31 a share in the comparative quarter.

Amazon and robot vacuum maker iRobot in January dropped their plans to tie-up in the face of opposition from European and U.S. antitrust regulators. ""The FTC’s anticompetitive actions threaten to harm America’s global position in the personal robotics market, while ceding market share of personal robotics to foreign entities such as China,"" Republican Representative James Comer said in a letter to the FTC asking for documents shared by the FTC with the European Commission. ""The FTC’s actions indicate to American businesses that the FTC will work outside of U.S. antitrust law by using the EC to realize its desired outcomes."" The FTC declined to comment. Amazon and iRobot did not immediately comment. After the deal collapsed, iRobot in January announced a significant restructuring plan to reduce costs and said it would cut about 31% of its workforce, or 350 jobs. The company also said founder Colin Angle had stepped down as its CEO. Amazon said in January the deal had no path to regulatory approval in the European Union. EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager in January said its in-depth investigation preliminarily showed ""the acquisition of iRobot would have enabled Amazon to foreclose iRobot's rivals by restricting or degrading access to Amazon stores.""

Amazon's Smashing Q1 Financials Show The Power Of A Good And Well Executed Strategy,1/5/2024 15:03,Upwallstreet1 May 2024 at 8:03 am·4-min read,"Like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), Snap Inc (NYSE: SNAP) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL),  Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) reported better-than-expected quarterly results, with stronger than expected revenue being the result of the improvements on the ad business front. In part due to its booming AWS division and its advertising service, Amazon reported revenue grew 12.52% YoY to $143.3 billion, surpassing LSEG’s estimate of $142.5 billion. Operating income far outpaced revenue growth as well as it soared more than 200% to $15.3 billion, which is the first sign that Amazon’s cost-cutting initiatives and efficiency improvements are benefiting the bottom line as net income skyrocketed 229% YoY to $10.43 billion, with diluted EPS amounting to 98 cents a share, surpassing LSEG’s estimate of 83 cents. Amazon’s businesses are thriving, beginning with party seller services that cover commissions that Amazon collects, along with fulfillment, shipping fees and other charges, grew 16% YoY to $34.5 billion. AWS continues to grow and challenge Google and Microsoft, both the cloud and AI front. The AWS division reported a 17% YoY growth to $25 billion, surpassing StreetAccount’s estimate of $24.5 billion and reflecting Amazon’s strong positioning compared to its AI rivals, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), who secured a leadership position with its early entry and OpenAI acquisition, and Alphabet, with the latter finally catching up to its peers in their efforts to lead the way into the golden age of AI. AWS’ actions could spell trouble for Alphabet and Microsoft as Jassy revealed significant investments over the next few years to build new infrastructure and data centers. Amazon will be investing $5.3 billion in Saudi Arabia and $5 billion in Mexico to build new infrastructure centers, along with $10 billion in Mississippi to build two data centers that are projected to create at least 1,000 jobs. Advertising continues to grow, becoming an increasingly important profit driver. Advertising revenue grew 24% to $11.8 billion, outpacing both retail and cloud computing growth, as well as StreetAccount’s estimate of $11.7 billion. This is the first report since Amazon introduced ads in Prime Video, which analysts expect to generate significant revenue over time. Despite being new to the ad business, Amazon has emerged as one of the big players in the online advertising arena. CEO Andy Jassy has made it clear that the e-commerce and cloud titan will continue to focus on its ad efforts, as it plans include more of its sponsored content on its Prime Video platform. First quarter results across the board show that online ads have rebounded. Last week, Alphabet also announced its ad business reaccelerated after a tough 2022 and 2023. Google reported total ad sales rose from last year’s comparable quarter, when they amounted to $54.55 billion, to $61.66 billion. Amazon expects profitability growth to continue in the current quarter but at a more measured pace as it guided for an operating income between $10 billion and $14 billion, on the back of revenue in the range between $144 billion to $149 billion, translating to revenue growth in the range between 7% and 11%.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/amazons-smashing-q1-financials-show-150329689.html,AMZN
"Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript",1/5/2024 14:22,Insider Monkey Transcripts1 May 2024 at 7:22 am·21-min read,"Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript April 30, 2024 Amazon.com, Inc. beats earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $0.978, expectations were $0.82. Operator: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com First Quarter 2024 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After a presentation, we’ll conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. And for opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dave Fildes. Please go ahead. Dave Fildes: Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2024 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Andy Jassy, our CEO; and Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2023. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 30, 2024, only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, cloud services and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now I'll turn the call over to Andy. Andy Jassy: Thanks, Dave. Today, we're reporting $143.3 billion in revenue, up 13% year-over-year, excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates; $15.3 billion in operating income, up 221% year-over-year or $10.5 billion; and $48.8 billion in trailing 12-month free cash flow adjusted for equipment finance leases, up $53.2 billion year-over-year. We remain focused on driving better experiences for our customers while also delivering efficiency improvements. Our financial results are an encouraging reminder of the progress we're making. Starting with our stores business, despite having hundreds of millions of items and the broadest selection available, we remain intensely focused on adding even more selection. One way is to continue adding brands we know our customers want. For instance, in the US, we recently welcomed Clinique and two Gen Z fashion favorites, Parade and Cider, and announced a collaboration with Hardly Ever Worn It in Europe to offer customers pre-owned items from luxury brands. Another way to drive selection is to make it easier for our third-party sellers to add their products to our store. We've recently launched a new generative AI tool that enables sellers to simply provide a URL to their own website, and we automatically create high-quality product detail pages on Amazon. Already, over 100,000 of our selling partners have used one or more of our GenAI tools. We remain focused on making sure we're offering everyday low prices, which we know is even more important to our customers in this uncertain economic environment. As our results show, customers are shopping but remain cautious, trading down on price when they can and seeking out deals. In Q1, we helped customers save with shopping events worldwide, including our first big spring sale in Canada and the US. We also held spring deal days in Europe and our Ramadan event in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. Delivery speed really matters to customers, and we've continued to get faster while improving our safety performance. In this past Q1, we delivered to Prime members at our fastest speeds ever. In March, across our top 60 largest US metro areas, nearly 60% of Prime members orders arrived the same or next day. And globally, in cities like Toronto, London, and Tokyo, about three out of four items were delivered the same or next day. Faster delivery times have another important effect. As we get items to customers this fast, customers choose Amazon to fulfill their shopping needs more frequently, and we can see the results in various areas, including how fast our Everyday Essentials business is growing and the continued increase in Prime member purchase frequency and total spend with us. Over the past year, we've talked about how our regionalization efforts have helped to lower our cost to serve. We've continued to inspect our fulfillment network for additional opportunities and are working on several areas where we believe we can lower costs even further while also improving customer experience. One example of this is our work to increase the consolidation of units into fewer boxes.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-com-inc-nasdaq-amzn-142248226.html,AMZN

Net sales rose 13% from the same period last year to $143.3 billion, Amazon reported late Tuesday, topping analyst expectations of $142.6 billion, per Bloomberg data.

Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky said on a call with reporters following the report that overall capital expenditures are expected to ""meaningfully"" increase this year from nearly $50 billion in 2023, driven by higher infrastructure costs to support growth in AWS.

Amazon’s generative AI business has hit a multi-billion dollar run rate that’s reaccelerated cloud growth,1/5/2024 0:37,Jason Del Rey30 April 2024 at 5:37 pm·3-min read,"Generative AI is now contributing revenue to Amazon's cloud business at annualized rate equivalent to multiple billions of dollars, re-accelerating growth at Amazon Web Services and providing a business gusher that company officials expect will continue to pay off for decades. Amazon recorded its largest quarterly operating profit in its history in the first quarter, the tech giant announced on Tuesday, as Amazon Web Services hit a $100 billion annual revenue run rate and CEO Andy Jassy's multi-year, cost-cutting maneuvering padded the bottom line. AWS revenue in the first three months of the year increased by 17%, the fastest clip since 2022. Jassy used his call with Wall Street analysts to continue to raise expectations about how transformational generative AI technologies will be to Amazon's future financial performance and to AWS clients. Tens of thousands of customers are already using Amazon's cloud-based AI service, known as Bedrock, and Jassy predicted that many more will embrace generative AI as they discover how easily it can be integrated into their products. ""Unlike with the cloud where there's a lot of work to be done to move from on-premise [servers] to the cloud,"" Jassy said, ""all of these generative AI...workloads..are going to be built from scratch on the cloud largely."" While many AI companies, including Anthropic, currently use AWS services to train the large language models that underpin their products, Amazon executives on Tuesday's earnings call said that the bigger long term business opportunity could come from companies operating their AI models on its cloud, a process called ""inference."" Jassy said that Gen AI-related business is currently on track to drive multiple billion dollars of AWS revenue this year, and that he believes the AI business boom could last for ten to twenty years as customers embrace the technology. Amazon's upfront investments to fulfill longterm AI demand will not be cheap. The company spent more than $48 billion on capital expenditures in 2023, and executives said that number will ""meaningfully increase"" in 2024, though they did not specify by how much. Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky did say that the $14 billion Amazon spent in capital expenditures in the first quarter is expected to be the lowest quarterly total for the year. While some of that spending is going toward Amazon's continued investment in expanding its warehouse footprint and fleet of delivery vans, the primary reason for the step-up is to support AWS' growth and the demand from the generative AI boom. At a higher level, Amazon executives said they believe that AWS clients are largely past the cost-optimization focus of the first couple years of the pandemic and ready to focus on modernizing their tech infrastructure and investing in new areas such as Gen AI. Internally, divisions of the company focused on AI products and services are some of the only ones where Amazon employees should expect to see significant hiring, the CFO alluded. ""Generally most teams are working hard to keep headcount flat and...automate what we can,” Olsavsky said on a media call with reporters.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-generative-ai-business-hit-003749277.html,AMZN
Amazon sales soar with boost from artificial intelligence and advertising,30/4/2024 22:47,Kari Paul30 April 2024 at 3:47 pm·3-min read,"Amazon profits soared once again in the first quarter of 2024, the company announced on Tuesday – the latest in a series of robust earnings reports for the retail giant. The company attributed the boost to artificial intelligence and advertising sales. Amazon reported overall revenue of $143.3bn in the first three months of the year – up 13% from the same period in 2023 and surpassing Wall Street expectations of $142.65bn. The e-commerce giant reported an increase of more than 200% to $15bn, with net income more than tripling to $10.4bn from $3.17bn at the same time in 2023. Related: Meta says revenue will be weak as it spends even more on AI In a statement accompanying the report, the chief executive, Andy Jassy, said Amazon’s continuing focus on AI has “reaccelerat[ed]” the growth rate of Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company’s cloud-computing sector. Revenue at AWS increased 17% year-over-year to $25bn, and AWS accounted for 62% of total operating profit. In a call following the report, Jassy said Amazon still has a lot of room to grow in the generative AI sector. The boost to AWS comes after growth in the sector had slowed recently. Executives attributed the slump to recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, which had pushed many companies to improve cloud infrastructure to support remote work. That trend is stabilizing, they said, and demand for AI can further boost its cloud services. “We remain very bullish in AWS,” Jassy said. “We’re at a $100bn-dollar annualized revenue run right now, and this is before you even calculate generative AI. There’s a very large opportunity in front of us.” Advertising sales, meanwhile, increased 24% year-over-year to $11.8bn, after the company expanded its advertising, including rolling out ads on Prime Video, starting earlier this year. As Amazon ramps up its cloud-computing and AI capabilities, it will need to spend more on infrastructure to support the technology, Jassy said on the investor call Tuesday. Capital expenditure (capex) was at $14bn for the quarter, and Jassy said it is expected to increase in subsequent quarters of the fiscal year. “The more demand AWS has, the more we have to procure new data centers’ power and hardware,” he said, adding that the company does not spend capital “without very clear signals that we can monetize it”. Last week, Meta’s shares plummeted on news that the company would increase its capital expenditure to build up its AI capabilities. The earnings report comes after Amazon announced it would invest $11bn to build more data centers in Indiana, promising at least 1,000 jobs there. Also in the quarter, the company extended its partnership with chip manufacturer Nvidia to continue to power its AI offerings.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-sales-soar-boost-artificial-205700617.html,AMZN

This compares to earnings of $0.31 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 36.14%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this online retailer would post earnings of $0.81 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.01, delivering a surprise of 24.69%. Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times. Amazon , which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, posted revenues of $143.31 billion for the quarter ended March 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.55%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $127.36 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. Amazon shares have added about 19.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 7.3%. What's Next for Amazon? While Amazon has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.

Amazon shrugs off Chinese competition as profits rise,30/4/2024 20:56,Matthew Field30 April 2024 at 1:56 pm·2-min read,"Amazon has shrugged off competition from fast-growing Chinese rivals to post its strongest-ever start to the year. The tech giant posted profits of $10.4bn (£8.3bn) in the first three months of 2024, up from $3.2bn during the same period last year. This came despite the growing threat from China’s online retail giants such as Shein and Temu. The latest jump in profits stemmed from revenues surging 13pc to $143.3bn in the first quarter, driven by strong retail sales in North America and rapid growth across its digital infrastructure division, Amazon Web Services (AWS). Amazon hailed surging demand for its artificial intelligence (AI) services, which fall under its AWS arm. Bosses now expect the AWS division to post more than $100bn in turnover across this year as a whole. Shares briefly jumped more than 6pc following the trading update before dropping back to around 2pc. The results, posted on Tuesday night, come as Amazon executives increasingly focus their attention on competition from Chinese shopping sites. Temu, which is owned by China’s PDD, has rapidly grown to tens of millions of monthly shoppers, who have been drawn in by its bargain prices and the tagline “shop like a billionaire”. The Wall Street Journal reported last month that Temu had more than 50m US shoppers on its app despite launching just over a year ago.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-shrugs-off-chinese-competition-205623571.html,AMZN

The Seattle-based e-commerce giant said it brought in $143.31 billion in revenue in the first three months of this year, a 13% jump compared to the same period last year. Net income came out to $10.43 billion, or 98 cents per share. That soundly beat Wall Street analysts' expectations for 84 cents a share, according to FactSet. “It was a good start to the year across the business, and you can see that in both our customer experience improvements and financial results,” Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in a statement. The nation’s biggest online retailer is coming off better-than-expected results for the holiday shopping period, when it saw strong consumer spending aided by discounts and faster shipping speeds. Amazon held another discount event in late March, right before the end of the first quarter. Aside from its core retail business, Amazon said first-quarter sales in its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services. amounted to $25.04 billion, up 17% from the same period last year. Sales in the company's online advertising business also spiked 24%, partly driven by an influx of ad dollars coming from Prime Video. After years of giving Prime subscribers ad-free access to their favorite movies and TV shows, Amazon implemented a new policy in late January that lets viewers avoid ads only if they pay an additional $2.99 a month. Shares in Amazon.com Inc. rose 3% in after-hours trading. The company says it expects to post net sales between $144 billion and $149 billion during the second quarter.

The move will impact 51 locations in five states, as well as relationships with health systems, like the one penned with Florida's Orlando Health in November. In its announcement, Walmart cited a ""challenging reimbursement environment and escalating operating costs"" as contributing to a ""lack of profitability that make the care business unsustainable for us at this time."" The company declined to comment to Yahoo Finance on the business segment's profitability, or lack thereof. And did not have an answer as to what will happen with the newly-built clinic offices. ""We continually assess our business, once we made the decision, we moved quickly and with appropriate speed, which we believe was in the best interest of our associates, patients and communities,"" Walmart said in an emailed response. A spokesperson said the locations would likely close within a 45- to 90-day time frame. Walmart is just the latest in a string of retail healthcare pullbacks. Walgreens (WBA) announced that it will close 160 of its VillageMD clinics and only maintain the busiest sites, just a few years after investing $5.2 billion to acquire a majority stake in the business. And recently, UnitedHealth Group's (UNH) Optum division confirmed it was ending its telehealth services — which it started offering during the pandemic at no out-of-pocket cost to members. Craig Garthwaite, health economist and professor at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, said that Walmart relied too heavily on its retail strategy in the more complex healthcare system.

Yusuf Mehdi, Microsoft executive vice president and consumer chief marketing officer, said the company expects over 50 million AI PCs to be purchased over the next year. Copilot+ PCs are an offshoot of AI PCs, which are generally defined as PCs running on Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), and Qualcomm (QCOM) chips with built-in neural processing units, or neural engines, that can run generative AI applications locally without needing to connect to the internet. Copilot+ PCs will include 16GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage to ensure performance.

The assistant could see what the user was doing in the game and walk him through everything he needed to do to build the item.

Data centers have increasingly found homes in the Nordic countries, benefiting from the region's cooler climate, tax incentives, and ample renewable energy resources, reported Reuters. However, neighboring countries like Sweden and Norway have started to voice concerns about hosting these energy-intensive facilities. Industry experts suggest that these nations should prioritize renewable energy for high-value products like green steel. Finland, in contrast, has seen a rapid expansion of its wind power capacity, growing by 75% to 5,677 megawatts in 2022. This growth has occasionally led to negative electricity prices on windy days, indicating an excess of renewable energy.

Google invests 1 billion euros in Finnish data centre to drive AI growth,20/5/2024 10:30,Reuters20 May 2024 at 3:30 am·2-min read,"HELSINKI (Reuters) - Alphabet-owned Google will invest a further 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) into the expansion of its data centre campus in Finland to drive its artificial intelligence (AI) business growth in Europe, it said in a statement on Monday. In recent years, many data centres have been located in the Nordic countries because of the region's cooler climate, tax breaks and abundant availability of renewable power. Finland's Nordic neighbours Sweden and Norway have recently grown increasingly critical of hosting them, with some industry experts arguing the Nordic countries should use their renewable power for products such as green steel that could leave higher surplus value in the countries. But Finland's wind power capacity has increased so rapidly in recent years, by 75% to 5,677 megawatts in 2022 alone, that on windy days prices have plummeted to negative, industry statistics showed. Therefore there is still renewable capacity available for data centres such as Google's, which acquires wind power in Finland under long term contracts. Analysts believe data centres' power consumption is set to massively increase due to the rapid growth in AI usage, which Google, too, cited for one of the reasons behind its investment decision, alongside its Hamina data centre in Finland already operating with 97% carbon-free energy. ""Heat coming out of our Finnish data center will be re-routed to the district heating network in nearby Hamina, covering local households, schools and public service buildings,"" Google said in the statement.

Microsoft debuts 'Copilot+' PCs with AI features,20/5/2024 22:20,Max A. CherneyUpdated 20 May 2024 at 3:20 pm·4-min read,"By Max A. Cherney SEATTLE (Reuters) -Microsoft on Monday debuted a new category of personal computers with AI features as it rushes to build the emerging technology into products across its business and compete with Alphabet and Apple. At an event on its campus in Redmond, Washington, Chief Executive Satya Nadella introduced what Microsoft calls ""Copilot+"" PCs, saying that it and a range of manufacturers would sell them, including Acer and Asustek Computer. Microsoft launched the laptops as its shares trade near record highs following a Wall Street rally driven by expectations that AI will fuel strong profit growth for the company and its Big Tech rivals.

The ability to crunch AI data directly on the computer lets Copilot+ include a feature called ""Recall."" ""Recall"" tracks everything done on the computer, from Web browsing to voice chats, creating a history stored on the computer that the user can search when they need to remember something they did, even months later.

Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks in 2024,19/5/2024 17:17,Fahad Saleem19 May 2024 at 12:17 pm·7-min read,"Over the past few years, Michael Burry has gained more media attention with his recession warnings and market crash ""predictions"" than he did for accurately foreseeing the 2008 financial crisis. But his persistent warnings about recession and market crashes never realized, denting his reputation as an expert and hedge fund manager. A cursory look at Burry's portfolio moves shows that he's becoming more fickle than ever, constantly buying stocks and then selling them after a few months. In 2022, when the inflation storm was at its peak and the market was panicking, Burry tweeted: ""As I said about 2008, it is like watching a plane crash. It hurts, it is not fun, and I'm not smiling."" In August 2023, Wall Street Journal analyzed Michael Burry's recession warnings and found that he's made at least five ""dire"" market predictions. But that's not the news. The news is that each time he predicted something horrifying about the market, the S&P 500 saw positive returns over the next six months. Six-month average annualized gain posted by the S&P 500 following these five Burry predictions was 34%. Why are Michael Burry's market predictions not accurate anymore? Researchers Jerker Denrell and Christina Fang in 2010 published an interesting research paper titled Predicting the Next Big Thing: Success as a Signal of Poor Judgment. The paper talked about the reasons why experts who make accurate predictions about ""extreme"" events often follow up with more, and fail. The paper highlighted several reasons behind this trend, but one of these was overconfidence. ""An alternative explanation of our results is that a successful prediction generates overconfidence. Overconfident individuals, who overestimate the precision of their private information relative to publicly available information, are likely to make less accurate predictions. For example, Hilary and Menzly (2006) show that analysts who have predicted earnings more accurately than the median analyst in the previous four quarters tend to be simultaneously less accurate and further from the consensus in their subsequent predictions.""

Google remains focused on its long quest for your eyeballs,19/5/2024 12:00,Nick Robins-Early19 May 2024 at 5:00 am·6-min read,"Google announced this week that it would begin the international rollout of its new artificial intelligence-powered search feature, called AI Overviews. When billions of people search a range of topics from news to recipes to general knowledge questions, what they see first will now be an AI-generated summary. Google touted AI Overviews at its annual I/O developer conference as a way of delivering customers quick answers and simplifying the online search experience, but it also has another effect on the way that people engage with the internet: keeping users, and advertisers, on Google.com. It’s a new era in Google’s years-long quest for your attention. “Google will do the googling for you,” said Liz Reid, head of Google Search. While Google was once mostly a portal to reach other parts of the internet, it has spent years consolidating content and services to make itself into the web’s primary destination. Weather, flights, sports scores, stock prices, language translation, showtimes and a host of other information have gradually been incorporated into Google’s search page over the past 15 or so years. Finding that information no longer requires clicking through to another website. With AI Overviews, the rest of the internet may meet the same fate. Related: Google rolls out AI-generated, summarized search results in US Website owners are understandably concerned. Although Google’s demonstration gave the appearance that its AI could whisk its answers out of thin air, these overviews are built off content from news outlets, cooking blogs, product reviews and other articles that require human workers to write them. All of these sites rely on advertising revenue from people visiting their web pages, something that may no longer happen if users can get a summarized version of a site within seconds of searching. Google has tried to assuage publishers’ fears that users will no longer see their links or click through to their sites, with Reid stating during I/O that individual articles featured in AI Overviews get more traffic than if they were traditional web listings. The company has not mentioned whether it predicts overall search traffic will decline, however, and research firm Gartner predicts a 25% drop in traffic to websites from search engines by 2026 – a decrease that would be disastrous for most outlets and creators. AI Overviews are the culmination of a long line of products, going back almost two decades to the launch of its customized homepage, that have turned Google.com into its own self-contained online ecosystem. One of its first major advances in the amount of information Google would display on its search page came in 2012, with the debut of Knowledge Panels – boxes of information, usually taken from Wikipedia, that display basic information, photos and biographical details about a person or subject. Knowledge Panels expanded to the point that Google chief executive Sundar Pichai boasted in 2016 that they contained 70bn facts. Next came other services like stock prices and weather reports that would have previously required users to direct their attention to websites, causing alarm among outlets built around providing such information. When Google began featuring sports schedules on its page in 2013, TechCrunch ran an article titled “Google Embeds March Madness Bracket In Search, Because Screw Sports Sites”. As Google began to aggregate an increasing amount of information, concerns also grew around misinformation. Knowledge panels sometimes listed living persons as dead or automatically generated people’s job titles, regardless of why they might be public figures – leading to Google calling one of America’s worst mass murderers a “real estate investor”. AI Overviews have already started returning wrong answers.

Jim Cramer’s Latest Stock Picks in May 2024,18/5/2024 13:32,Fahad Saleem18 May 2024 at 6:32 am·6-min read,"Jim Cramer on Friday analyzed the market rally following the latest CPI data which showed inflation was easing in April. Cramer said bears are clearly fighting an ""uphill"" battle and unless they could get any clear sign that inflation is heating up, he expects the rally to continue. In another program last week Cramer said this market feels ""almost blasphemous"" to him because it's led by an ""outrageously bullish"" combination of stocks, many of which he believes don’t deserve to rally. Jim Cramer said that the NASDAQ, S&P 500 and the Dow recently touching record ""defies"" the conventional wisdom on ""what could happen"" at this stage of the business cycle.

Cramer said when you look at the stocks they tell you that market naysayers continuously warning about a hot economy, high CPI, budget deficit and low consumer sentiment are ""awful."" According to Cramer, the stocks are saying: ""Shut up and drive!"" Jim Cramer highlighted that in the past, when one group of stocks was going higher, usually its opposite camp declined. But this trend has been defied in the recent market rallies where apparently ""mutually exclusive"" group of stocks are surging at the same time — banks, tech, industrials, utilities, to name a few.

Should You Investigate Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) At US$176?,18/5/2024 12:00,editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St)18 May 2024 at 5:00 am·3-min read,"Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. The company is now trading at yearly-high levels following the recent surge in its share price. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s take a look at Alphabet’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.  Check out our latest analysis for Alphabet  The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to our valuation model. It’s trading around 19% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Alphabet today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $216.27, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Alphabet’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility. Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Alphabet's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 49%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value. Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in GOOGL’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value? Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on GOOGL, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.

"As the AI world gathers in Seoul, can an accelerating industry balance progress against safety?",18/5/2024 9:00,Dan Milmo and Alex Hern18 May 2024 at 2:00 am·7-min read,"This week, artificial intelligence caught up with the future – or at least Hollywood’s idea of it from a decade ago. “It feels like AI from the movies,” wrote the OpenAI chief executive, Sam Altman, of his latest system, an impressive virtual assistant. To underline his point he posted a single word on X – “her” – referring to the 2013 film starring Joaquin Phoenix as a man who falls in love with a futuristic version of Siri or Alexa, voiced by Scarlett Johansson. For some experts, that new AI, GPT-4o, will be an unsettling reminder of their concerns about the technology’s rapid advances, with a key OpenAI safety researcher leaving this week in a disagreement over the company’s direction. For others the GPT-4o release will be confirmation that innovation continues in a field promising benefits for all. Next week’s global AI summit in Seoul, attended by ministers, experts and tech executives, will hear both perspectives, as underlined by a safety report released before the meeting that referred to potential positives as well as numerous risks. The inaugural AI Safety Summit at Bletchley Park in the UK last year announced an international testing framework for AI models, after calls from some concerned experts and industry professionals for a six-month pause in development of powerful systems. There has been no pause. The Bletchley declaration signed by UK, US, EU, China and others hailed the “enormous global opportunities” from AI but also warned of its potential for causing “catastrophic” harm. It also secured a commitment from big tech firms including OpenAI, Google and Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta to cooperate with governments on testing their models before they are released. While the UK and US have established national AI safety institutes, the industry’s development of AI has continued. Big tech firms and others have all announced new AI products recently: OpenAI released GPT-4o (the o stands for “omni”) for free online; a day later, Google previewed a new AI assistant called Project Astra as well as updates to its Gemini model. Last month, Meta released new versions of its own AI model, Llama, and continues to offer them “open source”, meaning they are freely available to use and adapt; and in March, the AI startup Anthropic, formed by former OpenAI staff who disagreed with Altman’s approach, updated its Claude model and took the lead in capability on offer. Dan Ives, an analyst at the US stockbroker Wedbush Securities, estimates that the spending boom on generative AI – the general term for this latest method of building smart systems – will reach $100bn (£79bn) this year, part of a $1tn expenditure over the next decade. More landmark developments are looming: OpenAI is working on its next model, GPT-5, as well as a search engine; Google is preparing to release Astra and is rolling out AI-generated search queries outside the US; Microsoft is reportedly working on its own AI model and has hired the British entrepreneur Mustafa Suleyman to oversee a new AI division; Apple is reportedly in talks with OpenAI to put ChatGPT in its smartphones; and billions of dollars of AI investment is being poured into tech firms of all sizes. Hardware startups such as Humane and Rabbit are racing to build the AI-powered replacement for the smartphone, while others are experimenting with how much of one person’s life can be used to teach an AI. The US-based startup Rewind is marketing a product that records every action you ever take on your computer screen, training an AI system to know your life in intricate detail. Coming soon, it is a lapel-worn mic and camera so that it can even learn from what goes on when you’re offline. Niamh Burns, a senior analyst at Enders Analysis, says there will be a stream of new products as companies, backed by multibillion-dollar investments, try to win over consumers. “We’re going to keep seeing these flashy releases, because the tech is new and exciting, and because the actual consumer use case hasn’t been landed on. New models and even just new interfaces – simply put, things to do with the models – need to be released until something sticks from a user perspective,” she says.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-world-gathers-seoul-accelerating-090003850.html,GOOG
The 'Magnificent 7' term needs to be retired after Q1 earnings: Goldman Sachs,18/5/2024 5:39,Investing.com17 May 2024 at 10:39 pm·1-min read,"Goldman Sachs has observed a significant shift among the top technology companies, often dubbed the ""Magnificent 7,"" following their first-quarter results. Collectively, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)., Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc., Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)., Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. saw their profits increase by 48% year-over-year. This growth was supported by a 14% increase in sales and a margin expansion of 521 basis points, bringing the aggregate margin to 22.8%. However, this overall performance conceals the varying fortunes of the individual companies, the analysis showed. Meta Platforms, Alphabet, and Amazon outperformed expectations with sales growth of 27%, 15%, and 13% respectively, leading to year-to-date share price increases of 34%, 25%, and 21%. These gains reflect a stronger market performance for these companies relative to some of their peers. In stark contrast, Apple's sales saw a 4% decline, while Tesla experienced a 9% drop in revenues. Consequently, their stock prices have been impacted, with Apple's shares dipping by 1% and Tesla's plummeting by 30%. This downturn has led to Tesla's ranking falling to the 12th largest stock in the S&P 500 index. ""The sobriquet “Magnificent 7” needs to be retired following 1Q results,"" Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note. The report added that wide dispersion in performance highlights the diverse challenges and opportunities faced by these industry leaders.

Alphabet (GOOG) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons Why,17/5/2024 16:45,Zacks Equity Research17 May 2024 at 9:45 am·3-min read,"Growth stocks are attractive to many investors, as above-average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock. In addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end. However, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects. Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank. Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this company a great growth pick right now. Earnings Growth Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration. While the historical EPS growth rate for Alphabet is 23.4%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 31.8% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 29.6%.

AI's Insatiable Energy Needs Boost Uranium ETFs,17/5/2024 16:43,Neena Mishra17 May 2024 at 9:43 am·1-min read,"Tech giants Microsoft MSFT, Google's parent Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, and Meta META have reported massive investments in artificial intelligence and cloud computing in their latest earnings reports. The AI boom has driven a surge in demand for data center capacity to handle AI workloads and store the vast amounts of data they require. Data centers are energy-intensive, and AI applications consume even more energy than traditional computing. Many tech giants have pledged to use renewable energy to power their data centers, driven by sustainability goals. And they are increasingly exploring nuclear energy for their power needs. Governments around the world have also recognized that nuclear energy might be one of their key options in achieving their net-zero emissions targets. Uranium, mainly used in nuclear power plants, is one of the most carbon-free ways to generate electricity. However, nuclear energy currently accounts for only about 10% of global electricity generation and about 20% in developed countries, including the US. While demand for uranium continues to rise, supply faces many challenges. Expanding the uranium supply will take a long time. President Biden yesterday signed a bill banning the import of Russian enriched uranium, which includes some waivers allowing imports until 2028 if no alternative source is found. The bill allocates about $2.7 billion to build up domestic uranium supplies.

Does Reddit's (RDDT) OpenAI Partnership Make It Worth Buying?,17/5/2024 13:53,Aniruddha Ganguly17 May 2024 at 6:53 am·4-min read,"Reddit RDDT shares jumped 11.74% in after-hours trading on May 16, following the announcement of its partnership with Microsoft MSFT-backed OpenAI.The deal will bring Reddit content to OpenAI’s ChatGPT and other products and, at the same time, will help the social media company incorporate new AI-powered features into its forums. OpenAI will also become Reddit’s advertising partner.Since its initial public offering in March, Reddit shares have gained 22.6%, outperforming the Zacks Internet Software industry and the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector. Reddit’s huge data trove makes it an invaluable source for big techs like Alphabet GOOGL division Google, Amazon AMZN and Microsoft for training their large language models (LLMs). LLMs form the base of Generative AI applications.Generative AI and AI-related startups like OpenAI have attracted close to $50 billion in investments since 2023, affirming the growing interest in the technology and its applications. Microsoft invested close to $13 billion in OpenAI as it sought to gain a front seat in the startup’s AI innovations. Another startup, Anthropic, raised close to $2 billion and $4 billion from investors led by Alphabet’s division Google and Amazon, respectively, as it sought a valuation of close to $30 billion.OpenAI’s GPT-4, Anthropic’s Claude 3 Opus, and Google DeepMind’s Gemini Ultra are the three most capable tools currently available in the Generative AI domain. Reddit Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Reddit Inc. Quote   However, OpenAI and Anthropic are facing increasing competition from their original backers — Microsoft, Amazon and Google, respectively — as these big techs plan to build their own LLMs primarily because these are cheaper to build in-house and they can exercise more control on how to use the models. The OpenAI deal is expected to give them a glimpse of the potency of RDDT’s data in training their models.Reddit’s partnership with Google, which involves training the latter’s LLMs, has been a game changer. An expanded partnership in February this year made it easier for users to find, discover and engage in content and communities on Reddit that are most relevant to them.RDDT is already benefiting from growing data licensing deals as other revenues surged more than 450% year over year to $20 million in the first quarter of 2024. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s prospects are supported by strong ad revenue growth expectations driven by an expanding user base. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Reddit currently has a Zacks Momentum Score of A, which makes it further attractive. Google is playing an important role in expanding its user base as it is getting better at displaying RDDT’s content. In first-quarter 2024, Daily Active Uniques (“DAUq”) increased 37% year over year to 82.7 million. Logged-in DAUq: Global, which RDDT considers as the core metrics of the business, jumped 27% year over year to 43.1 million in the reported quarter.Reddit’s focus on making the platform faster and more user-friendly is noteworthy. It continues to invest in AI and machine learning to improve relevance, engagement and moderation. RDDT plans to deploy its own trained LLMs to improve moderation. These initiatives are expected to drive user engagement.Reddit’s plan to monetize its platform through the launch of a revamped version of user awards and Reddit Gold (its virtual currency) bodes well for its future prospects.Its focus on reducing campaign setup time for self-serve and small and medium businesses (SMBs), as well as the launch of free formats, which provide advertisers with a versatile and creative format to drive deeper engagement with users, is expected to drive ad revenues.Reddit Pro, a free suite of AI-powered insights and tools, is currently in beta with more than 1000 businesses, including Taco Bell, Wendy’s, NFL, the Wall Street Journal, as well as several SMBs. Shopping also remains on the horizon, with RDDT launching shopping ads and testing dynamic product ads. Reddit’s user-friendly and advertiser-friendly focus is a key catalyst. Upcoming user interface improvements, better on-platform search capabilities and monetization plans provide strong growth opportunities. RDDT plans to grow revenues twice as fast as cost growth over the long term, which surely makes the stock attractive for investors at its current level.

5 Must-Buy High-Flying U.S. Giants on Favorable Economic Data,17/5/2024 12:16,Nalak Das17 May 2024 at 5:16 am·6-min read,"On May 15, U.S. stock markets soared following the release of two key economic data. Market participants’ confidence in risky assets like equities was boosted as expectations of the first reduction in the Fed fund rate in September heightened. The Department of Labor reported that the consumer price index (CPI) for the month of April rose 0.3% month-over-month, below the consensus estimate and March’s reading of 0.4%. Year over year, CPI increased 3.4%, in line with expectations. The core CPI (excluding volatile food and energy items) rose 0.3% month-over-month in April, after rising 0.4% in the previous three months. April’s data showed the smallest monthly increase since December 2023. Year over year, core CPI increased 3.6%, marking the lowest monthly increase since April 2021. The Department of Commerce reported that retail sales in April remained flat month over month, missing the consensus estimate of a rise of 0.4%. The reading for March was also revised downward to 0.6% from 0.7% reported earlier. However, year over year, retail sales increased 3% in April. Core retail sales (excluding auto) rose 0.2% month over month in April, in line with the consensus estimate. The metric for March was revised downward to 0.9% from 1.1% reported earlier. The Department of Commerce reported that U.S. GDP grew at a 1.6% annualized rate in first-quarter 2024, well below the consensus estimate of 2.5%. Moreover, the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) reported that both manufacturing and services PMIs (purchasing managers’ index) contracted in April. Weak retail sales and lower-than-expected CPI data are also in line with this trend. Following the release of CPI and retail sales data, the CME FedWatch shows a 73.2% probability that the Fed will reduce the benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points in September. The interest rate derivative tool is also showing a 94.5% probability that the central bank will reduce the interest rate by at least 50 basis points by the end of 2024.

Time for Cloud ETFs on Earnings Strength & Promising Growth?,17/5/2024 12:00,Sanghamitra Saha17 May 2024 at 5:00 am·3-min read,"Cloud computing has been at the forefront of the growth in technology for the past few years, offering efficient solutions for businesses and consumers. The global cloud computing market is expected to grow from $626.4 billion in 2023 to $1.27 billion by 2028 at a CAGR of 15.1%, per MarketsandMarkets. The widespread adoption of remote work and e-commerce has continued to fuel the need for scalable and reliable cloud solutions. Moreover, advancements in cloud technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and cybersecurity enhancements, have expanded the use cases for cloud services, attracting a broader customer base. The global cloud computing market is led by three mega cloud service providers — Microsoft, Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services. The total cloud infrastructure market was worth $76 billion worldwide at the end of Q1 of 2024, which marked a year-over-year rise of 21%. According to recent data from Synergy Research Group cited on CRN, AWS, Microsoft and Google collectively managed a 67% share of the $76 billion global cloud infrastructure services market in the first quarter of 2024. Google-parent Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT and Amazon AMZN recently reported their quarterly financial cloud numbers for the first quarter of 2024. Each company logged record quarterly cloud sales thanks to double-digit growth rates. Combined, these three cloud leaders generated more than $61 billion in total sales in the first quarter of 2024. Their cloud units, in fact, boosted total revenue growth as clients are increasingly adopting AI services. Growth rates are rebounding from the relative lows seen through most of 2023. Individually, Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud business generated $26.7 billion in total sales (up 21% year over year) during the quarter, meaning Microsoft’s cloud group now has a run rate of $107 billion. AWS generated just over $25 billion in revenues (up 17% year over year). This means Amazon’s cloud business now has an annual run rate of $100 billion. Google Cloud reported total sales of $9.6 billion (up 28% year over year). This shows that Alphabet’s cloud business currently has an annual run rate of $38.4 billion. In terms of global market share, AWS is leading (with a 31% share), followed by Microsoft (25%) and Google (11%). Other cloud market-share leaders of the first quarter included Alibaba BABA at 4% market share and Salesforce CRM at 3% cloud share.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/time-cloud-etfs-earnings-strength-120000396.html,GOOG

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Alphabet GOOGL, Datadog DDOG, Garmin GRMN, Salesforce CRM and CrowdStrike CRWD. Wall Street witnesses a new big bull as inflation resumes a downward trend. This is evident from the latest Consumer Price Index (“CPI”) report released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which shows that U.S. consumer prices increased less than expected in April 2024. The CPI rose 0.3% over the previous month and 3.4% over the prior year in April. This indicates a deceleration from March 2024, in which CPI grew 3.5%. Economists are of the view that price pressure will be down gradually and, thus, inflation will eventually incline toward the Federal Reserve’s target of 2%. This, in turn, has raised hopes of investors regarding interest rate cuts by the Fed in September 2024. Cooling inflation has pushed the stocks to record highs. The S&P 500 index closed at $5,308.15 on Wednesday, exceeding the mark of $5,300 for the first time. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite surged 1.4%, closing at $16,742.39, whereas the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached the $40,000 milestone, closing at $39,908 yesterday. Investors looking for growth opportunities should consider investing in technology stocks in the current scenario. The likelihood of interest rate cuts bodes well for growth-oriented tech stocks. Lower interest rates are expected to boost cash inflows, especially free cash flows in the future, which remains crucial for growth-seeking tech stocks. Free cash flows help companies in pursuing acquisitions and investments in technical advancements. Lower interest rates will reduce the cost of borrowings of the technology companies, which will likely bolster their growth prospects. In addition, lower inflation will enable enterprises to sign multi-year agreements, which, in turn, will help technology companies win several valuable deals. The growing proliferation of generative AI technology remains a major positive for the technology sector. The ability to interact with humans, respond to questions asked in various languages, generate content, classify data and perform coding on the back of large language models (LLM) are bolstering the adoption of generative AI-backed chatbots. Increasing adoption of Machine Learning, Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality devices, quantum computing and cloud computing have been contributing well to the performances of the technology companies. Growing demand for data centers, driven by the need for increasing cloud capacity to support AI-related workloads, is acting as a tailwind. Apart from his, strong momentum across customer relationship software, employee management tools, natural language processing tools, time tracking tools and cyber security software is highly benefiting the software companies.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-analyst-blog-highlights-alphabet-105800262.html,GOOG
Netflix's NFL deal highlights streamer's 'natural evolution' as sports rights take center stage,19/5/2024 12:16,Alexandra Canal·Senior ReporterUpdated 19 May 2024 at 5:16 am·4-min read,"Netflix's (NFLX) surprise three-season deal with the NFL marks a major shift for the streaming giant, which has historically avoided traditional live sports investments. As part of the deal, the platform will stream two Christmas Day games: the Pittsburgh Steelers taking on the Kansas City Chiefs, followed by a matchup between the Baltimore Ravens and Houston Texans. Some on Wall Street view the move as more of an experiment for Netflix, with streaming platforms pressured to expand their offerings, especially amid the recent introduction of advertising tiers. ""I think this is much more about testing the waters, learning how to do advertising inside of sports,"" Citi analyst Jason Bazinet told Yahoo Finance, arguing the NFL won't necessarily help the streamer retain subscribers over the long term. ""Down the road, [Netflix will] presumably bid on more sports rights and do more advertising,"" he surmised. ""I think it's a good thing. It's just a natural evolution of the business."" The deal comes as the NFL has been adding more streaming services as media partners. The list also includes Amazon's Prime Video (AMZN) and Comcast's Peacock (CMCSA). And Google's YouTube TV (GOOG, GOOGL) has the exclusive rights to NFL Sunday Ticket, which makes out-of-market games available to fans nationwide. JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth wrote in a note to clients that he believes the games will help offer a boost to Netflix's ad tier and enable the company to ""actively promote"" its own content during the games. Netflix — which will reportedly pay less than $150 million per game, according to Bloomberg — will also bring large global distribution to the NFL, according to Anmuth. ""Last year’s 3 NFL Christmas Day games ranked among the top 25 most viewed TV programs in 2023. With the partnership spanning 3 years, we believe NFLX could deepen its relationship with the NFL, especially as the league looks to further diversify its distribution strategy & we would expect more live sports over time,"" he wrote. Jefferies agreed, writing in a research note following the news, ""We are positive on the NFL deal, which we believe will create a compelling value proposition for NFLX's emerging ad business.""",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/netflixs-nfl-deal-highlights-streamers-natural-evolution-as-sports-rights-take-center-stage-080037882.html,GOOG
"Google seeks non-jury trial in US ad tech lawsuit, filing says",17/5/2024 1:02,Reuters16 May 2024 at 6:02 pm·1-min read,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Alphabet's Google in a court filing on Thursday is seeking a non-jury trial in the U.S. Justice Department's lawsuit accusing the advertising and search giant of anticompetitive practices in the online advertising marketplace. The Justice Department, which filed the advertising lawsuit in January 2023, alleged the company has abused its dominance of the digital advertising business and argued that it should be forced to sell its ad manager suite. Google said the Justice Department's request for a jury trial breaks ""with all historical precedent"" and noted the department itself has said the technical nature might be difficult for a prospective juror to understand. The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Google’s online advertising network, which includes ad manager, brought in 12% of the company’s revenue in 2021 and also plays a vital role in the search engine and cloud company's overall sales. Google has said the Justice Department's case went ""beyond the boundaries of antitrust law,"" saying it does not regulate the internet company's conduct at issue.

"Google wants judge, not jury, to decide upcoming antitrust case in Virginia",17/5/2024 13:49,MATTHEW BARAKATUpdated 17 May 2024 at 6:49 am·3-min read,"Google on Thursday asked that a judge, rather than a jury, decide whether it violated U.S. antitrust laws by building a monopoly on the technology that powers online advertising. To bolster its case, the tech giant wrote a multimillion-dollar check to the U.S. government that it says renders moot the government's best argument for demanding a jury trial. The antitrust case set to go before a jury in Alexandria, Virginia, in September is one of two major lawsuits the Justice Department has brought against Google. While the Virginia case focuses on advertising technology, an ongoing case in the District of Columbia focuses on Google's dominance as a search engine. Both sides in the D.C. case have presented evidence and made closing arguments. A judge there will decide whether Google violated the law. Google wants a judge to decide the merits of the case in Virginia, as well. The company argues in court papers filed Thursday that it's unprecedented for a jury to decide a federal antitrust case brought by the government. It says that this case in particular involves ""a complicated, intricate technology ecosystem, which DOJ has acknowledged to this Court is ‘highly technical, often abstract, and outside the everyday knowledge of most prospective jurors.’” A Department of Justice spokesperson did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment Thursday evening. Google, based in Mountain View, California, makes two primary arguments for striking the government's demand for a jury trial. For starters, Google argues that the constitutional right to a jury trial does not apply to a civil suit brought by the government. The right to a jury trial, based in the Bill of Rights, “protects citizens against the federal government, not the other way around,” Google's lawyers write in their court filing. The company acknowledges in the court papers, though, that the Justice Department has a stronger argument for demanding a jury in a case where it seeks monetary damages, as opposed to merely seeking equitable relief, like forcing Google to sell off parts of its advertising technology. In the Virginia case, the Department of Justice seeks monetary damages on behalf of federal agencies, including the Army, that it says were harmed by Google's monopolistic practices and overpaid for online ads that they purchased.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/google-wants-judge-not-jury-223727696.html,GOOG

The first quarter of 2024 reveals a strategic recalibration towards physical commodities and renewable energy, while Burry shifted away from some tech giants. The total market value of Scion's 13F securities increased from $94.6 million to $103.49 million. The fund’s activity included five new purchases, additions to 11 existing positions, and complete sell-offs of 14 stocks.

Leading the charge is the Sprott Physical Gold Trust ETV (NYSE:PHYS), with Scion increasing its position by $7.62 million, marking a 7.37% change in the portfolio. This substantial investment highlights Burry's confidence in gold as a hedge against economic uncertainty. The aforementioned gold fund has delivered a 16% return year to date, outperforming the broader stock market, as tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), which rose by 12%. Next in line is Cigna Holding Co (NYSE:CL), where Scion increased its stake by $7.26 million, representing a 7.02% portfolio change.

Last week, the British energy company’s electric vehicle charging unit announced plans to acquire Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) supercharging sites in the US as part of its expansion efforts.

"Google, Apple, and Microsoft make their products friendlier to users with disabilities",16/5/2024 14:47,David Meyer16 May 2024 at 7:47 am·3-min read,"It’s Global Accessibility Awareness Day today, and Big Tech firms have accordingly issued a flurry of announcements about how they’ll make their products friendlier to people whose use of devices is hindered by disabilities. Most coverage of Google’s I/O developer event this week may have focused on its generative AI news, but the company also announced an expansion of Project Gameface to the Android platform. Google announced that project last year—it’s an open-source, hands-free gaming “mouse” that uses the webcam to capture the gamer’s head movements and facial gestures, translating them into cursor movements via the magic of machine learning. Now Google is open-sourcing more of the code so developers can make better Android accessibility apps. Gaming may have been the inspiration for Project Gameface—specifically, the needs of a gaming streamer named Lance Carr, who has muscular dystrophy—but the applications clearly go far beyond, with Google promising use cases in educational and work settings too. In a similar vein, Apple yesterday also announced an upcoming iPhone and iPad feature called Eye Tracking. This does what the name suggests, giving users a way to navigate through and activate the elements of an app, just by letting the front-facing camera track their eye movements. Apple also revealed other accessibility features that will be coming soon: Music Haptics, which will help deaf or hard-of-hearing iPhone users experience music with the aid of “taps, textures, and refined vibrations”; Vocal Shortcuts, which will let users trigger complex tasks by uttering simple sounds; and a bunch of new accessibility features specific to the CarPlay and visionOS environments. Meanwhile, on the intriguing-hardware front, we have Microsoft’s announcement yesterday of the Proteus controller for Xbox and PC gamers. Designed by peripherals startup ByoWave, the Proteus is a kit comprising “snap and play” parts that let people customize a wireless controller according to their needs. There’s a “mother cube” that serves as the controller’s brain, a cube features the directional pad, a piece with a mini control stick, another two providing left and right triggers, and so on. There are many possible configurations, from traditional controller layouts to wand-like columns and tabletop-friendly rectangles. Preorders are open now, with the kit ($255 to first-comers, $299 thereafter) shipping in the fall. Microsoft also used the occasion of Global Accessibility Awareness Day to promise fixes for what some gamers with disabilities experienced from a major change that the company made last November when it started blocking the use of unauthorized accessories with the Xbox console. This has been an issue for those who had put together custom controller setups to fit their unique requirements, with equipment coming from small specialist manufacturers that aren’t official Microsoft licensees. Part of Microsoft’s solution is for those manufacturers to get in touch and make their controllers official, but the company is also updating its own Adaptive Controller, which the Xbox always accepts, to expand support for more accessories. The $99 Adaptive Controller is a clever piece of gear that includes some built-in controller functionality of its own, but more importantly acts as a hub for specialized equipment, such as switches that are controlled by biting, sipping, and puffing with the mouth, or with one's feet. “We appreciate and acknowledge that gaming with a disability is highly individualistic, and the solution for one may not be the solution for all,” the company said.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/google-apple-microsoft-products-friendlier-144738151.html,GOOG

This, in turn, has raised hopes of investors regarding interest rate cuts by the Fed in September 2024.Cooling inflation has pushed the stocks to record highs. The S&P 500 index closed at $5,308.15 on Wednesday, exceeding the mark of $5,300 for the first time. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite surged 1.4%, closing at $16,742.39, whereas the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached the $40,000 milestone, closing at $39,908 yesterday.  Investors looking for growth opportunities should consider investing in technology stocks in the current scenario. The likelihood of interest rate cuts bodes well for growth-oriented tech stocks. Lower interest rates are expected to boost cash inflows, especially free cash flows in the future, which remains crucial for growth-seeking tech stocks. Free cash flows help companies in pursuing acquisitions and investments in technical advancements.Lower interest rates will reduce the cost of borrowings of the technology companies, which will likely bolster their growth prospects.In addition, lower inflation will enable enterprises to sign multi-year agreements, which, in turn, will help technology companies win several valuable deals. The growing proliferation of generative AI technology remains a major positive for the technology sector. The ability to interact with humans, respond to questions asked in various languages, generate content, classify data and perform coding on the back of large language models (LLM) are bolstering the adoption of generative AI-backed chatbots.Increasing adoption of Machine Learning, Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality devices, quantum computing and cloud computing have been contributing well to the performances of the technology companies.Growing demand for data centers, driven by the need for increasing cloud capacity to support AI-related workloads, is acting as a tailwind. Apart from his, strong momentum across customer relationship software, employee management tools, natural language processing tools, time tracking tools and cyber security software is highly benefiting the software companies.Technical advancements in Internet infrastructure and the accelerated deployment of 5G technology worldwide are tailwinds. IoT-supported industrial automation, rising PC shipment andgrowing demand for smart electric appliances, wearables, electric vehicles and drones are other positives.Given this booming scenario, it is prudent for investors to place bets on tech companies such as Alphabet GOOGL, Datadog DDOG, Garmin GRMN, Salesforce CRM and CrowdStrike CRWD for superb returns.These stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and have a Growth Score of A or B, a combination that offers the best opportunities in the growth investing space.   Image Source: Zacks Investment Research   Alphabet is benefiting from growing generative AI capabilities.

Here's what 10 analysts have to say about Netflix ad tier,16/5/2024 13:55,Investing.com16 May 2024 at 6:55 am·2-min read,"Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) announced Wednesday that it will team up with The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Display&Video 360, and ad-tech firm Magnite to accelerate automated ad buying. The company also made several other announcements as part of its Upfront 2024 press release. Here's how Wall Street analysts reacted: BMO Capital: ""Reiterate Outperform for TTD, our top SMID-cap pick, as a Netflix CTV demand partnership reinforces our view that TTD is best-positioned against a massive $150B linear TV opportunity shift towards connected TV."" Truist: ""These partnerships were bound to happen in our view given Netflix's evolving ad platform, which is now at the point where it can scale materially with the scaling of users for its AVOD service."" KeyBanc: ""As Netflix deepens its ad capabilities, we believe this could help support >10% annual revenue growth in 2025E and beyond."" JPMorgan: ""NFLX announced that it will build an in-house ad tech platform by the end of 2025&expand its sales partnerships this summer to TTD, Google's Display&Video 360,&Magnite, in addition to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Xandr. We believe today's announcements show solid progress in the multi-year journey toward a scaled advertising tier,&highlight NFLX˖s growing focus on differentiated live content."" Citi: ""Netflix broadening its ad tech partners has been anticipated for some time, and with TTD's leadership in decisioned programmatic CTV, it was a clear partner choice. That said, with Netflix's premier positioning in CTV, our view is this is positive for TTD."" Jefferies: ""NFLX's decision to onboard new programmatic partners (e.g., TTD, GOOG, MGNI) represents a faster-than-expected transition of Connected TV ad sales from direct deals into biddable auctions. We believe this validates our view that there will be fewer Walled Gardens in CTV than there are in Search/Social."" UBS: ""Along with the recent WWE deal, we believe the addition of NFL rights provide another lever to drive engagement, enhance pricing power and scale the company's ad business (while presenting another source of leakage for marquee programming out the traditional TV ecosystem)."" Guggenheim: ""Netflix will stream at least one NFL game globally on Christmas Day for the next three years, the streaming giant announced Wednesday, marking the company's biggest bet on live sports yet.""",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-10-analysts-netflix-ad-135506086.html,GOOG

Here's How Much You'd Have If You Invested $1000 in Alphabet a Decade Ago,16/5/2024 12:30,Zacks Equity Research16 May 2024 at 5:30 am·4-min read,"How much a stock's price changes over time is a significant driver for most investors. Not only can price performance impact your portfolio, but it can help you compare investment results across sectors and industries as well. FOMO, or the fear of missing out, also plays a role in investing, particularly with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks. What if you'd invested in Alphabet (GOOGL) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to GOOGL for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today? Alphabet's Business In-Depth With that in mind, let's take a look at Alphabet's main business drivers. Alphabet is one of the most innovative companies in the modern technological age. Over the last few years, the company has evolved from primarily being a search-engine provider to cloud computing, ad-based video and music streaming, autonomous vehicles, healthcare providers and others. In the online search arena, Google has a monopoly with more than 94% of the online search volume and market. Over the years, the company has witnessed increase in search queries, resulting from ongoing growth in user adoption and usage, primarily on mobile devices, continued growth in advertiser activity, and improvements in ad formats.The company is gaining market share in the cloud-computing, driven by continued strength in Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace.Alphabet also enjoys a dominant position in the autonomous vehicles market, thanks to Waymo’s relentless efforts. In addition, it has bolstered its footprint in the healthcare industry with its life science division, Verily. The company has also become a renowned name in the world of entertainment on the back of YouTube.Alphabet is also known as the maker of smartwatches (Pixel Watch), laptops and tablets (Chromebooks), and smart home products (Google Nest).Alphabet, headquartered in Mountain View, CA, runs several businesses, most of which come under Google, which reports under two segments — Google Services and Google Cloud. The non-Google businesses fall under the Other Bets segment.Total revenues were $307.4 billion in 2023, up 9% from 2022. Google Services, Google Cloud and Other Bets generated 88.7%, 10.8% and 0.5% of total revenues, respectively.The Google Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, devices, Gmail, Google Drive, Google Maps, Google Photos, Google Play, Search, and YouTube. The segment generates revenues primarily from performance and brand advertising, which remains crucial for the overall business. Ad revenues accounted for 77.4% of the total revenues in 2023.Google Cloud is comprised of Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace. Its key capabilities include AI infrastructure, database and analytics, collaboration tools, cybersecurity and generative AI.Other Bets is a combination of multiple businesses, generating revenues primarily from the sale of healthcare-related and internet services. Bottom Line While anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in Alphabet ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today. A $1000 investment made in May 2014 would be worth $6,520.64, or a 552.06% gain, as of May 16, 2024, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases. The S&P 500 rose 183.73% and the price of gold increased 75.57% over the same time frame in comparison.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-much-youd-invested-1000-123005690.html,GOOG
"In a single night, self-driving startup Cruise went from sizzling startup to cautionary tale. Here’s what really happened—and how GM is scrambling to save its $10B bet",16/5/2024 12:00,Jessica Mathews16 May 2024 at 5:00 am·28-min read,"October 2 was a quiet night on the streets of San Francisco. It was moderately cloudy, and Fleet Week activities had just begun at Sunset Library. But in the Tenderloin neighborhood, at 9:29pm, a pedestrian stepped out into the street, crossing 5th and Market, and was struck by a green Nissan Sentra sedan. What happened next would ripple all the way through one of the largest corporations on earth—GM. Because after the woman was struck the first time, “Panini”—one of the self-driving robo-taxis in Cruise’s fleet that had been out on the streets for about a year and a half—ran over her, stopped, then dragged the woman for 20 feet as it tried to pull over. Within seconds of the initial impact, Cruise’s control room in Scottsdale, Az.—where hourly agents monitored Cruise’s fleet 24 hours a day in cubicles fitted with three computer screens—was looped in. By the time a live three-second video of the incident transmitted onto the computer screens in front of Cruise’s remote assistance agents, the car had already incorrectly labeled the incident as a side collision and begun to pull over, unaware it was dragging a human body beneath its wheels. An exhaustive internal investigation reconstructed nearly every detail of the accident, but it couldn’t clear up exactly what Cruise’s remote assistance team saw that evening. One thing is certain: The incident was the most serious in Cruise’s history, and it immediately thrust the robo-taxi company and its 80% owner, General Motors, into a spiral of federal scrutiny and investigations as well as public outrage and condemnation. Before the end of October 2023, regulators were alleging that Cruise had withheld important details of the incident from them. California’s Department of Motor Vehicles had rescinded Cruise’s operational permit, leading Cruise to voluntarily pull its vehicles off the streets across the U.S. GM—which had largely let the company run independently, despite its close communication with senior leadership and operations—swept in to replace nearly all of Cruise’s management, shuffle up its board, and lay off nearly a quarter of its almost 4,000 employees in a bid to salvage Cruise’s reputation and preserve the more than $10 billion that GM has plowed into the company over the last eight years. Cruise—once a crown jewel within General Motors CEO and Cruise Chair Mary Barra’s broader strategy to rival electric competitor Tesla—suddenly had become an outsized liability, just as General Motors was simultaneously trying to manage the six-week union strike by workers of the Big Three U.S. automakers that was threatening its business. Those labor strikes were unprecedented, but the revelations around Cruise’s back-and-forth with regulators were also unnerving GM shareholders. As a financial analyst put it during GM’s first earnings call that mentioned Cruise’s permit being revoked, the company's handling of the whole debacle was very “un-GM like.” “I agree with you,” Barra responded. “It was uncharacteristic, and it definitely is something that we're working to manage well,” she said. But unlike a startup that implodes then closes its doors, GM is unfurling the full force of a Fortune 500 giant to resuscitate the project. Whereas GM had previously taken more of a backseat approach with Cruise, it is now intimately hands-on in its subsidiary’s day-to-day—and in the sensitive task of rolling Cruise robo-taxis back onto the streets. To report this story, Fortune spoke with eleven former Cruise employees or contract workers, in addition to Cruise investors, analysts, and San Francisco politicians. Fortune also interviewed Cruise’s newly-appointed Chief Safety Officer, Steve Kenner. What is clear? The moves GM and Cruise’s new leadership team make next will be a roadmap of how a giant corporation can rescue an innovative startup—or be driven off course trying to save it. Two years ago, General Motors CEO Mary Barra, sporting a black leather jacket, peered into the window of white and orange Chevvy Bolt that was pulling up to the curb to pick her up—no driver in sight. “Oh my gosh. This is incredible,” Barra said after sliding into the back seat of the Cruise robo-taxi, known by Cruise staffers as “Tostada.” Barra was sitting next to Kyle Vogt, cofounder of Cruise and its then-president and Chief Technology Officer. “It’s too bad that we have to wear masks though, because I can’t stop smiling,” Barra said. The video, which Barra posted on her LinkedIn two years ago, showed her taking her first Cruise ride, though she had already been talking up its technology for years—ever since General Motors had scooped up a majority of the startup’s shares in March 2016, and two years later when she became Chair of its board. The acquisition, which was for a combination of cash and GM equity, put the fledgling company at $1 billion when it was still just three years old and cemented Vogt as a two-time billion-dollar exit founder—and made him and Cruise cofounder Dan Kan the youngest-ever senior directors at General Motors.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/single-night-self-driving-startup-120000619.html,GOOG
"Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Microsoft, Alphabet, Nvidia and Arista Networks",16/5/2024 9:52,Zacks Equity Research16 May 2024 at 2:52 am·6-min read,"Chicago, IL – May 16, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Nvidia NVDA and Arista Networks ANET. Yes, I know the last year has been all AI every day, but this theme is still early days. Exciting new products built from generative AI models are just beginning to come to market and will continue to change the way we interact with technology. Just this week there were two significant releases from both Microsoft’s, OpenAI and Alphabet. Additionally, now that broad markets have traded sideways for the better part of two months, energy has been built for a major breakout in the leading names. These product releases should be a valuable catalyst for the next big rally. OpenAI introduced the newest iteration of their primary AI model, GPT-4o. The demonstrations of GPT-4o were extremely impressive, with one video showing the AI model interacting with and tutoring a young boy on his math homework. The GPT, young boy and father were all in conversation with each other, and the GPT helped him through the process in a supportive and logical way. It was really something, and I recommend those interested seek out some of the most recent demonstrations released online. Then, at Google I/O, Alphabet’s annual developer conference, the company introduced its newest AI enabled “Agents,” built throughout its platforms. This product is built on Gemini, Alphabet’s response to OpenAI’s GPT. In one demo, the presenter wanted to return a pair of shoes they bought online. They took a picture of them, and said to the agent, “I want to return these shoes, they don’t fit.” Gemini proceeded to find the order info in Gmail, fill out a return form, and scheduled a pickup from UPS. It really functioned like a personal assistant. The presentation also showed Gemini agents planning detailed trips catered to specific interests, summarizing long email chains, and working across multiple external websites to really simplify workflow. Again, I recommend those interested go watch the demo videos.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-investment-ideas-feature-highlights-095200168.html,GOOG
D.C. is testing its Big Tech antitrust campaign far from D.C.,16/5/2024 8:00,Alexis Keenan·Reporter16 May 2024 at 1:00 am·6-min read,"The Biden administration is testing its antitrust push far from Washington as it seeks to unwind the dominance of Big Tech. No longer is the nation’s capital the go-to trial venue of choice for the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission as they file competition challenges against the biggest names in Silicon Valley. Instead, it’s New Jersey where the government chose to sue Apple (AAPL). Or California, where it challenged Microsoft (MSFT). Or the state of Washington, where it confronted Amazon (AMZN). Or Virginia, where it filed a second antitrust suit against Google (GOOG, GOOGL). ""They’re clearly filing these tech cases in different jurisdictions where the law is less developed,"" said Douglas Ross, a professor of antitrust at the University of Washington School of Law. ""And they're doing it for a reason."" A variety of strategies could explain the multi-jurisdictional approach, according to antitrust lawyers. Prosecutors could be targeting appeals courts with case law more favorable to their legal theories, since all of the district courts selected by Biden’s FTC and DOJ report to different courts of appeals. The government could also be weighing the speed of a court in handling litigation and the convenience to anticipated witnesses, said Juan Arteaga, a partner with Crowell & Moring’s antitrust litigation division. It’s also possible, he added, that government officials may want to showcase vigorous anticompetitive enforcement to the rest of the country. ""I think the current leadership team and the DOJ antitrust division have really made it a point to try to take antitrust enforcement out of the D.C. bubble,"" Arteaga said. Ross is more skeptical of a strategy that seeks out jurisdictions where judges have less antitrust experience and fewer controlling antitrust cases are on the books.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/dc-is-testing-its-big-tech-antitrust-campaign-far-from-dc-080007707.html,GOOG
Turkish competition board fines Google over failure to comply with regulation,16/5/2024 7:40,Reuters16 May 2024 at 12:40 am·1-min read,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - The Turkish competition authority said on Thursday that it decided to fine Google over its failure to fulfil obligations regarding a part of its local search services.

(Reporting by Birsen Altayli; Writing by Ezgi Erkoyun; Editing by Daren Butler) Chinese EV makers are pushing back against the idea that their success in making affordable cars is due to state help. SINGAPORE/BEIJING (Reuters) -Two Chinese chipmakers are in the early stages of producing high bandwidth memory (HBM) semiconductors used in artificial intelligence chipsets, according to sources and documents.  The progress in HBM - even if only in older versions of HBM - represents a major step forward in China's efforts to reduce its reliance on foreign suppliers amid tensions with Washington that have led to restrictions on U.S. exports of advanced chipsets to Chinese firms.  CXMT, China's top manufacturer of DRAM chips, has developed sample HBM chips in partnership with chip packaging and testing company Tongfu Microelectronics, according to three people briefed on the matter.

Google boss ‘cautiously optimistic’ about protecting elections from deepfakes,16/5/2024 1:03,"Martyn Landi, PA Technology Correspondent15 May 2024 at 6:03 pm·4-min read","Google boss Sundar Pichai has said he believes the tech giant, and wider industry, is well placed to combat AI-generated misinformation around elections. Concerns have been raised about the potential for AI-generated audio and visual content to be used by bad actors to interfere with elections around the world – in a year where billions of people in many of the world’s major democracies are due to go to the polls. Speaking during the technology giant’s annual developer conference, Google I/O, Mr Pichai said he was “cautiously optimistic” about the his own company’s ability to handle this threat, as well as the wider industry. He said Google had invested heavily in projects to monitor technological threats, including artificial intelligence, while also looked to develop its own AI tools in a safe and responsible fashion to reduce the potential for them to be used nefariously. “I think we all have come a long way as an industry over the past few years. I think as Google, we have invested in elections integrity as one of our highest priorities as a company, particularly in our products like search and YouTube and as we deploy AI, part of the reason we’re doing work like AI-assisted red teaming is to stay ahead of these problems,” Mr Pichai said. He added that the company had internal projects which identified threats to society and built technology to counter them, and also worked with governments on safety issues. He said: “We undertake a lot of research through projects like Jigsaw as well so we can understand patterns in the world and report on them.

Google is reinventing itself for the AI age,15/5/2024 17:54,Daniel Howley·Technology Editor15 May 2024 at 10:54 am·4-min read,"MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. — Google (GOOG, GOOGL) is in the midst of a full-blown AI evolution. On Tuesday, the company announced a flurry of AI products and services during its I/O developer conference with the aim of repositioning itself as the world’s AI software leader. “We are fully in our Gemini era,” CEO Sundar Pichai said during his keynote, referring to the company’s latest Gemini AI models, while noting that AI is still “in the very early days of the AI platform shift.” For years, Google was considered Silicon Valley’s AI powerhouse. But OpenAI and Microsoft (MSFT) threw the company off course, entering into a multibillion-dollar, multiyear partnership in 2023 that saw Microsoft integrate OpenAI’s most advanced models into its productivity, search, and cloud products. All this helped crown Microsoft as the world’s most valuable company earlier this year. Google’s climb back hasn’t been easy. It originally debuted a ChatGPT competitor called Bard that fell short of initial expectations. And more recently, it bungled the rollout of its generative AI-powered image generator, a tool that the company admitted was not “working the way we intended.” Stealing back the AI throne starts with Google reinventing its most important product: Search. Now — or soon, as it’s rolling out over time — at the top of the screen, you’ll find a generative AI-powered area called AI Overview that offers summarized responses to queries along with links to the sources. It’s a major departure for Google and could impact everything from the company’s advertisers, its main source of revenue, to websites that rely on the firm for search traffic, such as travel platforms and media organizations. While the Search changes are easily the biggest updates to Google’s public-facing products, they weren’t the only consequential announcements at the show. Google also showed off a new AI-powered prototype assistant called Project Astra. During a pre-recorded stage demo, the platform, which views content streamed through your smartphone camera, was able to identify objects, solve programming problems, and more. Unlike digital assistants Google Assistant and Apple’s (AAPL) Siri, Project Astra offers a more creative, conversational tone that sounds more human-like. It’s even able to understand when you interrupt it, stopping to listen without getting mad. Not human-like!",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/google-is-reinventing-itself-for-the-ai-age-175458095.html,GOOG
Bob Iger says Disney is 'dramatically' cutting investment in traditional TV,15/5/2024 17:17,Alexandra Canal·Senior Reporter15 May 2024 at 10:17 am·3-min read,"Disney (DIS) CEO Bob Iger said the media giant plans to ""pretty dramatically"" reduce its investments in linear television as the company works to make its streaming unit a consistently profitable division. Last summer, Iger said he would take an ""expansive"" look at the entertainment giant's traditional TV assets, signaling the potential for strategic options that could include a sale. That ultimately did not come to fruition, with Iger saying Wednesday that the company determined in its analysis that linear ""is not going to be a growth business but it could become an important component to our ability to engage with the consumer."" Iger said Dana Walden, who oversees Disney's television studios, and Jimmy Pitaro, who leads ESPN, have been tasked with reducing traditional network investments while also ""seamlessly"" managing the streaming businesses. ""You've got the same executives managing both, and their goal is to drive bottom-line growth,"" he said while speaking at a MoffettNathanson investor conference. One example of this duality includes placing episodes of ""Grey's Anatomy"" and ""Abbott Elementary,"" which air on ABC, onto the Hulu platform ""pretty quickly"" — or in some cases simultaneously. The audiences, Iger said, are different, with ABC's being ""older"" than Hulu's. ""We're basically aggregating greater audiences and we're amortizing costs,"" he added. Although the executive said he still expects erosion when it comes to linear TV subscribers, the segment will ""continue to drive profitability because we're managing our costs so effectively."" Overall, ""We feel comfortable with our hand right now because we're using those networks efficiently and effectively."" Linear networks have been a pain point for legacy media giants across the board as a dismal ad environment drags on revenue, coupled with the mass exodus of pay TV consumers.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/bob-iger-says-disney-is-dramatically-cutting-investment-in-traditional-tv-171707582.html,GOOG
Google tackles phone theft with new safety features coming to Android,15/5/2024 17:00,"Martyn Landi, PA Technology Correspondent15 May 2024 at 10:00 am·3-min read","Google has unveiled a range of new features for its Android operating system designed to combat mobile phone theft and fraud, including a new AI-powered tool that can detect when a phone has been snatched from the owner’s hand. As part of its updates to Android 15, the next version of the tech giant’s mobile operating system coming later this year, Theft Detection Lock will automatically lock a phone’s screen to prevent thieves from getting into the device. Google said its AI will be able to detect “common motion associated with theft” by reading signals from the device, such as the accelerometer reading the sudden jolt of someone on a bike snatching a phone from a user’s hand and then moving off at a high speed, to instantly lock the device. It will be joined by a range of tools to better secure and hide apps which may contain sensitive data that would be of interest to thieves, as well as features to simplify the ability to remote lock a phone after it has been stolen. Dave Burke, Android’s vice president of engineering, said the new theft detection tool had in part been inspired by feedback it had received from staff and users in Sao Paolo, Brazil, and London, where he said high levels of phone theft were being reported. “Some pretty scary statistics I learned fairly recently (were that) in Sao Paolo, a phone is stolen every five minutes, and in London a phone is stolen every six minutes,” he said. “That is a really serious issue, and we started thinking about it, what we can do, and we started studying (the issue).” He added that the company had studied videos of phone thefts carried out on bikes to develop the new feature. In October last year, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, and Mayor of London Sadiq Khan held a meeting with tech companies – including Google, about phone companies doing more to help combat phone theft after a rise in incidents in the capital over the previous 12 months. The new feature is being joined by other tools Google said “strengthen your device’s security against theft with new and improved protection features that will make thieves think twice about trying”.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/google-tackles-phone-theft-safety-170000578.html,GOOG
The Next AI Bull Run Just Started: 3 Top Ranked Stocks to Ride the Trend,15/5/2024 16:02,Ethan Feller15 May 2024 at 9:02 am·5-min read,"Yes, I know the last year has been all AI every day, but this theme is still early days. Exciting new products built from generative AI models are just beginning to come to market and will continue to change the way we interact with technology. Just this week there were two significant releases from both Microsoft’s MSFT OpenAI, and Alphabet GOOGL. Additionally, now that broad markets have traded sideways for the better part of two months, energy has been built for a major breakout in the leading names. These product releases should be a valuable catalyst for the next big rally. New AI Product Releases OpenAI introduced the newest iteration of their primary AI model, GPT-4o. The demonstrations of GPT-4o were extremely impressive, with one video showing the AI model interacting with and tutoring a young boy on his math homework. The GPT, young boy and father were all in conversation with each other, and the GPT helped him through the process in a supportive and logical way. It was really something, and I recommend those interested seek out some of the most recent demonstrations released online. Then, at Google I/O, Alphabet’s annual developer conference, the company introduced its newest AI enabled “Agents,” built throughout its platforms. This product is built on Gemini, Alphabet’s response to OpenAI’s GPT. In one demo, the presenter wanted to return a pair of shoes they bought online. They took a picture of them, and said to the agent, “I want to return these shoes, they don’t fit.” Gemini proceeded to find the order info in Gmail, fill out a return form, and scheduled a pickup from UPS. It really functioned like a personal assistant. The presentation also showed Gemini agents planning detailed trips catered to specific interests, summarizing long email chains, and working across multiple external websites to really simplify workflow. Again, I recommend those interested go watch the demo videos.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/next-ai-bull-run-just-160200870.html,GOOG
Google I/O shows why the search giant is sitting pretty against OpenAI,15/5/2024 15:26,Sharon Goldman15 May 2024 at 8:26 am·5-min read,"Google’s annual I/O developer conference kicked off yesterday, under the circus-like big top of the Shoreline Amphitheater, with improvisational musician and YouTuber Marc Rebillet climbing out of a giant Google coffee cup in a rainbow-colored robe. He stepped up to a DJ booth to show off Google’s new generative AI music tool, called MusicFX, with a demo filled with thumping beats meant to wake up, he shouted, the “silly little nerds.” It was a surprisingly silly moment after several days of serious buildup to this week of AI announcements, which turned out to include a preemptive product launch from OpenAI. Social media amped up sky-high expectations about how OpenAI might steal Google’s thunder: An announcement of its own ChatGPT search? A surprise roll-out of GPT-5? For a moment, it was easy to imagine Google getting, well, screwed by OpenAI's advance move. Or screwed once again, more accurately. After all, a year ago there were plenty of headlines like 'AI First' To Last: How Google Fell Behind In The AI Boom. After ChatGPT launched in November 2022, there were reports that Pichai had declared a ‘code red’ inside the company in response, so panicked was he about the threat OpenAI and its alliance with Microsoft posed to Google's business. From the outside, at least, it seemed like a humiliating takedown, considering that Google had been so far ahead in AI in 2019 that Microsoft decided to invest in OpenAI because it was “very worried” that Google was so far ahead in AI. And at 2023's Google I/O conference in 2023, the company seemed decidedly defensive, reminding the audience multiple times of how Google had been the first ""AI first"" company, and rolling out a slew of disjointed and not fully-thought-out product offerings and demos. The whole thing seemed rushed and designed to simply match Microsoft and OpenAI. This year was a whole different vibe. By yesterday afternoon, when both OpenAI's and Google's live-streamed announcements were finished—with nothing but memories left of OpenAI’s emotive-on-steroids voice assistant; Google’s rollout of AI Overviews in search; and several demos featuring dogs—it was clear why Pichai seemed so much more relaxed this year. It’s because far from screwing up on AI, Google actually is sitting pretty. Not only has it caught up to the point that its Gemini models are considered in the top-tier, but it has renewed confidence in the strength of a moat that OpenAI cannot easily cross: Google's vast consumer distribution across a deep and broad mix of products with billions of users. Many have accused Google of being bloated, bureaucratic and slow. But it has unparalleled scale. Jim Fan, a Nvidia senior research manager and lead of embodied AI, said it succinctly in an X post yesterday. “Google's strongest moat is distribution,” he wrote. “Gemini doesn't have to be the best model to be the most used one in the world.” OpenAI may have a technical lead—GPT-4 remains the state-of-the-art AI model to beat for certain reasoning tasks, for one thing—and as a startup with an $80 billion private market valuation, it may also be able to move faster than Google. But Google has Search, Gmail, Maps, Photos, Calendar, Drive, Docs, Sheets and Android. By integrating generative AI into all of those products and using AI to tie them all together (for example, an AI-powered workflow that scours your Google applications for data to bring into Sheets and also your Calendar) it can keep users coming back for more. Even the Google search box already ties in AI across products, offering options to search photos, translate text, solve homework with Google Lens, identify songs and shop for products in screenshots. Furthermore, if Google’s distribution is its strongest moat, its secret sauce is arguably the massive amounts of data that flows through its products every day—petabytes from web searches, YouTube videos, Map requests, customer reviews, and much more. In addition to training its models, users can ask Google's AI features to dig through data stored in Google apps to help with an ever-increasing array of personalized tasks–basically using Google to Google your own Google. Of course, none of this means Google’s future AI success is assured. It may be able to rack up user numbers with its deep product bench and broad reach, but when it comes to revenue, the company’s business model is wrapped around Search. And it remains to be seen whether the rollout of AI Overviews in Search will cannibalize its referrals and ads business. It also remains uncertain how badly generative AI -created content will pollute the entire information ecosystem, resulting in worse search results—whether AI-generated or ranked links—and driving users away. In addition, while it can’t be as nimble and quick as OpenAI, Google needs to avoid tying itself in knots over being ""responsible,"" as it did during the “woke” image controversy around Gemini back in February. But, it increasingly looks as though OpenAI will have to wage an uphill battle. If it wants to beat Google on consumer-facing AI products, it will have to show that it roll-out AI models that are better than Google's by a wide margin, and it will have to keep rolling those out to stay ahead. A rumored partnership with Apple to add ChatGPT to iPhones could help—Apple has the distribution OpenAI lacks, even with its Microsoft partnership. But short of announcing that the company has somehow reached AGI (whatever it deems that to be), Google has shown it will be very difficult to dislodge it from being the AI most consumers are likely to use.

4 Top Stocks to Tap Nasdaq's New All-Time High,15/5/2024 12:50,Ritujay Ghosh15 May 2024 at 5:50 am·4-min read,"The Nasdaq Composite witnessed a robust 2023 and first quarter of 2024. The bull run has also continued into the second quarter despite growing concerns over inflation. On May 14, the tech-heavy Nasdaq ended 0.8% higher to close at a new record high of 16,511.18 points. The index has rallied 10% year to date after jumping 43.4% in 2023 to record its best year since 2020. This year, so far, has been great for Wall Street, with the Dow and the S&P 500 also notching record highs in February. The Nasdaq was a shade slow in catching up but finally hit an all-time high in February. The index has since had a solid run and May particularly has been great. The rally comes despite growing concerns over inflation and rising uncertainty over rate cuts. This year, the Nasdaq’s dream run has primarily been driven by the enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI. While the opinions of experts on the prospects of generative AI vary, significant enthusiasm surrounding the field has been noticed over the past year. Many believe that AI is still at a nascent stage and its full potential is yet to be realized. Once this potential is unlocked, AI is expected to create significant business opportunities for technology companies to produce premium products and, in turn, boost their stocks. Besides, the development of smart devices is contributing to the growth of the AI space, as they require computing and learning capabilities for tasks like face detection, image recognition, and video analytics. These functions require high processing power, speed, memory, low power consumption, and improved graphic processors and solutions, all of which create favorable conditions for the semiconductor industry’s growth. Moreover, while uncertainty over rate cuts raised concerns, the Federal Reserve said earlier this month that any further interest rate hike is unlikely. High-interest rates have a negative impact on growth assets such as technology stocks, and the Federal Reserve’s comments were cheered by investors.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/4-top-stocks-tap-nasdaqs-125000338.html,GOOG

"News publishers sound alarm on Google’s new AI-infused search, warn of ‘catastrophic’ impacts",15/5/2024 11:04,"Oliver Darcy, CNN15 May 2024 at 4:04 am·4-min read","Editor’s Note: A version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here. The A.I. doomsday clock appears ready to strike midnight for publishers. Google on Tuesday announced that it will infuse its ubiquitous search engine with its powerful artificial intelligence model, Gemini, drawing on the rapidly advancing technology to directly answer user queries at the top of results pages. “Google will do the Googling for you,” the company explained. In other words, users will soon no longer have to click on the links displayed in search results to find the information they are seeking. On its surface that might sound convenient, but for news publishers — many of whom are already struggling with steep traffic declines — the revamped search experience will likely cause an even further decrease in audience, potentially starving them of readers and revenue. Why spend time clicking on a link when Google has already scoured the internet and harvested the relevant information with its A.I.? “Google will take care of the legwork,” executives said. But a lot of that legwork, of course, comes in the form of human-written articles and expertise published across the internet on blogs and media outlets, all built on a foundation of advertising support. Google’s message was heard loud and clear. Within hours of the Mountain View announcement, the news industry began sounding the alarm. “This will be catastrophic to our traffic, as marketed by Google to further satisfy user queries, leaving even less incentive to click through so that we can monetize our content,” Danielle Coffey, the chief executive of the News/Media Alliance, bluntly told CNN. Coffey, whose organization represents more than 2,000 news publishers and has taken an aggressive posture toward A.I. developers’ use of journalism, added: “The little traffic we get today will be further diminished, and with a dominant search engine that’s cementing its market power, we once again have to adhere to their terms. This time with a product that directly competes with our content, using our content to fuel it. This is a perverse twist on ‘innovation.’” The announcement from Google, which newsrooms had expected and expressed worry over in both public and private forums in recent months, is poised to further batter an industry that has been dealt a series of brutal blows — much of it at the hands of Big Tech — over the last several years. It also comes as OpenAI reportedly readies to launch its own A.I.-powered search engine. Since ChatGPT crashed onto the scene more than a year ago, showcasing the potential power of A.I. for the public and setting off an arms race with Google, Meta and others, publishers have worried greatly about the impact the technology will ultimately have on their businesses. But they have had little time to plan their responses to the transformative technology, given the breakneck pace in which it has developed.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/news-publishers-sound-alarm-google-110423634.html,GOOG

YouTube to block Hong Kong protest anthem videos after court order,15/5/2024 4:42,Jeffrey Dastin and James PomfretUpdated 14 May 2024 at 9:42 pm·3-min read,"By Jeffrey Dastin and James Pomfret MOUNTAIN VIEW/HONG KONG (Reuters) -Alphabet's YouTube on Tuesday said it would comply with a court decision and block access inside Hong Kong to 32 video links deemed prohibited content, in what critics say is a blow to freedoms in the financial hub amid a security clampdown. The action follows a government application granted by Hong Kong's Court of Appeal requesting the ban of a protest anthem called ""Glory to Hong Kong."" The judges warned that dissidents seeking to incite secession could weaponize the song for use against the state. In comments criticizing the court order, YouTube said the ruling would raise skepticism around the Hong Kong government's work to foster the digital economy and reclaim its reputation as a predictable place for doing business. ""We are disappointed by the Court's decision but are complying with its removal order,"" YouTube said in a statement, saying it shared human rights groups' concerns that the content ban could chill free expression online. ""We'll continue to consider our options for an appeal, to promote access to information."" Some observers, including the U.S. government, say the ban will further undermine Hong Kong's international reputation as a financial hub, and raise concerns about the erosion of freedoms and its commitment to the free flow of information. ""It is not a desirable situation from the perspective of free internet and free speech,"" said George Chen, co-chair of digital practice at the Asia Group, a Washington DC-based business policy consultancy. He is also former head of public policy for Greater China at Meta. ""Now the question is how far and how aggressive the government wants to go,"" Chen added. ""If you start to send platforms 100 or 1,000 links for takedown every day, this will drive platforms crazy and also make global investors more worried about Hong Kong’s free market environment.

During a two-hour keynote event to open its annual I/O developer conference – and where the phrase “AI” was mentioned more than 120 times – the firm laid out how it would be further integrating generative AI into its most well-known products. Here is a look at the key announcements from the event. – Rebuilding search for generative AI Google Search, the most well-known part of the company’s business, is being revamped for the generative AI, Google confirmed. In the coming weeks, it will begin rolling out AI Overviews, a new type of search result powered by AI. Powered by Google’s Gemini AI model, AI Overviews is able to understand longer and more complex queries and provide a range of suggestions in response, breaking queries into key parts and offering multiple perspectives from the web. Google says the aim is to “take the legwork” out of searching by providing a wider range of content in one place as new look search results. It will begin rolling out in the US this week, with support for more countries set to follow shortly. – Project Astra",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/key-announcements-google-o-conference-204028462.html,GOOG
"Google shows off astonishing vision for how AI will work with Gmail, Photos and more",14/5/2024 19:44,"Samantha Murphy Kelly, CNN14 May 2024 at 12:44 pm·5-min read","A day after OpenAI impressed with a startlingly improved ChatGPT AI model, Google showed off an equally stunning vision for how AI will improve the products that billions of people use every day. The updates, announced at its annual Google I/O developer conference, come as the company is trying to push beyond its core advertising business with new devices and AI-powered tools. Artificial intelligence was so top of mind during the event, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said at the end of the presentation the term “AI” was said 120 times – as counted by none other than its AI platform Gemini. During the keynote, Google showed how it wants its AI products to become a bigger part of users’ lives, such as by sharing information, interacting with others, finding objects around the house, making schedules, shopping and using an Android device. Google essentially wants its AI to be part of everything you do. Pichai kicked off the event by highlighting various new features powered by its latest AI model Gemini 1.5 Pro. One new feature, called Ask Photos, allows users to search photos for deeper insights, such as asking when your daughter learned to swim or recall what your license plate number is, by looking through saved pictures. He also showed how users can ask Gemini 1.5 Pro to summarize all recent emails from your child’s school by analyzing attachments, and summarizing key points and spitting out action items. Meanwhile, Google executives took turns demonstrating other capabilities, such as how the latest model could “read” a textbook and turn it into a kind of AI lecture featuring natural-sounding teachers that answer questions. Just one day before, OpenAI — one of the tech industry’s leaders in artificial intelligence — unveiled a new AI model that it says will make chatbot ChatGPT smarter and easier to use. GPT-4o aims to turn ChatGPT into a digital personal assistant that can engage in real-time, spoken conversations and interact using text and “vision.” It can view screenshots, photos, documents or charts uploaded by users and have a conversation about them. Google also showed off Gemini’s latest abilities to take different kinds of input — “multimodal” capabilities to take in text, voice or images — as a direct response to ChatGPT’s efforts. A Google executive also demoed a virtual “teammate” that can help stay on top of to-do lists, organize data and manage workflow. The company also highlighted search improvements by allowing users to ask more natural or more focused questions, and providing various versions of the responses, such as in-depth or summarized results. It can also make targeted suggestions, such as recommending kid friendly restaurants in certain locations, or note what might be wrong with a gadget, such as a camera, by taking a video of the issue via Google Lens. The goal is to take the legwork out of searching on Google, the company said. The company also briefly teased Project Astra, developed by Google’s DeepMind AI lab, which will allow AI assistants to help users’ everyday lives by using phone cameras to interpret information about the real world, such as identifying objects and even finding misplaced items. It also hinted at how it would work on augmented reality glasses.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/google-shows-off-astonishing-vision-194436133.html,GOOG
Waymo and Zoox are under federal investigation as self-driving cars allegedly behave erratically,14/5/2024 19:35,"Peter Valdes-Dapena, CNN14 May 2024 at 12:35 pm·2-min read","The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating two autonomous driving companies following incidents in which the vehicles behaved erratically and sometimes disobeyed traffic safety rules or were involved in crashes. The investigations involve Waymo, the self-driving technology subsidiary of Google’s parent company Alphabet, as well as Zoox, the autonomous vehicle subsidiary of Amazon. The companies are required by regulators to report any crashes or other incidents that occur as their vehicles drive on public roads. NHTSA has learned of 22 incidents in which self-driving Waymo cars “exhibited driving behavior that potentially violated traffic safety laws,” according to a document posted online by NHTSA, including situations in which the vehicles “appeared to disobey traffic safety control devices.” In some cases, the vehicles collided with stationary objects such as gates and chains. This sometimes happened after the vehicles “exhibited unexpected behaviors.’ In some cases, the Waymo vehicle was driving entirely on its own, but in other cases the vehicle had a human in the driver’s seat supervising its operation. In cases where the human driver was present, the Waymo vehicle’s autonomous driving system was shut off moments before a collision. Information about the accidents was either reported to the NHTSA as required under federal regulations or was drawn from publicly available reports, according to NHTSA. “At Waymo we currently serve over 50 thousand weekly trips for our riders in some of the most challenging and complex environments,” the company said in a statement emailed to CNN. “We are proud of our performance and safety record over tens of millions of autonomous miles driven, as well as our demonstrated commitment to safety transparency.” Waymo is cooperating with NHTSA in the investigation, the company indicated in its statement. NHTSA is also investigating self-driving vehicles operated by Zoox, the autonomous technology subsidiary of Amazon. In two separate incidents, self-driving Toyota Highlanders operated by Zoox braked suddenly and unexpectedly, and then were rear-ended by motorcyclists. In one case, a motorcyclist was slightly injured in the crashes, in the other a Zoox safety driver was hurt. The NHTSA investigation will look into the Zoox self-driving system’s “behavior in crosswalks around vulnerable road users, and in other similar rear-end collision scenarios.” “Transparency and collaboration with regulators is of the utmost importance, and we remain committed to working closely with NHTSA to answer their questions,” a Zoox spokesperson said in an email. Cruise, GM’s autonomous driving technology subsidiary, announced Monday that it plans to return to testing its vehicles on public roads this week. This follows a months-long pause after an October incident in which a pedestrian was badly injured.

The tech giant has announced a wide range of new tools powered by its Gemini AI model, including abilities to use text, image and video to interact with its AI assistant across different Google apps. The updates came a day after ChatGPT maker OpenAI showed off developments to the popular chatbot which enable it to have more human-like conversations and respond more easily to voice prompts, as well as text, audio and visual prompts – a process known as being multimodal. Industry expert and Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said: “Coming on the heels of OpenAI’s GPT-4o announcement, it’s no surprise that AI is a major theme at Google’s I/O, including a demo of Gemini’s latest multimodal capabilities as a direct response to ChatGPT’s voice mode. “By showcasing its latest models and how they’ll power existing products with strong consumer reach, Google is demonstrating how it can effectively differentiate itself from rivals.” Leo Gebbie from CCS Insight said this area of the technology will become a key battleground between the biggest AI firms. “A major push from Google – and from competitors like OpenAI – is in multimodal AI, which is intended to make it easier to engage with the technology across a range of input and outputs,” he said. “This promises to make AI more contextually aware and allow more natural interactions through voice commands or by sharing images and video. “Multimodal AI holds huge promise in building assistants which are more useful in more places than ever before. “Plenty of us have experienced the limitations of using voice assistants like Alexa, Siri and Google’s own Assistant, where conversations are currently limited and stilted. However, more intelligent multimodal AI should unlock a far more conversational and natural user experience.”",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/google-ai-updates-direct-response-191357643.html,GOOG

TikTok creators file suit to block US divestment or ban law,14/5/2024 19:00,Reuters14 May 2024 at 12:00 pm·1-min read,"WASHINGTON, May 14 (Reuters) - A group of TikTok creators said Tuesday they filed suit in U.S. federal court seeking to block a law signed by President Joe Biden that would force the divestiture of the short video app used by 170 million Americans or ban it. ""Although they come from different places, professions, walks of life, and political persuasions, they are united in their view that TikTok provides them a unique and irreplaceable means to express themselves and form community,"" said the lawsuit. Davis Wright Tremaine LLP, a law firm representing the creators, provided a copy of the lawsuit to Reuters it said had been filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The suit, which seeks injunctive relief, says the law threatens free speech and ""promises to shutter a discrete medium of communication that has become part of American life."" Last week, TikTok and its Chinese parent company ByteDance filed a similar lawsuit, arguing that the law violates the U.S. Constitution on a number of grounds including running afoul of First Amendment free speech protections. TikTok creators filed a similar suit in 2020 to block a prior attempt to block the app, and also sued last year in Montana asking a court to block a state ban. The law, signed by Biden on April 24, gives ByteDance until Jan. 19 to sell TikTok or face a ban. The White House has said it wants to see Chinese-based ownership ended on national security grounds but not a ban on TikTok. The law prohibits app stores like Apple, and Alphabet's Google, from offering TikTok and bars internet hosting services from supporting TikTok unless ByteDance divests TikTok by Jan. 19.

Gaza protesters block entrance to Google conference over Israel contracts,14/5/2024 18:52,Kari Paul14 May 2024 at 11:52 am·2-min read,"Hundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters chained themselves together in front of the entrance to Google’s annual developer conference on Tuesday in protest of the tech company’s ties to Israeli military projects. Thousands of attendees waiting to enter Google I/O were redirected to another entrance, and the event started on time. Groups including the No Tech for Genocide coalition and other groups from across the Bay Area held a sign reading “Google stop fueling genocide”. They chanted “we won’t stop til Nimbus gets dropped,” referencing a $1.2bn project supported by Amazon and Google that provides provides artificial intelligence and cloud computing services to the Israeli government. Speaking before the crowd, a protester said people have gathered in Mountain View to attend Google’s highly anticipated annual conference, but that protesters were there to share “the real story”.

Related: Google restricts AI chatbot Gemini from answering questions on 2024 elections The featured has also been tested in the UK but will be rolled out across the US beginning on Tuesday, Google announced at its annual I/O developer conference Tuesday in California. Google Search head Liz Reid said AI Overviews would become available to “more than a billion people” by the end of the year. Google also announced a text-to-video artificial intelligence model called Veo, allowing for the creation of computer-generated footage based only on written prompts. The model is a clear rival to OpenAI’s Sora, which performs similar functions and is planned to be released to the public later this year. Google additionally revealed a new AI assistant in progress under the working name Project Astra, previewing an early version of the voice tool that can use a smartphone’s camera to verbally identify locations, read and explain computer code and create alliterative sentences. The assistant was previewed to journalists in a video demo and showed the tool interacting by voice with a Google employee, using the camera lens to identify the view from a window – the London area of King’s Cross, where Google’s AI unit is based – and comprehend computer code. Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google, said the tool was “pretty magical”, with Google aiming for its debut in the second half of this year. The company said its overviews feature would be able to handle complex questions such as finding Pilates studios in the US city of Boston, showing their best prices and their walking times from a specific location – all asked in one query. Using Gemini’s technology, Google will start the response with an AI-generated summary, which then links out to other content including web links. The Veo demonstration showed filmmaker and actor Donald Glover praising the model as AI generations like a sailboat gliding across the sea played onscreen. “Everybody is gonna be a director,” Glover said. “And everybody should be.” Concerns over AI-generated footage replacing the work of filmmakers and entertainment industry workers has been a major labor rights issue in recent years. Some of the country’s most prominent entertainment unions, such as Sag-Aftra, have gone on strike over issues that include how studios are allowed to use AI.

OpenAI’s new GPT-4o model offers promise of improved smartphone assistants,14/5/2024 18:00,Alex Hern UK technology editor14 May 2024 at 11:00 am·3-min read,"In the year and a half since the launch of ChatGPT, one nagging question has only got more pressing: if AI can do this, why is my phone’s assistant still so bad? On Monday, the gulf grew larger still, as OpenAI announced a new model called GPT-4o – the ‘o’ stands for Omni – which gives the chatbot new abilities to understand and create audio, video, and still images. The system is uncanny to behold. It can engage in prolonged conversations about the world seen through a camera lens, carry out live translation between two different languages, and even laugh at appropriate points. The shine will inevitably wear off after users find the shortcomings in the system, but its creators are more confident than ever. When GPT-4 was launched in 2023, the OpenAI founder, Sam Altman, tweeted that the AI “is still flawed, still limited, and it still seems more impressive on first use than it does after you spend more time with it”. A year on, there was no such doubt with the launch of its successor: as well as a longer statement about an “an exciting future where we are able to use computers to do much more than ever before”, Altman tweeted a single word: “her”, the name of the 2013 Spike Jonze film depicting a man slowly falling in love with his AI assistant. GPT-4o is closer than ever to that science fiction scenario. Previous versions of the AI have been able to talk to the user, but only through a laborious process of transcribing speech to text, running it through the normal ChatGPT system, then generating human-sounding speech in reply. By contrast, the new system can operate directly in speech without needing to lean on other models to prop it up, speeding up responses and allowing it to acknowledge quirks such as tone of voice. But it still isn’t quite an AI assistant. It can answer questions and perform knowledge work, but not – yet – act on requests. The GPT Store, a repository of third-party integrations collated by OpenAI, could help, but to really embed itself in normal people’s lives, GPT needs the power of Siri. And it seems Apple agrees. The iPhone maker has reportedly been in talks since March with AI developers, including Google and OpenAI, over licensing their technology to improve its own AI assistant. Over the weekend it reportedly “neared” a deal with the latter. According to Bloomberg, which broke the news, the deal would allow Apple to offer ChatGPT alongside the other AI features it will announce at its annual Worldwide Developers conference in June. The link-up would probably fall short of fully replacing Siri with ChatGPT. That is partly because Apple is wary of embedding another company’s technology too deeply in its own devices – the scars from the painful replacement of Google Maps with Apple Maps over a decade ago still smart – but also because even the best AI systems aren’t quite ready for the sort of demands an assistant requires.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/openai-gpt-4o-model-offers-180000533.html,GOOG

The announcements are part of Google’s broader effort to reestablish itself as Silicon Valley’s AI leader after it was caught off guard by Microsoft’s (MSFT) partnership with OpenAI in 2022. The new products also come a day after OpenAI unveiled its GPT-4o AI model and days before rivals Microsoft and Apple (AAPL) debut their own major generative AI updates. The biggest announcement is that Google is updating its Search platform to include generative AI results at the top of the screen. The feature, which was originally available as part of a preview in the company's Search Labs, is now coming to all US users and rolling out globally in the coming future. Another one of the biggest announcements was a new, personalized AI assistant called Gemini Live. The feature, powered by the company’s Gemini 1.5 Pro model, will allow you to speak directly to the assistant on your mobile device, providing you with responses in a number of natural-sounding voices. On the Android front, Google says it's expanding the assistant to interact with apps like Google Messages and Gmail, allowing users, for example, to drag and drop generated images from Gemini into texts and emails. Users can also use the app to ask specific questions about YouTube videos, and it will scour the video's captions to find an answer. Google is also updating its on-device version of Gemini, called Gemini Nano, with new multimodal features. Multimodal means that a generative AI model can work across mediums including text, images, and video. Google’s vice president of engineering for Gemini experiences, Amar Subramanya, told Yahoo Finance he’s been using Gemini Live for brainstorming, bouncing ideas off of the assistant. Subramanya said early testers have also been using Gemini Live for scenarios including translation. In the coming months, Google says Gemini Live will be able to access a user's cameras, allowing the assistant to interact with the real world and things it sees. OpenAI has also shown off these capabilities in demos of its GPT-4o. In one example, Subramanya said he asked the assistant to find a recipe for a pineapple upside-down cake for 15 people and add the ingredients to his Keep shopping list.

"Google unleashes AI in search, raising hopes for better results and fears about less web traffic",14/5/2024 20:03,MICHAEL LIEDTKEUpdated 14 May 2024 at 1:03 pm·6-min read,"MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (AP) — Google on Tuesday rolled out a retooled search engine that will frequently favor responses crafted by artificial intelligence over website links, a shift promising to quicken the quest for information while also potentially disrupting the flow of money-making internet traffic. The makeover announced at Google's annual developers conference will begin this week in the U.S. when hundreds of millions of people will start to periodically see conversational summaries generated by the company's AI technology at the top of the search engine's results page. The AI overviews are supposed to only crop up when Google's technology determines they will be the quickest and most effective way to satisfy a user's curiosity — a solution mostly likely to happen with complex subjects or when people are brainstorming, or planning. People will likely still see Google's traditional website links and ads for simple searches for things like a store recommendation or weather forecasts. Google began testing AI overviews with a small subset of selected users a year ago, but the company is now making it one of the staples in its search results in the U.S. before introducing the feature in other parts of the world. By the end of the year, Google expects the recurring AI overviews to be part of its search results for about 1 billion people. Besides infusing more AI into its dominant search engine, Google also used the packed conference held at a Mountain View, California, amphitheater near its headquarters to showcase advances in a technology that is reshaping business and society. The next AI steps included more sophisticated analysis powered by Gemini — a technology unveiled five months ago — and smarter assistants, or “agents,"" including a still-nascent version dubbed “Astra"" that will be able to understand, explain and remember things it is shown through a smartphone's camera lens. Google underscored its commitment to AI by bringing in Demis Hassabis, the executive who oversees the technology, to appear on stage at its marquee conference for the first time. The injection of more AI into Google's search engine marks one of the most dramatic changes that the company has made in its foundation since its inception in the late 1990s. It's a move that opens the door for more growth and innovation but also threatens to trigger a sea change in web surfing habits. “This bold and responsible approach is fundamental to delivering on our mission and making AI more helpful for everyone,” Google CEO Sundar Pichai told a group of reporters. Well aware of how much attention is centered on the technology, Pichai ended a nearly two-hour succession of presentations by asking Google's Gemini model how many times AI had been mentioned. The count: 120, and then the tally edged up by one more when Pichai said, “AI,” yet again. The increased AI emphasis will bring new risks to an internet ecosystem that depends heavily on digital advertising as its financial lifeblood.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/googles-unleashes-ai-search-raising-175515865.html,GOOG
OpenAI and Google lean in to AI personal assistants. Is this AI’s killer app?,14/5/2024 17:46,Jeremy Kahn14 May 2024 at 10:46 am·9-min read,"Hello and welcome to Eye on AI. The big news in AI this week are the dueling product announcements from OpenAI and Google. OpenAI has consistently tried to steal the news cycle from rivals by jumping out in front of their big product reveals with its own product releases, and this week was no different. The AI startup had built expectations around yesterday’s announcement so high—with rampant speculation that OpenAI would debut GPT-5 or a generative AI search engine—that CEO Sam Altman took to social media platform X on Friday to disabuse people of those ideas, while still trying to build excitement for Monday’s product reveal. What the company did announce was a souped-up version of GPT-4 called GPT-4o—the “o” stands for omni—that is designed to act as a personal assistant on a phone or tablet, with improved voice interaction, the ability to interpret and reason about pictures from a device’s camera, more capable language translation, and much faster response times. The assistant, with a default female voice, is apparently explicitly modeled on the digital assistant in the 2013 Spike Jonze movie Her. OpenAI may have misplayed the expectations game a bit since compared to the hype it drummed up, many viewers of its livestream event seemed underwhelmed by the announcement. (To combat this, Altman and OpenAI also published blog posts as well as short videos showcasing a variety of use cases for the new model.) The technological innovations behind GPT-4o are impressive. The model is natively multimodal—trained to take in voice and then produce voice, for example—as opposed to taking in the user’s voice, turning it into text that is fed to GPT-4 to create a prompt, and then feeding the resulting output to a text-to-speech model to produce a voice response. This speeds up the entire cycle. OpenAI has also impressively shrunk the number of tokens—segments of data that the model processes (in the case of English text, a token is usually equal to a word and a half)—the model requires to perform a task. This also makes the model considerably faster and cheaper to run than GPT-4 Turbo, OpenAI's previous best model. This, in turn, has enabled OpenAI to make GPT-4o available for free to all ChatGPT users, as well as to offer enterprise customers and developers use of the model through OpenAI’s API for half the cost of GPT-4 Turbo. Then today, at Google’s I/O developer conference, the search giant announced a raft of new AI features and upcoming product releases, from the integration of generative AI capsule answers into its main search engine, a way to query the photos saved on Google Photos, and improvements to its Gemini chatbot. As my colleague Sharon Goldman, who is at I/O, relays, Google’s version of the AI personal assistant is being developed through what it’s calling “Project Astra,” with capabilities the company said will come to Google products, like the Gemini app, later this year. Demo videos that the company emphasized were done live in one take showed someone using a smartphone camera to show the AI what was around them. While right now OpenAI's GPT-4o can only process still images, Astra can handle video. In addition, Google also unveiled improvements to its already very capable Gemini 1.5 Pro model so that it can have more natural-sounding, longer dialogues, better understanding of audio and images, more logical reasoning and planning capabilities, and better computer code generation. This is the sort of AI software that Google teased in December with a canned demonstration that was panned by reporters for being misleading about AI model Gemini’s video processing capabilities. Well, now Google is saying it has these capabilities for real. The company has also announced a doubling of the context window—how much data its models can process—for Gemini 1.5 Pro to 2 million tokens. That means the model can take in many books’ worth of text or the video equivalent of a feature film. Larger context windows don’t just allow the models to process more information, they also tend to reduce the model’s tendency to hallucinate (i.e. provide plausible but inaccurate outputs). Google also teased a future AI “agent” model that will be able to perform actions for users—such as booking movie tickets and flights—not simply generate text. There are a few things to say about these announcements from OpenAI and Google. One is that they clearly put Apple and Amazon on the back foot. They need to upgrade Siri and Alexa to match these new rival capabilities or those products will be in trouble. We know both companies are working on it, and Amazon has Anthropic’s powerful Claude AI models to use. Apple is by all accounts much further behind on its generative AI efforts—which is why there are reports it was negotiating with OpenAI to license its technology in the near term. My colleague David Meyer has more on this in today’s Data Sheet newsletter. More broadly, are these new personal assistants AI’s killer app? I think the verdict is very much still out—and depends entirely on what comes next. Most of the use cases OpenAI showcased so far seem fun and somewhat helpful, especially to parents, such as tutoring your kids or telling bedtime stories. But it’s unclear whether they are the sort of thing that will make such assistants ubiquitous, must-have products. The one exception might be translation—the ability to have a universal interpreter in your pocket wherever in the world you go could be transformative. But almost none of the use cases OpenAI or Google highlighted for the new assistants were around helping people in their jobs. That may change when these assistants have more “agentic” properties—and also when they can actually learn more about our personal preferences—and then complete tasks to our liking. We could all use a personal assistant that can actually do things for us in our daily lives—do our online grocery shopping for us, fill out insurance forms, book our vacations, etc. That really is likely to be a killer app.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/openai-google-lean-ai-personal-174640861.html,GOOG

""Industry demand for (machine learning) computer has grown by a factor of 1 million in the last six years, roughly increasing 10-fold every year,"" Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said in a briefing call with reporters. ""I think Google was built for this moment, we've been pioneering (AI chips) for more than a decade."" Alphabet's effort to build custom chips for AI data centers represents one of the few viable alternatives to Nvidia's top-of-the-line processors that dominate the market. Together with the software that is closely tied to Google's tensor processing units (TPUs), the chips have allowed the company to take a significant share of the market. Nvidia commands roughly 80% of the AI data center chip market, and the vast majority of the remaining 20% is various versions of Google's TPUs. The company doesn't sell the chip itself, but rents access through its cloud computing platform. The sixth-generation Trillium chip will achieve 4.7 times better computing performance compared with the TPU v5e, according to Google, a chip designed to power the tech that generates text and other media from large models. The Trillium processor is 67% more energy efficient than the v5e. The new chip will be available to its cloud customers in ""late 2024,"" the company said. Google's engineers achieved additional performance gains by increasing the amount of high-bandwidth memory capacity and overall bandwidth. AI models require enormous amounts of advanced memory, which has been a bottleneck to further boosting performance.

""Those three products will come at a vastly reduced price to anything in the market today and be available to all our customers,"" Roberts said. Exact pricing details will be announced at a later date. ""We've been bundling video successfully and creatively for 60 years,"" he added. ""This is the latest iteration of that, and I think this will be a pretty compelling package."" The developments come as media companies face pressure from investors to scale their streaming services and achieve profitability. At the same time, the companies are dealing with more competition from tech giants like Amazon (AMZN) and YouTube (GOOGL, GOOG), which are gobbling up streaming deals. On average, US consumers subscribe to four streaming services and spend about $61 per month on them, according to the latest Digital Media Trends report from Deloitte. That means fewer opportunities for streamers to retain loyal subscribers over time. The concept of bundling isn't new. Companies in the space have been doing it with their own services for years. Apple, for instance, offers Apple One, which combines Apple TV+ with other services like Apple Music and Apple Arcade. The bundle launched globally in late 2020. Disney, which has also been offering a bundle with Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+, officially began its domestic rollout of a one-app experience late last year that incorporates Hulu content via Disney+ — a similar play to Paramount's Showtime combination as well as the integration of HBO Max and Discovery+, which both merged their respective services last year.

Hundreds of self-driving cars investigated over disregarding traffic rules,14/5/2024 13:51,Matt Oliver14 May 2024 at 6:51 am·2-min read,"Google’s robot taxis are to be investigated by American regulators amid claims the self-driving cars flouted traffic laws. The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) on Tuesday said its investigation would look at 444 vehicles owned by Waymo, a subsidiary of Google’s parent Alphabet. It follows reports of 22 incidents, including 17 collisions, which included behaviour that potentially broke traffic laws, the regulator said. In some of those cases, Waymo’s cars appeared to disobey “traffic safety control devices” – which can include street signs, traffic signals and road markings – and crashes happened after the vehicles “exhibited unexpected behaviour”, the NHTSA added. Other reports included collisions with objects such as gates and chains, or crashes involving parked vehicles, while there were examples of vehicles “driving in opposing lanes with nearby oncoming traffic or entering construction zones”. The move is the latest step taken by the regulator amid safety fears about driverless cars. It has also launched similar investigations into rival driverless car firms Cruise and Zoox, which are owned by General Motors and Amazon respectively. In February, Waymo recalled 444 self-driving vehicles following two collisions in quick succession in Arizona.

Waymo is latest company under investigation for autonomous or partially automated technology,14/5/2024 14:21,TOM KRISHERUpdated 14 May 2024 at 7:21 am·4-min read,"DETROIT (AP) — The U.S. government's highway safety agency has opened another investigation of automated driving systems, this time into crashes involving Waymo's self-driving vehicles. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration posted documents detailing the probe on its website early Tuesday after getting 22 reports of Waymo vehicles either crashing or doing something that may have violated traffic laws. In the past month, the agency has opened at least four investigations of vehicles that can either drive themselves or take on at least some driving functions as it appears to be getting more aggressive in regulating the devices. In the probe of Waymo, which was once Google's self-driving vehicle unit, the agency said it has reports of 17 crashes and five other reports of possible traffic law violations. No injuries were reported. In the crashes, the Waymo vehicles hit stationary objects such as gates, chains or parked vehicles. Some of the incidents happened shortly after the Waymo driving system behaved unexpectedly near traffic control devices, according to the documents. Waymo said NHTSA plays an important role in road safety, and it will continue working with the agency “as part of our mission to become the world’s most trusted driver.” The company said it makes over 50,000 weekly trips with riders in challenging environments. “We are proud of our performance and safety record over tens of millions of autonomous miles driven, as well as our demonstrated commitment to safety transparency,” the statement said. Waymo, based in Mountain View, California, has been operating robotaxis without human safety drivers in Arizona and California. Michael Brooks, executive director of the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety, said NHTSA's more aggressive actions show that autonomous vehicles may not be ready yet for public roads. The agency's only enforcement power on autonomous vehicles, at present, is to open investigations and seek recalls, which it is doing, Brooks said. NHTSA has been criticized in the past for being slow to regulate Tesla and other companies that offer automated driving systems, but Brooks said things appear to have changed.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/us-investigating-waymo-autonomous-vehicles-100145190.html,GOOG

Google I/O: Tech conference expected to be dominated by AI,14/5/2024 1:45,"Martyn Landi, PA Technology Correspondent13 May 2024 at 6:45 pm·2-min read","Google is expected to unveil a string of new artificial intelligence-powered features when it opens its annual developer conference later on Tuesday. Google I/O is the traditional launch point for major updates to the technology giant’s key products and services – including Search, Maps, YouTube and the Android software that powers many smartphones and tablets. This year’s event in California is widely expected to see the company talk at length about how it is integrating generative AI into its products, having launched its revamped AI chatbot, Gemini, earlier this year. In April, Google announced it had launched an experiment in the UK to test using generative AI to respond to some search queries, with the responses from Google’s chatbot showing up alongside the traditional search results and web links. This is one of a number of AI-powered features the tech giant has been testing and could be given a wider rollout during I/O. There have also been reports that Google could be planning to introduce a new digital assistant at the heart of its Pixel smartphones. It has been suggested that any new assistant would have multimodal capabilities, meaning it is able to process, understand and respond to text, images and audio around one subject as they are fed to it. Elsewhere, Google could use the event to preview its next flagship Pixel smartphone, which is due in the autumn, as well as other parts of its hardware line-up, including tablets and smart home hubs. The announcements come as a new wave of innovation is expected around generative AI, particularly from the world’s biggest tech firms. Microsoft has its own developer conference next week and Apple’s follows in early June, with both also expected to heavily focus on their development and integration of generative AI tools.

PayPal Is Holding Its Ground Amid Clash Of Digital Payment Titans,13/5/2024 21:40,Upwallstreet13 May 2024 at 2:40 pm·3-min read,"In recent years, PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: PYPL) has been struggling as Big Tech titans, Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) expanded its footprint in digital payments. Even Robinhood (NASDAQ: HOOD) is entering the credit card arena. The Robinhood Gold Card pitch is impressive, to say the least, and promises to give both Apple and PayPal a headache. But at the end of April, PayPal showed it is determined to reignite the growth story of its brand offferings while its unbranded businesses continue to grow, as it confidently lifted its full year adjusted profit guidance. For the quarter ended on March 31st, total payment volumes grew 14% to $403.9 billion on increased global consumer spending that held up amid an uncertain economy. Net revenue climbed 10% to $7.7 billion. Aided by cost cuts, adjusted operating margin improved to 18.2%. For 2024, PayPal guided for adjusted profit growth in in mid-to-high single-digit percentages, while it previously forecasted it will remain flat. Focus on upgrades in attempt to win back investor support. PayPal is trying to woo investors by making efforts to become leaner as it focuses on achieving profitable growth. CEO Alex Chriss spoke of PayPal’s work to instill cost discipline, stating that management is “leaving no stone unturned when it comes to reducing unproductive costs”. While turning things around will likely take time and it is already taking longer than some expected, PayPal feels confident in its long-term opportunities as it already evolved from a checkout button to a platform of end-to-end solutions for both merchants and consumers. It’s no exaggeration to say that the digital wallet universe is a story of the clash of the titans, with PayPal going against Apple and against Google. Apple, Google and PayPal are competing for consumers’ wallets and the battle is as intense as it gets. Apply Pay is going from strength to strength, and it is also bringing the entire Apple ecosystem for the ride, seriously challenging PayPal whose days of dominating mobile payments are long gone. But PayPal is not giving its lunch to Apple nor anyone else by showing determination not to become obsolete. After all, it made a name for itself, and with a great name, it expanded into a supersized company, that on one hand is harder to steer, but on the other, it offers the broadest assortment of services to offer solutions that can supercharge a merchant's business. With its latest quarterly report, PayPal made it clear it will do whatever it takes to reignite growth of its branded offerings. DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

"OpenAI unveils newest AI model, GPT-4o",13/5/2024 19:38,"Clare Duffy, CNN13 May 2024 at 12:38 pm·4-min read","ChatGPT is about to become a lot more useful. OpenAI on Monday announced its latest artificial intelligence large language model that it says will make ChatGPT smarter and easier to use. The new model, called GPT-4o, is an update from the company’s previous GPT-4 model, which launched just over a year ago. The model will be available to unpaid customers, meaning anyone will have access to OpenAI’s most advanced technology through ChatGPT. Based on the company’s Monday demonstration, GPT-4o will effectively turn ChatGPT into a digital personal assistant that can engage in real-time, spoken conversations. It will also be able to interact using text and “vision,” meaning it can view screenshots, photos, documents or charts uploaded by users and have a conversation about them. OpenAI Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati said the updated version of ChatGPT will now also have memory capabilities, meaning it can learn from previous conversations with users, and can do real-time translation. “This is the first time that we are really making a huge step forward when it comes to the ease of use,” Murati said during the live demo from the company’s San Francisco headquarters. “This interaction becomes much more natural and far, far easier.” The new release comes as OpenAI seeks to stay ahead of the growing competition in the AI arms race. Rivals including Google and Meta have been working to build increasingly powerful large language models that power chatbots and can be used to bring AI technology to various other products. The OpenAI event came one day ahead of Google’s annual I/O developer conference, at which it’s expected to announce updates to its Gemini AI model. Like the new GPT-4o, Google’s Gemini is also multimodal, meaning it can interpret and generate text, images and audio. OpenAI’s update also comes ahead of expected AI announcements from Apple at its Worldwide Developers Conference next month, which could include new ways of incorporating AI into the next iPhone or iOS releases. Meanwhile, the latest GPT release could be a boon to Microsoft, which has invested billions of dollars into OpenAI to embed its AI technology into Microsoft’s own products. OpenAI executives demonstrated a spoken conversation with ChatGPT to get real-time instructions for solving a math problem, to tell a bedtime story and to get coding advice. ChatGPT was able to speak in a natural, human-sounding voice, as well as a robot voice — and even sang part of one response.

Apple says privacy is a ‘core value.’ Tim Cook shouldn’t compromise it to bridge the gap on AI,13/5/2024 15:55,Katie Paul13 May 2024 at 8:55 am·5-min read,"For years, Apple has positioned itself as a champion of consumer privacy, setting itself apart from its tech industry peers Google and Facebook and their ad-based business models that rely on siphoning up as much user data as possible. “Privacy is a fundamental human right,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said last year, repeating a mantra he has made a central part of Apple’s marketing strategy. But Apple’s privacy reputation is starting to show some major cracks—due to mounting revelations about its lucrative relationship with Google, which has been called “the pioneer of surveillance capitalism.” The U.S. government’s antitrust lawsuit against Google has produced some eye-popping numbers. According to recently unsealed court documents from the trial, Google paid Apple $20 billion in 2022 to make Google the default search engine on its Safari web browser. That’s up from a reported $18 billion payment in 2021. A Google witness at the trial testified that Google pays Apple 36% of the revenue it earns from search ads on Safari. The details of these transactions, which both companies had taken pains to keep secret, do much to undermine Apple’s rhetoric about being a defender of user privacy. They lay bare how Apple, a company that calls privacy a “core value,” has been profiting handsomely from Google, known for its voracious collection of personal data. (Google says it does its best to protect user data.) Far from seeking to distance itself from Google in the wake of these revelations, Apple appears to be open to expanding the relationship. According to Bloomberg News, Apple has held negotiations to use Google’s Gemini generative AI tools to power new features on the iPhone. The latest reports indicate Apple may be close to a deal with OpenAI but is still talking with Google. Apple is lagging behind other tech industry players in developing generative AI, and such a deal would be a quick way for the company to leapfrog ahead with the technology. However, an AI partnership with Google would raise yet more questions about Apple’s commitment to privacy. A recent investigation by the New York Times revealed that Google quietly revised its privacy policy last year in an apparent effort to expand the amount of user data available to train its generative AI models—and released the new language on the July 4 weekend to minimize scrutiny of the changes. By tapping into Google’s Gemini for the iPhone, Apple would be associating itself with these tactics. Whomever Apple ends up partnering with on AI, the company must be transparent with its users about where their data will go and how it will be used. Apple forged its privacy reputation in 2016 during its high-profile standoff with the FBI over an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino mass shooters. Apple famously refused the FBI’s request to unlock the device, warning it would create a “master key” that would break encryption and put the privacy and security of millions of Americans at risk. Cook called the case a “civil liberties” issue, putting privacy at the forefront of Apple’s corporate brand. In the years since, Apple has taken important steps to protect privacy, including features that require apps to get explicit permission from users to track their behavior and allow users to turn on end-to-end encryption for their messages and other data stored in Apple’s iCloud. But Apple’s deep entanglement with Google casts a large and growing shadow over the company’s claims to be a privacy savior. The fact that Apple is financially benefitting—to the tune of billions of dollars—from Google’s privacy-invasive search engine makes Apple marketing slogans like “What happens on your iPhone, stays on your iPhone” ring hollow. It also adds a distinct odor of hypocrisy to Cook’s frequent jabs at tech industry rivals over their data-hungry ways. At one 2015 event, where the Apple CEO was feted as a “Champion of Freedom” by a privacy advocacy group, Cook took aim at companies that are “gobbling up everything they can learn about you and trying to monetize it,” adding that “it’s not the kind of company that Apple wants to be.”",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-says-privacy-core-value-155530044.html,GOOG

Is Trending Stock Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) a Buy Now?,13/5/2024 13:00,Zacks Equity Research13 May 2024 at 6:00 am·5-min read,"Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term. Over the past month, shares of this company have returned +7%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Services industry, which Alphabet falls in, has gained 6.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction? Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision. Earnings Estimate Revisions Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings. Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements. Alphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.87 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +29.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +11.3%. The consensus earnings estimate of $7.66 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +32.1%. This estimate has changed +13.1% over the last 30 days. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.73 indicates a change of +13.9% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +12.5%. Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Alphabet is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-alphabet-inc-goog-130015472.html,GOOG

New audio capabilities enable users to speak to ChatGPT and obtain real-time responses with no delay, as well as interrupt ChatGPT while it is speaking, both hallmarks of realistic conversations that AI voice assistants have found challenging, the OpenAI researchers showed at a livestream event. ""It feels like AI from the movies ... Talking to a computer has never felt really natural for me; now it does,"" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote in a blog post. Microsoft-backed OpenAI faces growing competition and pressure to expand the user base of ChatGPT, its popular chatbot product that wowed the world with its ability to produce human-like written content and top-notch software code. At the livestream event, OpenAI researchers showed off ChatGPT's new voice assistant capabilities. In one demo, ChatGPT used its vision and voice capabilities to talk a researcher through solving a math equation on a sheet of paper. In another demo, researchers showed the GPT-4o model's capability of real-time language translation. OpenAI's demonstrations verged on science-fiction, with ChatGPT and its interlocutor at one point engaging in coquettish banter. The OpenAI researcher told the chatbot he was in a great mood because he was demonstrating ""how useful and amazing you are."" ChatGPT responded: ""Oh stop it! You're making me blush!"" Altman posted on X after the demo, ""her,"" in what appeared to be a reference to the so named 2013 film by Spike Jonze about a man falling in love with his AI assistant, voiced by Scarlett Johansson.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/openai-announce-chatgpt-product-improvements-090418859.html,GOOG
OpenAI to announce ChatGPT product improvements Monday,13/5/2024 9:00,Anna Tong13 May 2024 at 2:00 am·2-min read,"By Anna Tong May 13 (Reuters) - ChatGPT-maker OpenAI plans to announce on Monday updates to its flagship chatbot as its most advanced AI model GPT-4, which ""feels like magic,"" CEO Sam Altman said on X on Friday. The company said on X that it will hold a livestream conference on Monday at 10am PT (1700 GMT) to ""demo some updates to ChatGPT and GPT-4."" Reuters last week reported that the Microsoft -backed startup was planning an announcement Monday of an AI-powered search product one day ahead of Google's I/O developers conference, citing sources. But the company decided to delay the search product announcement, according to one source familiar with the matter. On Friday, CEO Sam Altman posted on X that the announcement would be ""not gpt-5, not a search engine, but we’ve been hard at work on some new stuff we think people will love! feels like magic to me."" OpenAI is under pressure to expand the user base of ChatGPT, its flagship chatbot product that wowed the world with its ability to produce humanlike written content and top-notch software code. Shortly after launching in late 2022, ChatGPT was called the fastest application to ever reach 100 million monthly active users. However, worldwide traffic to ChatGPT's website has been on a roller-coaster ride in the past year and is only now returning to its May 2023 peak, according to analytics firm Similarweb. Giving ChatGPT the search engine-like capability of accessing real-time, accurate web information is an obvious next step, and one that the current iteration of ChatGPT struggles with, industry experts have said. That would also put OpenAI in direct competition with Google, which has announced generative AI features for its own namesake search engine, and well-funded startup Perplexity, which has gained traction through providing an AI-native search interface that shows citations in results and images as well as text in its responses.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/openai-announce-chatgpt-product-improvements-090000472.html,GOOG
30 Highest Paid Jobs and Occupations in the US,12/5/2024 14:36,Afifa Mushtaque12 May 2024 at 7:36 am·10-min read,"In this article, we will look at the 30 highest paid jobs and occupations in the US. We have talked about the highest paying industries in the US. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 10 Highest Paid Jobs and Occupations in the US. The landscape of high-paying jobs in the US is largely dominated by tech and healthcare industries. In 2021, the average salary for technology professionals in the US increase to a record high of $104,566. Despite this increase, nearly half of tech workers expressed feeling underpaid. It is interesting to note that web developers experienced the most substantial pay raise, with salaries up by over 21.3%, while IT management positions commanded the highest average pay at $151,983. The tech industry's highest-growth positions included database administrators, technical support engineers, and data analysts. As companies transition to the cloud, roles such as software developers are expected to continue seeing salary increases which also indicates ongoing demand for specific skill sets. As long as the healthcare industry is concerned, healthcare jobs in the US have been a major contributor to job gains, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. In January, the healthcare sector added 70,000 jobs, making up nearly 20% of the total additions to the American workforce. This increase in hiring has been attributed to a shift towards a more permanent workforce in healthcare facilities, as hospitals move away from relying heavily on temporary staff, such as contract nurses, which were in high demand during the peak of the pandemic. It is also worth mentioning that healthcare remains one of the highest paying industries in the US. According to Salary.com, the average salary for a General Surgeon is $432,400, making it one of the highest-paying roles within the healthcare sector in the US. An Anesthesiologist follows closely with an average salary of $426,800, while a Medical Director commands an average salary of $322,484. Speaking of high salaries, US companies are observing a 33% increase in salaries for fully in-office roles that reached an average of $82,037 by March 2024, compared to $59,085 in 2023. This increase is essentially a push from employers to have their workforce back in physical offices. While hybrid and remote options persist, major corporations like Boeing and JPMorgan Chase are mandating full-time office attendance. The decision towards in-office work in the US, where 29% of paid workdays were still remote by January 2024, is driven by employers competing on pay rather than flexibility, according to ZipRecruiter. Conversely, in the UK and Europe, where remote work is less prevalent, the in-person premium trend is expected to be weaker. A survey in the UK in October 2023 showed that only 43% of workers had returned to fully in-office settings. Despite the cost-cutting climate, some employers are willing to increase wage bills for full offices as they believe it will lead to improved business outcomes. Nevertheless, compensation in the tech sector has been largely disappointing in recent times. For example, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) employees have received news of smaller-than-anticipated pay increases, with some even experiencing a decrease in their total compensation packages. This news came during the annual performance review period, typically when employees at Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) learn about adjustments to their salaries, bonuses, and equity grants. Historically, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) has been known for generous compensation packages, but this year, many employees found their raises smaller than in previous years. Reports indicated that some employees received base pay increases lower than 3% which is way less than the 8% to 10% increases seen in the past. Even those with outstanding performance ratings saw their total compensation decrease, primarily due to minimal raises in base salary, stagnant bonuses, and reduced equity rewards. On the other hand, on February 14, 2024, Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL) agreed to a $25 million settlement to resolve a class action lawsuit alleging gender-based pay discrimination which affected approximately 4,000 female employees in California. The case was filed in 2017 and claimed that Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL) paid male employees in similar roles up to $13,000 more annually than their female counterparts. Despite the settlement, Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL) did not admit any wrongdoing.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/30-highest-paid-jobs-occupations-143636843.html,GOOG
20 Best AI Content Detectors in 2024,11/5/2024 22:32,Talha Qureshi11 May 2024 at 3:32 pm·12-min read,"In this article, we will look at the 20 best AI content detectors in 2024. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Best AI Content Detectors in 2024. Content Marketing is a dynamic strategy that utilizes digital tools including text, images, videos, audio, and infographics to market content and services and retain potential audiences. According to a report by Mordor Intelligence, the global content marketing industry is expected to reach $263.09 billion in 2024. The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 14.75% during the forecasted period to reach $523.45 billion by 2029. Two of the leading factors driving growth in the industry are; the growing demand for digital transformation and online presence for business and the rise of AI-based content marketing. The global content marketing industry was revolutionized in 2022 due to the release of ChatGPT by OpenAI on November 30, 2022. ChatGPT is a large language model that uses Natural Language Processing (NPL) to produce human-like dialogue form responses to user's requests. The platform immediately gained attention and was used by over a million people during the first 5 days of its release. The number of ChatGPT users has increased drastically. According to the results from Similarweb recorded on 10th May 2024, the platform was visited by 1.8 billion people during the past 28 days. The release of ChatGPT by OpenAI led other leading technology companies to develop and release their language models. Subsequently, Gemini, Copilot, and Ernie were released by Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU), respectively. These platforms have fostered growth in the AI content creation tool market. According to a report by Future Market Insights, the AI content creation tools market was valued at $840.3 million in 2024. The market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 13.60% during the forecasted period to reach $3.01 billion by 2034. Looking at country-wise growth rates, the United States market is expected to grow at the fastest CAGR of 10.5% mainly due to its highly digitized economy and a wide range of businesses with a growing online presence.

The release of AI content generators threatened the jobs of content writers, journalists, and others associated with the industry. However, the world soon realized the limitations and potential issues linked to AI-generated content. The content generated using artificial intelligence software is redundant, based on hallucinated facts or imagined facts, spammy, and mostly plagiarized. On February 8, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) released its policy about AI-generated content stating that the appropriate use of AI or automation is not against Google’s policies, however content generated to spam and manipulate the search engine ranking is against Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) spam policy and will be penalized. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are two of the leading tech companies developing AI content generators. If you want to read more about AI companies you can look at 16 Biggest Publicly Traded AI Companies in the World. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is the developer of the large language model, Gemini. On February 22, Reuters reported that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) paused image generation at its AI platform Gemini due to inaccurate results for some historical depictions. Google started offering image generation using generative AI technology through Gemini during the initial days of February 2024. The tool was updated and on February 26th Google reported that it planned to relaunch the tool after fixing it. Here are some comments related to Gemini from Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Q1 2024 earnings call: ""The teams are making rapid progress, developing Gemini and other models. In February, we rolled out Gemini 1.5 Pro, which shows dramatic performance enhancements across a number of dimensions. It includes a breakthrough in long context understanding, achieving the longest context window of any large -scale foundation model yet. Combining this with Gemini’s native multimodal understanding across audio, video, text code, and more, it’s highly capable. We are already seeing developers and enterprise customers enthusiastically embrace Gemini 1.5 and use it for a wide range of things. Beyond Gemini, we have built other useful models, including our Gemma open models, as well as imagine visual models and others. Second, infrastructure leadership. We have the best infrastructure for the AI era."" Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is another leading technology company and the maker of Copilot, a large language model-based AI Chatbot. On March 30, Reuters reported that the US Congress has banned its staff from using Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) AI Copilot due to the risk of leaking data to non-House approved cloud servers. In response, the Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has announced a roadmap for its AI tools that meet the federal government’s security criteria and is intended to be delivered later this year. Moreover, over the last two years, two Democratic and two Republican senators have introduced legislation to ban the use of AI that creates false content depicting candidates related to federal election campaigns.

Are Robust Financials Driving The Recent Rally In Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Stock?,11/5/2024 11:00,editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St)11 May 2024 at 4:00 am·3-min read,"Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 13% over the last three months. Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. Specifically, we decided to study Alphabet's  ROE in this article. Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.  View our latest analysis for Alphabet  ROE can be calculated by using the formula: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Alphabet is: 28% = US$82b ÷ US$293b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024). The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.28 in profit. Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features. First thing first, we like that Alphabet has an impressive ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 7.4% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. Probably as a result of this, Alphabet was able to see a decent net income growth of 18% over the last five years.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/robust-financials-driving-recent-rally-110028401.html,GOOG
"Red, yellow, green ... and white? Smarter vehicles could mean big changes for the traffic light",11/5/2024 4:13,JEFF McMURRAY10 May 2024 at 9:13 pm·4-min read,"As cars and trucks get smarter and more connected, the humble lights that have controlled the flow of traffic for more than a century could also be on the cusp of a major transformation. Researchers are exploring ways to use features in modern cars, such as GPS, to make traffic safer and more efficient. Eventually, the upgrades could do away entirely with the red, yellow and green lights of today, ceding control to driverless cars. Henry Liu, a civil engineering professor who is leading a study through the University of Michigan, said the rollout of a new traffic signal system could be a lot closer than people realize. “The pace of artificial intelligence progress is very fast, and I think it’s coming,” he said. Traffic lights haven’t changed much in the U.S. over the years. Cleveland debuted what is considered the first “municipal traffic control system” in 1914, historian Megan Kate Nelson wrote for Smithsonian Magazine. Powered by the electricity from the city’s trolley line, engineer James Hodge’s invention featured two lights: red and green, the colors long used by railroads. A police officer sitting in a booth on the sidewalk had to flip a switch to change the signal. A few years later, Detroit police officer William Potts is credited with adding the yellow light, though as a city employee he couldn’t patent it. By 1930, Nelson wrote, all major American cities and many smaller ones had at least one electrical traffic signal. The advent of connected and automated vehicles, though, has presented a world of new possibilities for traffic signals. Among those reimagining traffic flows is a team at North Carolina State University led by Ali Hajbabaie, an associate engineering professor. Rather than doing away with today's traffic signals, Hajbabaie suggests adding a fourth light, perhaps a white one, to indicate when there are enough autonomous vehicles on the road to take charge and lead the way. “When we get to the intersection, we stop if it's red and we go if it's green,"" said Hajbabaie, whose team used model cars small enough to hold. “But if the white light is active, you just follow the vehicle in front of you.” Although Hajbabaie's research refers to a “white phase” and possibly even a white light, the specific color isn’t important, he said. Current lights could even suffice, say, by modifying them to flash red and green simultaneously to signal that driverless cars are in charge. The key would be making sure that it's universally adopted like the current signals are.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/red-yellow-green-white-smarter-041315522.html,GOOG
12 Best Marketing Stocks to Buy,10/5/2024 23:39,Affan Mir10 May 2024 at 4:39 pm·16-min read,"In this article, we discuss the 12 best marketing stocks to buy. To skip the detailed analysis of the industry, go directly to the 5 Best Marketing Stocks to Buy. The advertising and marketing industry is a vital component of the economy and it plays diverse roles in driving growth, nurturing innovation and creativity, and facilitating market efficiency. According to a report by Solomon Partners, the projections indicate that global advertising growth for 2024 is expected to range from 4.6% to 7.2%, nearly doubling the anticipated growth rate of 2% to 5% projected for 2023. Some of the major growth catalysts in the year for marketing and advertising companies are the Paris Olympics and the US elections. According to the report, the highest ad spending year-over-year growth is expected for out-of-home advertising at 7.2%, followed by digital ad spending at 6.3%. On the other hand, print ad spending is expected to decline by 4.6% year-over-year. In recent weeks, companies with digital advertisement segments saw a healthy rise in their ad revenues. Mega-cap tech stocks such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) beat their estimates and experienced a significant rise in their advertisement businesses. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) reported its earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, on April 24, posting an EPS of $4.71, up $0.39 from forecasts. The company’s revenue was up 27% year-over-year at $36.46 billion, ahead of estimates by $240 million. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) reported that the number of ad impressions delivered across its Family of Apps increased by 20%, compared to the previous year and the average price per ad was up 6% year-over-year. Nearly 98% of the company’s revenue comes from advertisements. At its Q1 2024 earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg made the following comments about integrating AI with its ad business: “...once our new AI services reach scale, we have a strong track record of monetizing them effectively. There are several ways to build a massive business here, including scaling business messaging, introducing ads or paid content into AI interactions, and enabling people to pay to use bigger AI models and access more compute. And on top of those, AI is already helping us improve app engagement which naturally leads to seeing more ads, and improving ads directly to deliver more value. So if the technology and products evolve in the way that we hope, each of those will unlock massive amounts of value for people and business for us over time.” Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) posted its earnings for the fiscal first quarter of 2024 on April 25 and reported an EPS of $1.89, exceeding EPS estimates by $0.38. The company's revenue was up 15.4% year-over-year at $80.54 billion. The company’s Google advertising segment reported revenues of $61.66 billion, showing an increase of over 13% year-over-year. Furthermore, YouTube ads generated a revenue of $8.09 billion, compared to $6.693 billion in the first quarter of 2023. Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) CEO, Sundar Pichai made the following comments at the company’s Q1 2024 earnings call: “We remain committed to all of this work. Finally, our monetization path. We have clear paths to AI monetization through ads and cloud, as well as subscriptions. Philip will talk more about new AI features that are helping advertisers, including bringing Gemini models into Performance Max. Our Cloud business continues to grow as we bring the best of Google AI to enterprise customers and organizations around the world. And Google One now has crossed 100 million paid subscribers. And in Q1, we introduced a new AI premium plan with Gemini Advanced. Okay, those are the six points. So now let me turn to quarterly highlights from Cloud and YouTube in a bit more detail. In Cloud, we have announced more than 1,000 new products and features over the past eight months.” While the above-mentioned companies generate most of their revenues from advertising and marketing, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is an e-commerce company. However, its ad revenue experienced the most noteworthy jump. On April 30, the company reported earnings for the fiscal first quarter of 2024. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) reported an EPS of $1.13 and beat EPS expectations by $0.30. The company's revenue surged by 12.5% year-over-year to $143.3 billion and beat Wall Street consensus by $763.92 million. The company’s advertising business brought in a revenue of $11.8 billion, up 24% year-over-year. Here is what Amazon.com, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) CEO, Andy Jassy said about its advertising business at the company’s Q1 2024 earnings call: “The strength in advertising was primarily driven by sponsored products, supported by continued improvements in relevancy and measurement capabilities for advertisers. We still see significant opportunity ahead in our sponsored products as well as areas where we’re just getting started like Prime Video ads. Prime Video ads offers brands value as we can better link the impact of streaming TV advertising to business outcomes like product sales or subscription sign-ups, whether the brands sell on Amazon or not. It’s very early for streaming TV ads but we’re encouraged by the early response. Moving to AWS. Year-over-year revenue growth accelerated to 17.2% in Q1, up from 13.2% in Q4. It’s useful to remember that year-over-year percentages are only relevant relative to the total base from which you start.” On February 28, Barclays highlighted Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) strategic focus on advertising investments and emphasized their significance in light of ongoing antitrust actions in the US and Europe, as well as the evolving landscape influenced by artificial intelligence, as reported by TheFly. The firm believes that the company’s advertising assets could potentially reach a value of $50 billion over time and can challenge Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in the advertisement segment. Barclays estimates the intrinsic worth of Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) advertising segment at $30 billion, largely propelled by platforms like LinkedIn and Bing, and anticipates a potential $20 billion surge in sales through aggressive distribution strategies.

"From Hype To Reality, AI Reshapes Pharmaceutical Industry Across Drug Discovery To Marketing - Stocks To Watch",10/5/2024 20:49,Vandana Singh10 May 2024 at 1:49 pm·3-min read,"Pharmaceutical companies have been at the forefront of artificial intelligence for quite some time. Researchers have been using advanced AI models to understand disease mechanisms even before the recent surge in interest. Wednesday, researchers at Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google DeepMind developed AlphaFold 3, a new artificial intelligence (AI) model. AlphaFold 3 can predict the structure and interactions of biological molecules. This includes proteins, DNA, RNA, and small molecules that could function as drugs. According to the latest McKinsey Global Institute report, AI technology could generate $60 billion—$110 billion annually in economic value for the pharmaceutical industry, as it can help speed up the process of identifying compounds, their development, and approval. The report adds that generative AI’s impact on pharmaceuticals is expected to be profound as the foundational models are built on languages, images, omics, patient information, and other types of data that come together to explain and solve the disease process and effective treatment ways. Increased drug discovery, approval, and marketing speed can help companies resolve the asset life cycle compression issue, which is the diminishing amount of time companies have to capture the value of the new drug. McKinsey’s research shows that the time has decreased to 9.8 years from 11.7 years over the past 20 years. Despite the speedy discovery, the average cost of discovering and developing new drugs has increased. Generative AI using augmented foundational models can help accelerate pharma research, with drug discovery timelines cut by almost half. AI tech can have a potential economic value of $15 billion-$28 billion on research and discovery. The report notes that, on average, ten years and around $1.4 billion are needed to bring one new drug to the market, of which 80% is associated with clinical development.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/hype-reality-ai-reshapes-pharmaceutical-204935555.html,GOOG
"With Apple entering the fight, the AI chip wars have gone nuclear",10/5/2024 15:05,Daniel Howley·Technology Editor10 May 2024 at 8:05 am·4-min read,"The artificial intelligence (AI) chip wars have officially kicked into high gear. On Tuesday, Apple (AAPL) unveiled its latest iPad Pro lineup, complete with the company’s all-new M4 chip. The processor, Apple says, features a 50% faster CPU than the prior generation Pro’s M2 chip, as well as a GPU with four times the performance of its predecessor. But Apple focused most on the M4’s neural engine, the portion of the chip dedicated to running AI applications. According to the company, the neural engine in the M4 is the company’s fastest yet, and it's more powerful than any neural processing unit available on today’s AI PCs. That might all seem like Apple puffing out its chest at the competition, and it is to a degree. But it also shows we’re entering a new era of PC marketing focused on the promise of generative AI applications running directly on our machines, rather than in the cloud. Microsoft (MSFT) is already pushing the category of AI PCs along with Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), Qualcomm (QCOM), and Nvidia (NVDA), and with Apple entering the fray, the battle over which company is the new AI champ has officially begun. The AI PC, or in the case of Apple AI iPad or AI Mac, is meant to be able to run smaller versions of the kinds of large language models that power apps like ChatGPT, Microsoft’s Copilot, and Google’s Gemini. In fact, Google (GOOG, GOOGL) already runs a version of its Gemini model called Gemini Nano on its Pixel smartphones. AI PCs are, generally, PCs that include neural processing units (NPUs), or in Apple’s case, a neural engine. These are essentially portions of a chip dedicated to powering AI applications. Intel’s Core Ultra chips, which it debuted in December, feature their own NPUs, while AMD has been showing off chips with its XDNA AI engine since May 2023. Qualcomm, for its part, has also joined the fight with its Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus chips. All of these chips should end up in Windows PCs on store shelves by the end of the year. Microsoft is already banking on AI PCs being a runaway success, going so far as to introduce a Windows keyboard button dedicated to its AI-powered Copilot software. It’s the first new keyboard button in nearly 30 years. Apple, on the other hand, has been building its neural engine into its chips since it launched its A11 processor in the iPhone X in 2017. The company has regularly touted its neural engine’s capabilities throughout the years, but the debut of the M4 chip marked the first time Apple started throwing out key performance metrics. During its press event unveiling the M4, Apple was sure to point out that it not only has been outfitting its chips with neural processing engines for years but that the M4 is capable of running 38 trillion operations per second (TOPS). TOPS is more or less a measurement of how well a chip can handle AI tasks. Qualcomm, for its part, says that its Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus chips offer 45 TOPS of performance. And according to CNET, Intel and AMD’s chips top out at 34 and 38 TOPS, respectively.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/with-apple-entering-the-fight-the-ai-chip-wars-have-gone-nuclear-150546931.html,GOOG

The interviewer then directs the conversation to discuss the volatility of the stock. The stock went down to $735 and $740 a couple of weeks ago, to which Kaiser emphasized how NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) poses a macro risk to the market, keeping in mind that it is priced for a significant swing of 10%. Companies like Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) went down double digitals, and big tech stocks, now stabilized, also have been down in correlation. To put NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) position into perspective, the company's earnings report and the way big and small tech companies react to it are extremely crucial to the AI space at the moment. The interviewer then questions how megacap tech stocks upheld their leadership position in the market. The interviewer highlights that the NASDAQ 100 hit a high in July last year and mid-January this year, and has been sideways since, relative to the S&P 500 index. Kaiser highlights the magnificent seven including, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet Inc.

He also suggested that the best-case scenario would be NVIDIA missing due to high demand and low supply, indicating that the market is still in high demand.

Here is What to Know Beyond Why Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) is a Trending Stock,10/5/2024 13:00,Zacks Equity Research10 May 2024 at 6:00 am·5-min read,"Alphabet (GOOGL) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock. Shares of this internet search leader have returned +6.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.2% change. The Zacks Internet - Services industry, to which Alphabet belongs, has gained 6.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term? Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision. Revisions to Earnings Estimates Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings. We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. For the current quarter, Alphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.84 per share, indicating a change of +27.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +9.9% over the last 30 days. For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.57 points to a change of +30.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +11.8%. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.63 indicates a change of +14% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +11.4%. Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Alphabet is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-alphabet-inc-130015003.html,GOOG

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free, here. A couple of weeks ago, I rewatched Jurassic Park for probably the 10th time since the movie came out 30 years ago. (As an aside, it really holds up — 10/10, no notes.) Early in the plot, when the guests are discussing their impressions of the park, Jeff Goldblum’s character (also 10/10, just perfect) launches into a speech so prescient you could sub out all the dinosaur stuff and map it onto the modern debate around artificial intelligence. “Don’t you see the danger, John, inherent in what you’re doing here? Genetic power is the most awesome force the planet’s ever seen, but you wield it like a kid that’s found his dad’s gun … You stood on the shoulders of geniuses to accomplish something as fast as you could, and before you even knew what you had, you patented it, and packaged it, and slapped it on a plastic lunchbox, and now you’re selling it.” And then comes the line that later launched a thousand memes: “Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn’t stop to think if they should.” Naturally, the skeptic of the group is dismissed as a Luddite and the movie carries on. (Spoiler alert: The Luddite was right!) AI skeptics — who are legion, and not necessarily part of the fringe tin foil hat crowd — are begging Silicon Valley to take a beat before unleashing AI to the world. But tech companies, faced with the most powerful computing innovation in a generation, are running around like kids who just found their dad’s gun. See here: Apple and Google — which, to be sure, deserve a lot of credit for the innovations they’ve brought to the world — have recently latched on to AI-powered features to help sell their newest tablets and smartphones. After all, throwing AI into your pitch deck is a surefire way to signal to shareholders that you’re on the cutting edge, which helps distract from the fact that your company hasn’t actually produced any significant proprietary tech in years. In marketing those new devices, though, Apple and Google have lost the plot.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/welcome-ai-dystopia-no-one-100003749.html,GOOG

Just a couple of weeks ago investors were fearing the worst. Inflation was coming in hot, interest rates cuts were off the table, and analysts were shouting about stagflation. Now just a few days later, broad equity indexes are again approaching all-time highs. All it took as a measly -6% selloff in the S&P 500 to start scaring investors out of positions in good stocks. When small pullbacks like the one at the end of April are met with vigorous buying like we saw these last couple weeks, you know the bull market is intact. The hiccups that cause mini selloffs are fantastic buying opportunities. The US economy is extremely robust in the face of record high interest rates. US household wealth is at all-time highs encouraging consumer spending, the US government is spending on big infrastructure projects such as semiconductors and nuclear energy, and though there may be a slight delay, expansionary monetary policy is on its way. Rising consumer and government spending grows earnings, and falling interest rates will increase liquidity. These are the driving factors in markets, and they are pointing to a continuing bull market now. Furthermore, this bull market is still in the early innings. Amazing businesses are still trading for very reasonable and even discount valuations and are ripe for the discerning investor. The Zacks Rank continuously amazes me with its ability to identify leading stocks, and here I will show you three of my favorites. Not only do these stocks have top Zacks Ranks, but they are also showing relative strength, cheap valuations, and have rock solid business fundamentals and growth. Google parent company Alphabet experienced some hefty upgrades to its earnings estimates this last week, boosting it to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating.

Google Stares Down Largest Tech Antitrust Ruling In 2 Decades — Is AT&T-Style Breakup Next?,9/5/2024 20:21,Natan Ponieman9 May 2024 at 1:21 pm·5-min read,"Closing arguments for the largest antitrust trial to date against Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), also known as Google, wrapped up last week. Now, it's up to Judge Amit Mehta to decide on a ruling that could change the fate of the company and others in the big tech space. Mehta, of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, is expected to come up with a decision before the end of the year. The case was put forth by the Justice Department in 2020, together with attorneys general from 11 states, who are arguing that Google has engaged in anti-competitive practices in order to maintain its dominance in the internet search space. Specifically, they're looking at the billions of dollars Google pays monthly to other tech companies in order to secure its place as the default search engine in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung, LG, Motorola owned by Lenovo Group Ltd (OTC:LNVGY) and other devices as well as in browsers like Mozilla Firefox and Opera. The plaintiffs argue that this practice prevents other companies from succeeding with their own search engine products, giving Google disproportionate market share in the search engine space. Last week, court documents revealed that Google paid Apple $20 billion in 2022 to be the default search engine on Safari, the web browser used on iPhone, iPad and Mac devices. In 2021, the figure amounted to $26.3 billion when including other browsers like Firefox. Google is estimated to account for about 90% of all internet searches, widely outpacing competitors like Microsoft Corp's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Bing, Yahoo Search or DuckDuckGo, a search engine that is privately owned and focused on user privacy. The final arguments from Google's attorneys as well as DOJ lawyer David Dahlquist followed a 10-week trial between September and November 2023. Read also: Google Fights Fortnite Maker’s Play Store Changes Amid Antitrust Battle: What’s at Stake? The case, however, was three years in the making for the Justice Department.

30 Most In-Demand Jobs in the US,9/5/2024 20:17,Afifa Mushtaque9 May 2024 at 1:17 pm·10-min read,"In this article, we will look at the 30 most in-demand jobs in the US. We have also discussed the growing unemployment claims in the US. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 10 Most In-Demand Jobs in the US. In the latest data release, weekly jobless claims in the US increased by 22,000 to reach 231,000 which is the highest level seen in over eight months. This uptick suggests a gradual cooling of the labor market, following reports of sluggish job growth in April and a decline in job openings to a three-year low in March. This trend has prompted discussions about potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, with two cuts this year now back on the table. The rise in jobless claims has been attributed to the end of school spring breaks which has complicated the process of seasonal adjustment in the data. Moreover, unadjusted claims increased by 19,690, with major spikes observed in states like New York, California, Illinois, Indiana, and Texas. To read more about joblessness, see 15 States With the Worst Unemployment Benefits in 2024. In line with the claims of joblessness, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has dramatically reduced its job postings in North America by slashing over 3,400 positions down to just three. This drastic cut has come in the wake of a challenging first quarter. The reduced job listings have primarily affected roles in California, Texas, and Nevada, where Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has the most important operations. The decision hints at a strategic reassessment of the company's hiring needs and operational focus. Beyond North America, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is also intensifying job cuts in China. However, The impact on Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA’s Chinese operations remains uncertain, with the company yet to comment on the scale of the cuts. On the other hand, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) has announced layoffs affecting at least 200 employees from its ""Core"" team based in California. These positions are being shifted overseas to offices in India and Mexico. The Core Systems & Experience division is responsible for Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s flagship products and global IT infrastructure. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) has also announced major layoffs within its global recruitment team. While Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)  assures that the layoffs are not part of a large-scale reduction and that the majority of the team will be retained for hiring essential positions, it's still an important development in the tech employment landscape. Reports indicate that Alphabet had already made substantial job cuts earlier in the year, slashing about 12,000 positions in January which constituted a 6% reduction in its workforce. These persistent layoffs also explain why 15% of US workers currently harbor feelings of job insecurity, despite unemployment rates hitting record lows. This phenomenon isn't accidental; it's a deliberate strategy in many workplaces aimed at motivating employees and cutting costs. Companies like Meta Platforms Inc and General Electric Co have openly admitted to leveraging the fear of job loss to spur performance, despite ample evidence of its detrimental effects on employees' well-being. While this tactic may suppress demands for raises and benefits, it comes at the cost of workers' social connections, identity, and overall health. Research indicates that job insecurity breeds a toxic work environment that comes with stress, resentment, and exhaustion. While 15% may indeed strive to enhance their performance and comply rigorously with company policies, the cognitive load imposed by insecurity undermines these efforts.

""A lot of things are really starting to click,"" Reddit co-founder and CEO Steve Huffman told Yahoo Finance on Thursday (video above).

Weekly active unique users rose 40% from the prior year. Total revenue improved 48% to $243 million, nearly doubling the growth rate from the prior quarter, due to strength in advertising. The company delivered adjusted operating profits of $10 million, versus a $50.2 million loss a year ago. Huffman declined to say when the company would be profitable on a net income basis, noting it's a focus for the management team. Other areas of focus include rolling out a new user interface this year, introducing shopping capabilities, and searching for another artificial intelligence content licensing deal like the one with Google (GOOG, GOOGL). ""Results this quarter show that Reddit is on the early end of a number of positive inflections: Top-of-funnel growth is accelerating, the ad platform is in the early stages of being built to address lower funnel objectives, the data licensing business is in the very early stages of growth, and the company is entering a harvest period in costs after aggressively adding to headcount over the last couple years,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Benjamin Black said in a client note. For Reddit, the quarter was another win for 2024. Initially expected to price its IPO in the $31 to $34 per share range, Reddit ended up pricing its IPO at $34 in late March, giving it a $6.4 billion valuation. The targeted valuation on a fully diluted basis was less than the $10 billion it fetched in a 2021 funding round.

"TikTok to label AI-generated images, video from OpenAI and elsewhere",9/5/2024 12:00,Stephen Nellis9 May 2024 at 5:00 am·2-min read,"By Stephen Nellis May 9 (Reuters) - TikTok said on Thursday it would start using a technology aimed at helping it label images and video generated by artificial intelligence and uploaded to the video sharing service. TikTok said it would adopt ""Content Credentials,"" a digital watermark that denotes how images were created and edited. The Content Credential technology was spearheaded by Adobe but is open for other companies to use and already has been adopted by companies such as ChatGPT creator OpenAI. Researchers have expressed concerned that AI-generated content could be used as misinformation in an attempt to interfere with U.S. elections this fall. TikTok was already among a group of 20 tech companies that earlier this year signed an accord pledging to fight it. YouTube, owned by Alphabet's Google, as well as Meta Platforms, which owns Instagram and Facebook, have also said they plan to use Content Credentials. For the system to work, both the maker of the generative AI tool used to make content and the platform used to distribute the contents must both agree to use the industry standard. If a person uses OpenAI's Dall-E tool to generate an image, for example, OpenAI attaches a watermark to the resulting image. If that marked image is then uploaded to TikTok, it will be automatically labeled as AI-generated. TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, has 170 million users in the United States, which recently passed a law requiring ByteDance to divest TikTok or face a ban. TikTok and ByteDance have sued to block the law, arguing it violates the First Amendment. TikTok already labels AI-generated content made with tools inside the app but the latest move would apply a label to content generated outside of the service.

The dividend, its importance demoted over the past couple of decades by the tech boom, is having a moment again thanks in part to the same companies that made it passé. In February, META (META) initiated a dividend, and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) followed in April. And then came an increase from Apple (AAPL) last week. But why are tech companies initiating payouts, and why now? The dividend trend reflects the double role that tech giants hold in society and on Wall Street.

Apple’s iPad event was an AI teaser for its future,9/5/2024 9:22,Daniel Howley·Technology Editor9 May 2024 at 2:22 am·3-min read,"Apple’s (AAPL) artificial intelligence push has begun. On Tuesday, the company unveiled its latest iPad Pros, which pack an all-new M4 processor. The chip provides the Pro with a number of benefits including a faster CPU and updated graphics processing unit. But it was Apple’s focus on the M4’s AI capabilities that stood out the most. Apple has been putting its neural engine into processors since 2017 and has previously talked up how it helps power a number of iPhone, iPad, and Mac features for some time. But the M4 unveiling was different, serving as an appetizer for the AI features the company will present at its WWDC event in June, when Apple is widely expected to debut a slew of generative AI-powered software features for its various devices. Apple pointed to a number of the M4’s AI bona fides during the keynote, with vice president of platform architecture Tim Millet specifically noting that the chip is capable of 34 trillion operations per second, a measurement commonly used when describing a chip’s AI performance. Millet also said that the M4’s neural engine is more powerful than any neural processing unit in any AI PC. That’s a direct shot at Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), and Qualcomm (QCOM), which are preparing to or are already rolling out their own AI PC chips designed to run large language models on Windows laptops and desktops. Outside of the M4’s AI processing fundamentals, Apple was mum on any substantive discussion of AI software updates. Sure, Millet said that the M4 helps the iPad Pro quickly isolate a subject from its background in a 4K video, but the M2-equipped iPad Air can do the same thing, just a bit slower. All the company had to offer was that the M4 would make AI apps and features run faster and more smoothly. The company also didn’t provide information about the M4’s performance while training or running large language models (LLMs), something that Intel, Qualcomm, and AMD regularly point to as indicators of their chips’ strengths. Still, the fact that Apple gave consumers, and Wall Street, an early look at its AI thinking is important. The company is widely viewed as behind the curve when it comes to the generative AI race, and investors are banking heavily on WWDC serving as Apple’s big AI coming-out party. CEO Tim Cook has been steadily mentioning AI more over the past few months and said during the company’s most recent earnings call that the iPhone maker is investing heavily in the technology.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/apples-ipad-event-was-an-ai-teaser-for-its-future-184058075.html,GOOG

Shareholders Are Optimistic That Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) Will Multiply In Value,20/5/2024 23:47,editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St)20 May 2024 at 4:47 pm·2-min read,"What are the early trends we should look for to identify a stock that could multiply in value over the long term? In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. With that in mind, the ROCE of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) looks attractive right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us. For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Meta Platforms, this is the formula: Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities) 0.29 = US$56b ÷ (US$223b - US$28b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024). So, Meta Platforms has an ROCE of 29%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Interactive Media and Services industry average of 6.4%.  View our latest analysis for Meta Platforms  Above you can see how the current ROCE for Meta Platforms compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free analyst report for Meta Platforms . We'd be pretty happy with returns on capital like Meta Platforms. The company has consistently earned 29% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 96% in that time. Returns like this are the envy of most businesses and given it has repeatedly reinvested at these rates, that's even better. If these trends can continue, it wouldn't surprise us if the company became a multi-bagger. In the end, the company has proven it can reinvest it's capital at high rates of returns, which you'll remember is a trait of a multi-bagger. And the stock has done incredibly well with a 159% return over the last five years, so long term investors are no doubt ecstatic with that result. So even though the stock might be more ""expensive"" than it was before, we think the strong fundamentals warrant this stock for further research. Like most companies, Meta Platforms does come with some risks, and we've found 1 warning sign  that you should be aware of.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/shareholders-optimistic-meta-platforms-nasdaq-234747443.html,META
Google remains focused on its long quest for your eyeballs,19/5/2024 12:00,Nick Robins-Early19 May 2024 at 5:00 am·6-min read,"Google announced this week that it would begin the international rollout of its new artificial intelligence-powered search feature, called AI Overviews. When billions of people search a range of topics from news to recipes to general knowledge questions, what they see first will now be an AI-generated summary. Google touted AI Overviews at its annual I/O developer conference as a way of delivering customers quick answers and simplifying the online search experience, but it also has another effect on the way that people engage with the internet: keeping users, and advertisers, on Google.com. It’s a new era in Google’s years-long quest for your attention. “Google will do the googling for you,” said Liz Reid, head of Google Search. While Google was once mostly a portal to reach other parts of the internet, it has spent years consolidating content and services to make itself into the web’s primary destination. Weather, flights, sports scores, stock prices, language translation, showtimes and a host of other information have gradually been incorporated into Google’s search page over the past 15 or so years. Finding that information no longer requires clicking through to another website. With AI Overviews, the rest of the internet may meet the same fate. Related: Google rolls out AI-generated, summarized search results in US Website owners are understandably concerned. Although Google’s demonstration gave the appearance that its AI could whisk its answers out of thin air, these overviews are built off content from news outlets, cooking blogs, product reviews and other articles that require human workers to write them. All of these sites rely on advertising revenue from people visiting their web pages, something that may no longer happen if users can get a summarized version of a site within seconds of searching. Google has tried to assuage publishers’ fears that users will no longer see their links or click through to their sites, with Reid stating during I/O that individual articles featured in AI Overviews get more traffic than if they were traditional web listings. The company has not mentioned whether it predicts overall search traffic will decline, however, and research firm Gartner predicts a 25% drop in traffic to websites from search engines by 2026 – a decrease that would be disastrous for most outlets and creators. AI Overviews are the culmination of a long line of products, going back almost two decades to the launch of its customized homepage, that have turned Google.com into its own self-contained online ecosystem. One of its first major advances in the amount of information Google would display on its search page came in 2012, with the debut of Knowledge Panels – boxes of information, usually taken from Wikipedia, that display basic information, photos and biographical details about a person or subject. Knowledge Panels expanded to the point that Google chief executive Sundar Pichai boasted in 2016 that they contained 70bn facts. Next came other services like stock prices and weather reports that would have previously required users to direct their attention to websites, causing alarm among outlets built around providing such information. When Google began featuring sports schedules on its page in 2013, TechCrunch ran an article titled “Google Embeds March Madness Bracket In Search, Because Screw Sports Sites”. As Google began to aggregate an increasing amount of information, concerns also grew around misinformation. Knowledge panels sometimes listed living persons as dead or automatically generated people’s job titles, regardless of why they might be public figures – leading to Google calling one of America’s worst mass murderers a “real estate investor”. AI Overviews have already started returning wrong answers.

Is Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) The Best AI Stock Pick of Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller?,17/5/2024 11:56,Fahad Saleem17 May 2024 at 4:56 am·4-min read,"Insider Monkey recently analyzed billionaire Druckenmiller's latest Q1'2024 portfolio to see which AI stocks the billionaire was buying. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is part of the 10 Best AI stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller. But the interesting question to answer is: Is Meta really the best AI pick of Druckenmiller? Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 242 After bagging huge profits from his Nvidia stake, billionaire Stanley Druckemiller is pouring money into the consumer-side AI companies that are using AI technologies to their advantage to boost and optimize online content consumption, including text, images and video. Stanley Druckenmiller's Duquesne Family Office bought a $31,043,000 stake in Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) during the first quarter of 2024. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), thanks to its multiple revenue streams and the huge user base it captures (Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp), can leverage AI to its advantage in a much efficient way when compared to peers. For example, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) plans to use 'Llama 3' LLM to introduce new automation features in its business messaging on Facebook. This technology, called ""Business AIs"", would help consumers get answers to their questions and will speed up the buying process. Analysts believe this could give further boost to online shopping on the platform. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) has also revealed Generative adversarial networks (GANs) technology to create images, text-to-video generative AI application called Make-A-Video and several other tools for consumers to play with AI, causing a rise in usage and engagement.

Meta Platforms Inc's (NASDAQ:META) management sensed the need to calm investors about this metric during the latest earnings call. Meta Platforms Inc's (NASDAQ:META) CFO Susan Li said: We anticipate our full year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $35 billion to $40 billion, increased from our prior range of $30 billion to $37 billion as we continue to accelerate our infrastructure investments to support our AI roadmap. While we are not providing guidance for years beyond 2024, we expect CapEx will continue to increase next year as we invest aggressively to support our ambitious AI research and product development efforts. On to tax. Absent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our full year 2024 tax rate to be in the mid-teens. In closing, Q1 was a good start to the year. We’re seeing strong momentum within our Family of Apps and are making important progress on our longer term AI and Reality Labs initiatives that have the potential to transform the way people interact with our services over the coming years.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-platforms-nasdaq-meta-best-115641736.html,META
EU investigates Facebook owner Meta over child safety and mental health concerns,16/5/2024 15:00,Jennifer Rankin in Brussels16 May 2024 at 8:00 am·3-min read,"The European Commission has opened an investigation into the owner of Facebook and Instagram over concerns that the platforms are creating addictive behaviour among children and damaging mental health. The EU executive said Meta may have breached the Digital Services Act (DSA), a landmark law passed by the bloc last summer that makes digital companies large and small liable for disinformation, shopping scams, child abuse and other online harms. “Today we open formal proceedings against Meta,” the EU commissioner for the internal market, Thierry Breton, said in a statement. “We are not convinced that it has done enough to comply with the DSA obligations to mitigate the risks of negative effects to the physical and mental health of young Europeans on its platforms Facebook and Instagram.” The investigation will explore potential addictive impacts of the platforms, known as “rabbit hole” effects, where an algorithm feeds young people negative content, such as on unrealistic body image. It will also look at the effectiveness of Meta’s age verification tools and privacy for minors. “We are sparing no effort to protect our children,” Breton said. A Meta spokesperson said: “We want young people to have safe, age-appropriate experiences online and have spent a decade developing more than 50 tools and policies designed to protect them. This is a challenge the whole industry is facing, and we look forward to sharing details of our work with the European Commission.” Last month the commission opened an inquiry into Meta under the DSA over its handling of political content amid concerns that it was not doing enough to counter Russian disinformation before the EU elections in June. Under the DSA, platforms are obliged to protect the privacy and safety of children. Following a preliminary investigation, EU officials are concerned that Facebook and Instagram “may exploit the weaknesses and inexperience of minors and cause addictive behaviour”. They are also sceptical about the platform’s age-verification tools. Users are meant to be at least 13 years old to open an account on Facebook or Instagram. One official said that it was “so obviously easy to circumvent some controls” that the commission wanted to know how it was ever assessed by Meta that these measures could be effective and appropriate. An EU official said on Thursday that the commission wanted to use the bloc’s European digital identity wallet for age verification.

The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, will consider whether Meta (META) has complied with its obligations under the Digital Services Act (DSA), the bloc’s sweeping new law for online platforms.

D.C. is testing its Big Tech antitrust campaign far from D.C.,16/5/2024 8:00,Alexis Keenan·Reporter16 May 2024 at 1:00 am·6-min read,"The Biden administration is testing its antitrust push far from Washington as it seeks to unwind the dominance of Big Tech. No longer is the nation’s capital the go-to trial venue of choice for the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission as they file competition challenges against the biggest names in Silicon Valley. Instead, it’s New Jersey where the government chose to sue Apple (AAPL). Or California, where it challenged Microsoft (MSFT). Or the state of Washington, where it confronted Amazon (AMZN). Or Virginia, where it filed a second antitrust suit against Google (GOOG, GOOGL). ""They’re clearly filing these tech cases in different jurisdictions where the law is less developed,"" said Douglas Ross, a professor of antitrust at the University of Washington School of Law. ""And they're doing it for a reason."" A variety of strategies could explain the multi-jurisdictional approach, according to antitrust lawyers. Prosecutors could be targeting appeals courts with case law more favorable to their legal theories, since all of the district courts selected by Biden’s FTC and DOJ report to different courts of appeals. The government could also be weighing the speed of a court in handling litigation and the convenience to anticipated witnesses, said Juan Arteaga, a partner with Crowell & Moring’s antitrust litigation division. It’s also possible, he added, that government officials may want to showcase vigorous anticompetitive enforcement to the rest of the country. ""I think the current leadership team and the DOJ antitrust division have really made it a point to try to take antitrust enforcement out of the D.C. bubble,"" Arteaga said. Ross is more skeptical of a strategy that seeks out jurisdictions where judges have less antitrust experience and fewer controlling antitrust cases are on the books.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/dc-is-testing-its-big-tech-antitrust-campaign-far-from-dc-080007707.html,META

The removal had drawn complaints from Malaysia's government, a vocal supporter of the Palestinian cause and which has warned that firm action could be taken against Meta and other social media companies if they were blocking pro-Palestinian content on their platforms. Anwar met Ismail Haniyeh of Hamas in Qatar on Monday. He later stressed that though he had good relations with the group's political leaders, he had no involvement in its military apparatus.

"Meta to shut Workplace app to focus on AI, metaverse",14/5/2024 17:33,Reuters14 May 2024 at 10:33 am·1-min read,"(Reuters) - Meta Platforms will discontinue its work-focused Workplace app as the company shifts its focus on building artificial intelligence and metaverse technologies, the Facebook parent said on Tuesday. Workplace will be shuttered starting June 2026 for customers but Meta will continue to use it as its internal messaging board, the company said, adding users can continue to access the product until August 2025. ""We are discontinuing Workplace (to) focus on building AI and metaverse technologies that we believe will fundamentally reshape the way we work. Over the next two years, we will provide our Workplace customers the option to transition to Zoom's Workvivo product, Meta's only preferred migration partner,"" a Meta spokesperson said. The enterprise communications app, Workplace, was first introduced for businesses in 2016 with new features including multi-company groups and shared spaces that allowed employees from different organizations to work together. The move comes as the social media giant has been investing heavily in AI products and metaverse - a shared virtual environment that it bets will be the successor to the mobile internet - stoking concerns of surging costs that could hit growth. The company said the billing and payment arrangements will remain the same for Workplace customers until August this year. Workplace currently offers a monthly core plan of $4 per user, which can be upgraded with add-ons starting from $2 per user each month.

Kennedy Jr and a super PAC supporting him filed a lawsuit on Monday against Facebook parent Meta Platforms, alleging the tech giant interfered in the election after it blocked a political advertisement. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in San Francisco by Kennedy and the American Values 2024 super PAC, which paid for the advertisement, a 30-minute video about Kennedy's life, says Meta censored the video by removing it and blocking users on its platforms from watching, sharing or posting a link to it. Meta owns the Facebook, Instagram, Threads and WhatsApp platforms. The lawsuit said Meta began censoring the May 3 video ""within minutes"" and cited a statement from Meta on May 5 that said the video was no longer being censored. The lawsuit claims the film is still being blocked for users. ""Defendants seem to believe that they can with legal impunity issue threats to their users and deploy their vast power of censorship, account-suspension, and deplatforming in order to favor or target the presidential candidate of their choice,"" the lawsuit stated. Meta declined to comment on the lawsuit. A Meta spokesperson in a statement last week said: ""The link was mistakenly blocked and was quickly restored once the issue was discovered."" After the ad was blocked, Kennedy and scores of others took to social media to criticize what they said was an injustice. Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of social media platform X, reposted the video on X, saying it was ""worth watching."" The video, called ""Who Is Bobby Kennedy"" and narrated by actor Woody Harrelson, is a 30-minute dive into Kennedy's life, famed family, and the media's ""crank"" perception of him.

Are You a Growth Investor?

Meta Platforms (META) Meta Platforms is the world’s largest social media platform. The company’s portfolio offering evolved from a single Facebook app to multiple apps like photo and video sharing app Instagram and WhatsApp messaging app owing to acquisitions. Along with in-house developed Messenger, these apps now form Meta’s family of products used by almost 3.24 billion people on a daily basis as of Mar 31, 2024.

"Is Trending Stock Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) a Buy Now?",13/5/2024 13:00,Zacks Equity Research13 May 2024 at 6:00 am·5-min read,"Meta Platforms (META) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future. Over the past month, shares of this social media company have returned -7%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which Meta Platforms falls in, has lost 5.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction? While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making. Revisions to Earnings Estimates Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock. We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. For the current quarter, Meta Platforms is expected to post earnings of $4.66 per share, indicating a change of +44.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.2% over the last 30 days. For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $20.10 points to a change of +35.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.3%. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.12 indicates a change of +15% from what Meta Platforms is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.9%. Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Meta Platforms is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-meta-platforms-inc-130014229.html,META

(NASDAQ:META) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward. Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.  Check out our latest analysis for Meta Platforms  We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value: 2024 2025",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/calculating-intrinsic-value-meta-platforms-110025945.html,META
Big Tech sees neurotechnology as its next AI frontier,13/5/2024 10:00,Madison Mills·Host and Reporter13 May 2024 at 3:00 am·6-min read,"Neurotechnology using artificial intelligence is opening up new possibilities in healthcare that previously didn’t exist. For decades companies and researchers have been exploring implantable devices that interpret signals in the brain and translate them into words or physical commands. The technology is not new, but now, artificial intelligence is accelerating advances, allowing people affected by debilitating diseases to communicate in ways that were physically impossible before. These devices have been game changers for people like Rodney, a patient living with ALS who had a Stentrode device implanted in his brain. The device, which was developed by Synchron, a neurotech company backed by Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and Microsoft’s Bill Gates, contains a tiny electrode that converts brain signals into physical actions, allowing Rodney to type on a keyboard using only his thoughts. While neurotechnology can be empowering for patients like Rodney, AI could make less invasive neurotech more accessible for everyday consumers and spur the next generation of consumer-facing tech products. According to Precedence Research, the market for neurotech devices was valued at around $15 billion in 2023, and it's projected to reach over $55 billion by 2032. That's a major reason why Big Tech companies like Meta (META) and Apple (AAPL) are backing research into devices that can decode thoughts and perceptions without requiring invasive surgery. But as Big Tech moves ahead to build off neurotech advancements in the medical world, experts have cautioned that it could put our most valuable data — the privacy of our thoughts — at risk. “This is our final fortress of privacy, and we've given up every other aspect of privacy that exists,” said Nita Farahany, a futurist, tech ethicist, and author of “The Battle for Your Brain.” Elon Musk’s Neuralink made headlines early this year when the company implanted its first human patient with a brain-computer interface (BCI), though the company said on Thursday it encountered some issues with the implant. The Neuralink implant, which has over 1,000 electrodes and 64 threads, experienced a malfunction after a number of threads retracted from the brain, which decreased the number of effective electrodes. In a blog post, the company said this would not negatively impact how the implant works. Musk is not the only CEO trying to make neurotechnology a reality. At least 30 companies are currently selling neurotechnology or developing the technology.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/big-tech-sees-neurotechnology-as-its-next-ai-frontier-100022978.html,META

Earlier this month, billionaire Ken Fisher, while talking to Bloomberg, said that in his career spanning 50 years he never spent a ""moment"" thinking or worrying about what the central banks ""might do."" Why? Because Fisher said he's ""always believed"" that ""they are just about as crazy and out of their minds as you can be."" Fisher, 73, said that the central bank management ""never"" knows what to do as it's reactive. To drive this point home, Fisher reminded everyone that just a month before the Fed's first 75bps rate hike, Fed Chair Jerome Powell had said that he was not even ""thinking about"" raising rates by 75bps. Ken Fisher has been bullish on the economy over the past several months. Rate hikes, the inflation storm, banking crisis and global uncertainty did not waver Fisher's belief that we will come out of this crisis unscathed. But in his latest interview Fisher voiced concerns about some of the threats he believes are not yet ""priced in."" Fisher is worried about ""big surprises"" that can impact global stocks and global GDP. Fisher said in financial markets everyone is usually worried about more or less the same things. But sometimes threats can slip through the cracks and we don’t see them coming. Ken Fisher said a classic example of this surprise is mark-to-market accounting rules implemented in 2007 which ""hugely took the mortgage problem and amplified it to write $2 trillion off of global bank balance sheets."" However, Fisher reiterated that he's bullish on the market right now. ""But whenever I am bullish I am still looking for risks."" Fisher's worries about the geopolitical chessboard stem from what he called the nuclear-armed triangle: China, India and Pakistan. Fisher said these three nations have different economies, politics and culture and they ""usually don’t like each other."" While Fisher thinks the odds of war in the region are not high, he doesn’t think such a war is ""impossible"" and fears any conflict between the nuclear powers in Asia would be ""catastrophic."" When asked about what sectors he's looking as bargains, Fisher said he wouldn’t call them ""bargains"" because ""valuations don’t usually tell you much about short to intermediate term stock price direction."" Instead, Fisher is looking for sectors that would do ""pretty well"" in a moderate growth economy with a ""slowly decelerating inflation"" environment.""",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/billionaire-ken-fisher-loves-10-200530508.html,META
25 Careers with the Most Job Security in the US,12/5/2024 14:23,Afifa Mushtaque12 May 2024 at 7:23 am·11-min read,"In this article, we will look at the 25 careers with the most job security in the US. We have also talked about growing concerns about job insecurity due to AI. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 10 Careers with the Most Job Security in the US. According to a study conducted by Authority Hacker, with a sample of 1200 full-time workers, job insecurity looms large over the American workforce as over half of full-time employees express growing concerns. Strikingly, the tech industry which is largely believed to be synonymous with innovation, is witnessing an increase in anxiety, attributed to recurrent mass layoffs and the specter of AI replacing human roles. According to the survey, men exhibit a higher propensity for job insecurity compared to women, with those earning $150,000 or more exhibiting the highest concern. Moreover, professions most vulnerable to AI disruption such as IT, software development, and advertising, report the most severe cases of anxieties. It is also interesting to note that one of the most vulnerable jobs to AI are that of customer service representatives which are also known to have the most oversaturated jobs. Apart from concerns of job insecurity due to AI, job insecurity has been a persistent concern, especially during economic downturns in the US. Despite claims that recessions have become less common over time, skepticism remains due to historical data discrepancies. According to Business Insider, between 1990 and 2023, the US experienced 36 months of recession, compared to 59 months between 1960 and 1989. However, the reliability of recession data before 1950 is questionable which potentially skewes perceptions of historical recession frequency. Speaking of economic downturns, in April 2024, the US observed a major slowdown in job growth as employers only added 175,000 positions. This trend was accompanied by a rise in the unemployment rate from 3.8% to 3.9%, according to the Labor Department. The Federal Reserve's decision to increase interest rates since 2022 also aimed to temper economic expansion and alleviate inflationary pressures. However, with inflation remaining above the bank's 2% target at 3.5% in March, there were doubts about the timing of further rate cuts. Nonetheless, the unexpected slowdown in job growth in April raised expectations for potential rate adjustments later in the year. Despite the tempered job growth, some sectors like healthcare, continued to drive employment gains. Average hourly earnings rose by 3.9% over the 12 months to April, albeit at a slower pace compared to the previous month. Now that we are talking about job gains, it is worth highlighting that Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is set to construct an $800 million data center spanning 715,000 square feet in Montgomery, Alabama. This data center is anticipated to generate 100 job opportunities. Located near the Interstate 65 and Hyundai's automotive assembly plant, the site was announced by Governor Kay Ivey at Montgomery Whitewater and is slated for completion by 2026. Over 1,000 construction workers are expected to be engaged at the peak of its construction. This is one of the most significant investments by Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) in Alabama, following the establishment of its first data center campus in Huntsville in 2021, which currently employs approximately 300 individuals. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)’s total investment in the state amounts to $1.5 billion. Montgomery will become home to Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)’s 24th data hub and its 20th in the United States. The city was selected owing to its accessibility to infrastructure, renewable energy availability, and a rich pool of talent. Once operational, the facility is slated to achieve LEED Gold certification, utilize 100% renewable energy, and attain net-zero emissions. On the other hand, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services (AWS) has announced a monumental investment of $11 billion in Indiana which is expected to generate a minimum of 1,000 job opportunities.

UPDATE 1-Musk's X Corp loses lawsuit against Israeli data-scraping company,10/5/2024 17:19,Jonathan Stempel10 May 2024 at 10:19 am·2-min read,"(Adds comment from Bright Data CEO, Meta lawsuit against Bright Data, paragraphs 6, 8) By Jonathan Stempel May 10 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge dismissed a lawsuit in which Elon Musk's X Corp accused an Israeli data-scraping company of illegally copying and selling content, and selling tools that let others copy and sell content, from the social media platform. U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco ruled on Thursday that X, formerly Twitter, failed to plausibly allege that Bright Data Ltd violated its user agreement by allowing the scraping and evading X's own anti-scraping technology. Alsup said using scraping tools is not inherently fraudulent, and giving social media companies free rein to decide how public data are used ""risks the possible creation of information monopolies that would disserve the public interest."" The judge also said X was not entitled to ""de facto copyright ownership"" in copyrighted content that X's users made available to the public. Lawyers for X did not immediately respond on Friday to requests for comment. Or Lenchner, Bright Data's chief executive, said in a statement: ""Bright Data's victory over X makes it clear to the world that public information on the web belongs to all of us, and any attempt to deny the public access will fail."" Alsup said X can try to amend its complaint, which sought unspecified compensatory and punitive damages for breach of contract, trespass and misappropriation. The San Francisco-based company sued Bright Data last July. In January, another San Francisco judge ruled that Bright Data had not violated Meta Platforms' terms of service by scraping data from Facebook and Instagram. Meta ended its lawsuit against Bright Data a month later.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/1-musks-x-corp-loses-171921106.html,META
Is AI lying to me? Scientists warn of growing capacity for deception,10/5/2024 15:00,Hannah Devlin Science correspondent10 May 2024 at 8:00 am·3-min read,"They can outwit humans at board games, decode the structure of proteins and hold a passable conversation, but as AI systems have grown in sophistication so has their capacity for deception, scientists warn. The analysis, by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) researchers, identifies wide-ranging instances of AI systems double-crossing opponents, bluffing and pretending to be human. One system even altered its behaviour during mock safety tests, raising the prospect of auditors being lured into a false sense of security. “As the deceptive capabilities of AI systems become more advanced, the dangers they pose to society will become increasingly serious,” said Dr Peter Park, an AI existential safety researcher at MIT and author of the research. Park was prompted to investigate after Meta, which owns Facebook, developed a program called Cicero that performed in the top 10% of human players at the world conquest strategy game Diplomacy. Meta stated that Cicero had been trained to be “largely honest and helpful” and to “never intentionally backstab” its human allies. “It was very rosy language, which was suspicious because backstabbing is one of the most important concepts in the game,” said Park. Park and colleagues sifted through publicly available data and identified multiple instances of Cicero telling premeditated lies, colluding to draw other players into plots and, on one occasion, justifying its absence after being rebooted by telling another player: “I am on the phone with my girlfriend.” “We found that Meta’s AI had learned to be a master of deception,” said Park. The MIT team found comparable issues with other systems, including a Texas hold ’em poker program that could bluff against professional human players and another system for economic negotiations that misrepresented its preferences in order to gain an upper hand. In one study, AI organisms in a digital simulator “played dead” in order to trick a test built to eliminate AI systems that had evolved to rapidly replicate, before resuming vigorous activity once testing was complete. This highlights the technical challenge of ensuring that systems do not have unintended and unanticipated behaviours. “That’s very concerning,” said Park. “Just because an AI system is deemed safe in the test environment doesn’t mean it’s safe in the wild. It could just be pretending to be safe in the test.” The review, published in the journal Patterns, calls on governments to design AI safety laws that address the potential for AI deception. Risks from dishonest AI systems include fraud, tampering with elections and “sandbagging” where different users are given different responses. Eventually, if these systems can refine their unsettling capacity for deception, humans could lose control of them, the paper suggests.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-lying-scientists-warn-growing-150021713.html,META

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to 5 Biggest Publicly Traded AI Companies in the World. On May 8, Stuart Kaiser, Citi's Head of Equity Trading Strategy, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance where he discussed the role of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in shaping the market for artificial intelligence. Kaiser suggests that the company's earnings report may be the biggest event to look forward to right now, especially for equity holders, according to the S&P 500 index. He also highlighted that if the 10-year rate was pinned at 4.75%, equities would not be largely impacted if NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) misses earnings on May 22nd. The interviewer then directs the conversation to discuss the volatility of the stock. The stock went down to $735 and $740 a couple of weeks ago, to which Kaiser emphasized how NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) poses a macro risk to the market, keeping in mind that it is priced for a significant swing of 10%. Companies like Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) went down double digitals, and big tech stocks, now stabilized, also have been down in correlation. To put NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) position into perspective, the company's earnings report and the way big and small tech companies react to it are extremely crucial to the AI space at the moment. The interviewer then questions how megacap tech stocks upheld their leadership position in the market. The interviewer highlights that the NASDAQ 100 hit a high in July last year and mid-January this year, and has been sideways since, relative to the S&P 500 index.

Australia targets social media with parliamentary probe,10/5/2024 2:05,Renju Jose9 May 2024 at 7:05 pm·2-min read,"By Renju Jose SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia announced on Friday that it would hold a parliamentary inquiry to look into the negative impacts of social media platforms, saying they have significant reach and control over what Australians see online, with almost no scrutiny. The government has criticised social media platforms for not being quick enough to remove violent posts and seeks more oversight over content posted on Meta's Facebook, ByteDance's TikTok and Elon Musk-owned X. ""Across a range of issues, whether it be the issue of domestic violence, whether it be the radicalisation of our young people, across a range of areas, something that keeps popping up over and over again is the role of social media,"" Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters. ""(They) can be very positive but also can have a negative influence which is there."" Albanese's Labor government is already in a legal fight with Musk's X over a regulatory order asking the platform to take down videos of the stabbing attack on an Assyrian church bishop in Sydney last month. X said it has blocked the posts for Australian users, but Australia's e-Safety Commissioner says the content should be taken down for all users since it shows explicit violence. Musk has posted memes criticising Albanese, describing the government's decision as censorship. The joint parliamentary select committee will also check Meta's decision to withdraw from paying for news in Australia. Meta declined to comment on the inquiry. Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said Parliament needed to understand how social media companies ""dial up and down the content that supports healthy democracies, as well as the anti-social content that undermines public safety.""",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/australia-targets-social-media-parliamentary-020500301.html,META

""A lot of things are really starting to click,"" Reddit co-founder and CEO Steve Huffman told Yahoo Finance on Thursday (video above). The company this week reported its first results since going public in late March — and there was much to prove the bears wrong. Daily active users increased 37% year over year to 82.7 million. Weekly active unique users rose 40% from the prior year. Total revenue improved 48% to $243 million, nearly doubling the growth rate from the prior quarter, due to strength in advertising. The company delivered adjusted operating profits of $10 million, versus a $50.2 million loss a year ago. Huffman declined to say when the company would be profitable on a net income basis, noting it's a focus for the management team. Other areas of focus include rolling out a new user interface this year, introducing shopping capabilities, and searching for another artificial intelligence content licensing deal like the one with Google (GOOG, GOOGL). ""Results this quarter show that Reddit is on the early end of a number of positive inflections: Top-of-funnel growth is accelerating, the ad platform is in the early stages of being built to address lower funnel objectives, the data licensing business is in the very early stages of growth, and the company is entering a harvest period in costs after aggressively adding to headcount over the last couple years,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Benjamin Black said in a client note. For Reddit, the quarter was another win for 2024. Initially expected to price its IPO in the $31 to $34 per share range, Reddit ended up pricing its IPO at $34 in late March, giving it a $6.4 billion valuation.

Investigation into child exploitation on Meta platforms leads to arrests of three men,9/5/2024 16:50,"Clare Duffy, CNN9 May 2024 at 9:50 am·4-min read","An investigation by the New Mexico Attorney General into the potential dangers of Meta’s platforms has resulted in the arrests of three men charged with attempted sexual abuse of children. The arrests came after a months-long investigation by the attorney general’s office into the risks of sexual exploitation of children on Facebook and Instagram. That investigation also formed the basis of a lawsuit against Meta, filed in December, accusing the tech giant of creating a “breeding ground” for child predators. Meta has pushed back against the claims in the lawsuit and says it offers dozens of safety tools for children and parents. As part of the investigation, the attorney general’s office created multiple fake Facebook and Instagram profiles posing as children, which the suit alleges were served sexually suggestive content and, in some cases, were urged by other users to send pornographic content of themselves. The fake child accounts were also allegedly contacted and solicited for sex by the three New Mexico adult men whose arrests were announced by the attorney general on Wednesday. Two of the three men were arrested at a motel, where they allegedly believed they would be meeting up with a 12-year-old girl, based on their conversations with the decoy accounts. “This is (Meta CEO) Mark Zuckerberg’s fault,” New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez said in a press conference announcing the arrests Wednesday. “This is the fault of a company that has extraordinary resources at its disposal and has chosen time and again to place profits over the interests of children.” A Meta spokesperson told CNN that “child exploitation is a horrific crime and we’ve spent years building technology to combat it and to support law enforcement in investigating and prosecuting the criminals behind it.” “This is an ongoing fight, where determined criminals evolve their tactics across platforms to try and evade protections,” the spokesperson said. “We use sophisticated technology, hire child safety experts, report content to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and share information and tools with other companies and non-profits to help root out predators across the many platforms they use.” News of the arrests could add to the growing scrutiny that Meta – like other social media companies – faces over the safety of young users on its platforms. Lawmakers, parents and online safety advocates, as well as several separate lawsuits, have raised concerns about the impact of Meta’s platforms on teens’ mental health, body image and overall wellbeing. In January, Zuckerberg apologized to families who said their children had been harmed by using social media during a Senate committee hearing about online youth safety. In January — after Torrez’s lawsuit was filed and ahead of the Senate hearing — Meta rolled out additional youth safety features, including updating teens’ default privacy settings to restrict anyone they don’t follow from messaging them, including other teens. The move came after Meta in 2021 restricted adults over age 19 from messaging teens who don’t follow them.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/investigation-child-exploitation-meta-platforms-165047596.html,META
Meta's oversight board backs takedown of Australian voter fraud posts,9/5/2024 12:05,Byron Kaye9 May 2024 at 5:05 am·2-min read,"By Byron Kaye SYDNEY (Reuters) - Meta's oversight board upheld a decision to remove two Facebook posts calling for Australians to vote multiple times in an indigenous rights referendum, but noted the social media giant had not adequately explained its ban on encouraging voter fraud. The board, which is funded by Meta but run independently, said Meta was correct to protect the democratic process by preventing voter fraud when it proactively pulled the posts ahead of the 2023 vote. But Meta's public-facing rules were not clear enough, the board said in a ruling published on Thursday. ""Since it is crucial that users can engage on social media to discuss public-interest issues about democratic events, Meta needs to clearly inform users of the rules,"" it said. The decision comes as Australia's government plans to introduce penalties for internet platforms which fail to rein in misinformation and disinformation. Last October, Australians voted down a proposal to constitutionally recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people amid fears that a misinformation campaign was influencing voters. In the posts under review, two Facebook users separately uploaded screenshots showing partial statements posted by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) on X (formerly Twitter). The screenshots showed the words ""if someone votes at two different polling places within their electorate, and places their formal vote in the ballot box at each polling place, their vote is counted"". The posts failed to mention that voting multiple times is an offence in Australia. One Facebook user shared the screenshot with the caption ""vote early, vote often, and vote NO"", while the other user posted the screenshot with the comment: ""so you can vote multiple times ... they are setting us up for a 'rigging' ... smash the voting centres ... it's a No, No, No, No, No"". In both cases, Meta proactively identified the posts, which were automatically sent for human review before being removed, but the users appealed the decision, the oversight board said.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/metas-oversight-board-backs-takedown-120548513.html,META
Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) Could Easily Take On More Debt,9/5/2024 12:00,editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St)9 May 2024 at 5:00 am·4-min read,"Warren Buffett famously said, 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. Importantly, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky. Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together.  View our latest analysis for Meta Platforms  You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that as of March 2024 Meta Platforms had US$18.4b of debt, an increase on US$9.93b, over one year. But on the other hand it also has US$58.1b in cash, leading to a US$39.7b net cash position. We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Meta Platforms had liabilities of US$28.1b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$45.2b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$58.1b in cash and US$13.4b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling US$1.77b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined. Having regard to Meta Platforms' size, it seems that its liquid assets are well balanced with its total liabilities. So it's very unlikely that the US$1.19t company is short on cash, but still worth keeping an eye on the balance sheet. While it does have liabilities worth noting, Meta Platforms also has more cash than debt, so we're pretty confident it can manage its debt safely. On top of that, Meta Platforms grew its EBIT by 72% over the last twelve months, and that growth will make it easier to handle its debt. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Meta Platforms can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts. Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. Meta Platforms may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. During the last three years, Meta Platforms generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 80% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That puts it in a very strong position to pay down debt. While it is always sensible to look at a company's total liabilities, it is very reassuring that Meta Platforms has US$39.7b in net cash. The cherry on top was that in converted 80% of that EBIT to free cash flow, bringing in US$50b. So we don't think Meta Platforms's use of debt is risky. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. These risks can be hard to spot. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Meta Platforms   you should know about. At the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

Apple’s iPad event was an AI teaser for its future,9/5/2024 9:22,Daniel Howley·Technology Editor9 May 2024 at 2:22 am·3-min read,"Apple’s (AAPL) artificial intelligence push has begun. On Tuesday, the company unveiled its latest iPad Pros, which pack an all-new M4 processor. The chip provides the Pro with a number of benefits including a faster CPU and updated graphics processing unit. But it was Apple’s focus on the M4’s AI capabilities that stood out the most. Apple has been putting its neural engine into processors since 2017 and has previously talked up how it helps power a number of iPhone, iPad, and Mac features for some time. But the M4 unveiling was different, serving as an appetizer for the AI features the company will present at its WWDC event in June, when Apple is widely expected to debut a slew of generative AI-powered software features for its various devices. Apple pointed to a number of the M4’s AI bona fides during the keynote, with vice president of platform architecture Tim Millet specifically noting that the chip is capable of 34 trillion operations per second, a measurement commonly used when describing a chip’s AI performance. Millet also said that the M4’s neural engine is more powerful than any neural processing unit in any AI PC. That’s a direct shot at Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), and Qualcomm (QCOM), which are preparing to or are already rolling out their own AI PC chips designed to run large language models on Windows laptops and desktops. Outside of the M4’s AI processing fundamentals, Apple was mum on any substantive discussion of AI software updates. Sure, Millet said that the M4 helps the iPad Pro quickly isolate a subject from its background in a 4K video, but the M2-equipped iPad Air can do the same thing, just a bit slower. All the company had to offer was that the M4 would make AI apps and features run faster and more smoothly. The company also didn’t provide information about the M4’s performance while training or running large language models (LLMs), something that Intel, Qualcomm, and AMD regularly point to as indicators of their chips’ strengths. Still, the fact that Apple gave consumers, and Wall Street, an early look at its AI thinking is important. The company is widely viewed as behind the curve when it comes to the generative AI race, and investors are banking heavily on WWDC serving as Apple’s big AI coming-out party. CEO Tim Cook has been steadily mentioning AI more over the past few months and said during the company’s most recent earnings call that the iPhone maker is investing heavily in the technology.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/apples-ipad-event-was-an-ai-teaser-for-its-future-184058075.html,META

Undercover operation nets arrests as New Mexico's top prosecutor blames Meta for online predators,8/5/2024 22:06,SUSAN MONTOYA BRYAN8 May 2024 at 3:06 pm·2-min read,"ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — New Mexico’s top prosecutor announced charges Wednesday against three men who are accused of using Meta’s social media platforms to target and solicit sex with underage children. The arrests are the result of a monthslong undercover operation in which the suspects connected with decoy accounts that were set up by the state Department of Justice. The investigation began in December around the time the state filed a civil lawsuit against the social media giant, claiming Meta was failing to take basic precautionary measures to ensure children were safe on its platforms. New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez said during a news conference Wednesday that the suspects communicated and exchanged explicit sexual content through Facebook's messenger app and were clear in expressing a sexual interest in children. “It’s extraordinarily concerning to us just how easily these individuals found the undercover personas that were created,” Torrez said. “And it is, frankly, I think a wakeup call for all of us to understand just how serious these kinds of threats are.” He placed blame on Meta executives, including CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and suggested that the company was putting profits above the interests of parents and children. “For those of us who are engaged in this work, we are simply tired of the rhetoric,” he said. “We are tired of the assurances that have been given to members of our communities, to members of Congress, to policymakers that all reasonable steps have been taken to ensure that this type of behavior doesn’t occur.” Meta disputed the allegations and reiterated Wednesday that it uses technology to prevent suspicious adults from finding or interacting with children and teens on its apps and that it works with law enforcement in investigating and prosecuting offenders. The company also said it has hired child safety experts, reports content to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and shares information and tools with others to help root out predators. “This is an ongoing fight, where determined criminals evolve their tactics across platforms to try and evade protections,” Meta said in an emailed statement.

Inquiry into child sexual abuse on Meta platforms leads to arrest of three men,8/5/2024 20:03,Katie McQue8 May 2024 at 1:03 pm·3-min read,"Three men have been arrested and charged with sexually preying on children via Meta’s social networks in New Mexico, the state’s attorney general announced Wednesday. The arrests stemmed from an investigation into the potential harm to children caused by Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, codenamed “Operation MetaPhile”. Undercover agents posed as children, whom the three men solicited for sex, according to the criminal complaint. The sting operation is part of an ongoing lawsuit launched by Raúl Torrez’s office in December that alleges Meta has allowed its social media platforms to become marketplaces for child predators. “This operation was focused on one specific point, that is the danger presented by Meta, and its social media platforms don’t just exist in the virtual world. They actually endanger children in the real world,” Torrez said at a press conference.  On 7 May, Marlon Kellywood, 29, was arrested outside a motel in Gallop, New Mexico, and charged with child solicitation by electronic communication device and attempted criminal penetration of a minor. Earlier the same day, Fernando Clyde, 52, was arrested and charged with the same crimes. “This is Mark Zuckerberg’s fault; this is the fault of executives of a company that has extraordinary resources at its disposal and has chosen time and time again to place profits over the interests of children,” said Torrez. Meta was approached for comment.

The third man, Christopher Reynolds, 47, is a registered sex offender and was brought into custody several weeks ago, Torrez said. Undercover investigators turned their focus to him after concerned parents reported he was targeting their 11-year-old daughter. He has been charged with child solicitation. “They expressed quite clearly a sexual interest in children,” Torrez said. “These are individuals who explicitly used this platform to find and target children.” The agents posing as children did not initiate conversations about sexual contact, per Torrez. Instead, they were all located and contacted by the three men charged, he said, who were able to find children through the design features on Facebook and Instagram.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/inquiry-child-sexual-abuse-meta-200347635.html,META

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Tejal Engman, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Tejal Engman: Good afternoon, and welcome to DoubleVerify's first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. With us today are Mark Zagorski, CEO, and Nicola Allais, CFO. Today’s press release and this call may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to inherent risks, uncertainties, and changes, and reflect our current expectations and information currently available to us, and our actual results could differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors in our recent SEC filings, including our Form 10-Q and our annual report or Form 10-K. In addition, our discussion today will include references to certain supplemental non-GAAP financial measures and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, our GAAP results. Reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in today’s earnings press release, which is available on our investor relations website at ir.doubleverify.com. Also, during the call today, we'll be referring to the slide deck posted on our website. With that, I'll turn it over to Mark. Mark Zagorski: Thanks, Tejal, and thank you all for joining us today. I am excited to discuss our solid first-quarter performance and to share the substantial product and business development progress we’ve achieved so far this year, setting a robust foundation for our future growth and success. From scaling our independently accredited core verification solutions across leading Social and CTV environments to increasing customer adoption of our key performance solutions, Scibids and Authentic Attention, DV is excelling across multiple growth vectors. And in the process, we are evolving our core value proposition to include protection and performance of media spend, solidifying our market leadership, and driving sustained business growth. In the first quarter, we exceeded the top end of our guidance ranges on revenue and adjusted EBITDA, achieving solid revenue growth, profitability, and cash flow. We grew first quarter revenue by 15% year-over-year to $141 million with double-digit revenue growth across both activation and measurement. We delivered $38 million of adjusted EBITDA, representing a 27% margin, and grew net cash from operating activities by nearly 50% year-over-year to $32 million. I’d like to begin my comments today by highlighting an evolving trend that has become increasingly prominent in recent months; the role that digital video is playing in driving ad impression growth. More specifically, we’re seeing ad spend increase in social video and CTV, which are two of DV’s fastest growing media environments. Advertisers, particularly DV’s large brand advertisers, value these environments for their audience addressability, expansive scale across the purchase funnel, and measurable performance outcomes. We're at a pivotal point where the ongoing increase in digital video has emerged as a key catalyst for digital advertising growth. As reported by Magna Global, although global programmatic ad spend grew 10% in 2023, this growth rate would have been 5% if you excluded CTV. Similarly, the Magna data highlights that video comprised nearly 70% of social content in 2023, and the IAB expects social video to grow by 20% year-over-year, faster than any other type of media. DV is primed to capitalize on this trend in social media, where video comprised 81% of our social measurement impression volumes in Q1. Our AI-powered Universal Content Intelligence technology excels in measuring video content with unmatched efficiency and accuracy and underpins our strong growth trajectory across all video environments. Today, social media is the leading driver of DV’s impression volume and revenue growth. Our newly launched brand safety and suitability measurement capabilities on platforms like Meta, YouTube, and TikTok are accelerating this growth trajectory, particularly in international markets where our brand suitability language footprint continues to grow. We grew our social measurement revenue by 51% year-over-year in the first quarter, following 48% growth in full year 2023. Most of our social media revenue growth was driven by existing DV advertisers who increased their usage of our social measurement solutions. In addition, we increased the number of Top 100 customers leveraging our solutions across Meta, YouTube, TikTok, Pinterest, and Snap compared to last year. We're especially enthusiastic about the increase in ad spend on social media platforms, given DV's strong competitive advantage in this media environment. In contrast to the open web, social platforms have limited partnerships with verification and measurement companies. In addition, the technical integrations required by social platforms are complex and demand substantial infrastructure and expertise to handle efficiently. DV distinguishes itself by providing the most comprehensive, independently accredited solutions across social platforms while simultaneously supporting the largest scale across the entire internet, spanning both social media platforms and the open web.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/doubleverify-holdings-inc-nyse-dv-193636027.html,META
Turkey's competition board to fine Meta $37.2 million in data-sharing probe,8/5/2024 14:16,Reuters8 May 2024 at 7:16 am·1-min read,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey's competition board fined Meta Platforms 1.2 billion lira ($37.20 million) on Wednesday after concluding two separate investigations on data-sharing in its Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Threads platforms. The board launched an investigation into Meta in December over a possible violation of competition law by linking its social media platforms Threads and Instagram. The board in March imposed an interim measure on Meta meant to hinder data sharing between those two platforms. Meta said last month it would temporarily shut down Threads in Turkey to comply with the interim order. The board said on Wednesday it imposed a fine of 898 million lira for the compliance process and the investigations launched into Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, as well as an additional 336 million lira fine for a separate investigation into Threads. Users will be able to merge personal data between Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp with their own consent and will be notified about data usage, according to the board decision. Users will be able to change their settings later, if needed, using an ""accounts centre"" on the platforms, it said. In January, the board also fined Meta $160,000 per day for failing to provide sufficient documentation as part of another previous investigation. It had also imposed a daily fine of 4.8 million lira per day in March over a notification message about data-sharing. Both those penalties ended May 3. In 2022, the board also decided to fine Meta 346.72 million lira for violating competition law.

Meta seeks redemption in 2024 after botching past elections,8/5/2024 9:44,"Peter Vanham, Nicholas Gordon8 May 2024 at 2:44 am·2-min read","Good morning. With the U.S. presidential election less than six months away, and elections also happening in the EU, U.K., India, and many more countries, now is a good time for CEOs to reflect on their company’s relationship to democracy at large. One company that has done so, and seems ready for redemption, is Meta. Meta has come a long way. Eight years ago, the Trump campaign used improperly obtained Facebook data to build voter profiles for 50 million users, and Russia weaponized Facebook to undermine the integrity of the U.S. elections. The scandals led to Facebook’s darkest hour, and forced its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, to testify before Congress. But 2024 isn’t 2016. A crucial part of Meta’s response since then has been the creation of an “independent” oversight board. And last week, that group released its key lessons in a historic election year. These are my takeaways: - A company should think about its principles vis-à-vis democracy and not react only to specific instances. Meta learned this lesson when it blocked former President Donald Trump’s Facebook account after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, which was seen as arbitrary. When it reinstated Trump’s account in 2023, Meta did so based on more broadly applicable protocols. - Almost no company can be entirely apolitical. Some of the most divisive societal issues concern foundational democratic principles—freedom of speech, equality, limits on government interference—written up in constitutions and human rights charters. A company must know where it stands on such values. - Efforts to interfere with elections often start small or in inexpensive markets. They then move to more expensive markets. Some interference campaigns are subtle, using deep fakes or somewhat credible fake claims. A company must study its weakest points of entry to ensure it’s not a vehicle for such schemes. - Finally, oversight boards are a good idea for almost any organization. Meta’s self-governing board can be critical of the company, and its supervision ensures Meta is caught off-guard less often by user protest or complaints. Meta didn’t get it 100% right. One shortcoming of its oversight board is that it still depends on Meta for funding. Over time, that’s bound to lead to problems. But Meta’s approach nevertheless benefits the company—and society—in myriad ways. For Meta, it lowers the likelihood of future PR crises. More broadly, it makes Meta act as a more responsible corporate citizen. That’s in everyone’s interest, and a model to follow.

12 Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy Now According to Wall Street Analysts,7/5/2024 23:40,Ramish Cheema7 May 2024 at 4:40 pm·10-min read,"In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 best artificial intelligence stocks to buy now according to Wall Street analysts. If you want to skip our coverage of the latest developments in the artificial intelligence scene, then you can skip ahead to 5 Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy Now According to Wall Street Analysts.  As companies are reporting their financial results for the first quarter of 2024, artificial intelligence once again appears to be one of the leitmotifs of the current earnings season. While the data for the current earnings season is unavailable, FactSet estimated that out of 179 companies that had earnings calls between December 15 and March 15, the term AI was mentioned on average 13 times. The tally of 179 marked the second highest for the term ""AI"" in the transcripts over the course of the past ten years, and was just three shy of the current record of 181 set during Q2 2023. Within that dataset, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) led the pack, as it mentioned the term AI 114 times during the company’s latest earnings call. The chip maker, known for its GPUs, has seen a significant boost in its stock price on the back of strong demand for semiconductors that power various AI applications. Its shares are up by a cool 216% since May 2023, after CEO Jensen Huang shared that he foresaw a the need for a ""trillion dollars of installed global data center infrastructure"" to transform computing from ""general purpose to accelerated."" Since then, NVIDIA's CEO, who is widely credited by the industry to have lead the development of GPU-accelerated computing applications such as medical imaging, reiterated his estimates of the AI industry. The latest on this front came in February 2024, when at the World Government Summit, Huang not only elaborated on his vision for accelerated computing but went on to stress that continued advancement of processors to fuel AI use cases will be energy efficient as well. According to him: ""So now, we're in the beginning of this new era. And what's going to happen is, there's about a trillion dollars worth of installed base of data centers around the world. And over the course four, five years, we'll have two trillion dollars worth of data centers that will be . .uh. . powering software around the world. And this architecture for accelerated computing is ideal for this next generation of software called generative AI. So that's really at the core of what is happening. While we're replacing the installed base, of, general purpose computing, remember that the performance of the architecture is going to be improving at the same time. So, you can't assume, just that you will buy more computers; you have to also assume that the computers are going to become faster. And, therefore, the total amount that you need is not going to be as much. Otherwise the mathematics that we just assumed, that computers never get any faster, you might come to the conclusion, we need fourteen different planets, and three different galaxies, and you know, four more Suns, to, to fuel all this. But obviously, computer architecture continues to advance."" All this focus on NVIDIA and AI means that its upcoming earnings release will be closely watched by investors and analysts worldwide. Another firm that once again has become the center of attention after quarter earnings is the Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp parent Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). Meta's stock had a strong run in February 2024 on the back of its fourth-quarter earnings report, which was accompanied by a surprise $0.5 quarterly dividend announcement. However, in April nearly all of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s gains were wiped out as investors looked past better-than-expected results and focused on the forward guidance that included Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s plans to spend $40 billion this year, most of which will go towards its AI initiatives. On the other hand, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) have managed to keep investor pessimism at bay, at least for now. Both companies reported their earnings a day after Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). Investors were pleased to see both Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) report robust growth in the Core segments, where artificial intelligence served as a major catalyst. Microsoft and Google's parent reported revenue and earnings above expectations and expressed optimism regarding maintaining the same momentum going forward. For Microsoft and Alphabet, the earnings from their cloud business divisions provide a glimpse into the firms' AI performance in the first quarter. Microsoft's overall results saw it beat analyst revenue and EPS estimates of $60.8 billion and $2.82, respectively, by posting revenue of $61.9 billion and earnings of $2.94 per share. Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment's sales sat at $26.7 billion, while Azure, the cloud computing platform, grew by 31%. At the earnings call, CFO Amy Wood also briefly commented on AI revenue growth by sharing that ""AI services contributed 7 points of growth as expected."" Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s first quarter earnings also highlighted AI due to strong performance by the Google Cloud segment. The company's Cloud business, which offers AI product bundles like Google One, posted $9.57 billion in revenue and marked a 28% growth on the year. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai shared details for Google Cloud's AI Hypercomputer, as he outlined that ""60% of funded Gen AI startups and nearly 90% of Gen AI unicorns are Google Cloud customers."" The executive added that business and corporate interest in AI was proceeding smoothly, with firms such as Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS) ""deploying Gen AI-driven tools to its nearly 10,000 call center agents to achieve faster resolution times for customers.""",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/12-best-artificial-intelligence-stocks-234048862.html,META
The challenges facing TikTok as it confronts the US in court,7/5/2024 20:56,Alexis Keenan·Reporter7 May 2024 at 1:56 pm·6-min read,"TikTok made good on its promise to challenge a new law signed by President Joe Biden that could result in a ban of the video app in the US. The company, a subsidiary of Chinese tech giant ByteDance, asked Tuesday for an injunction to block the US government from enforcing the law, calling it ""unconstitutional"" on First Amendment and other grounds. The new suit from TikTok alleges that the US law compromises the company's right to protected speech. It also claims the law infringes on the speech rights of its users. But the social media giant could find that it is on less-than-solid legal ground, some experts said. The main reason: Its ownership by a Chinese company, ByteDance. ""As a general matter, foreign companies don't have constitutional rights,"" said Jamil Jaffer, director of the Antonin Scalia Law School at George Mason University’s National Security Institute. Yet Wilson Freeman, an attorney for Pacific Legal Foundation, said his initial reaction to TikTok's complaint was that it's a challenge the government must take ""very seriously."" ""I’m not surprised they led with the First Amendment claim, as it seems like the strongest of the four claims by far,"" Freeman said. ""You can never predict with litigation, but I would not be at all surprised for TikTok to win on that claim."" One potential problem with TikTok's First Amendment strategy is that a court could shoot down the idea that content on the platform qualifies as TikTok’s or ByteDance’s own speech. If a court did validate a First Amendment claim, the company would then have to get over yet another hurdle: proving the new law is intended to influence the viewpoints expressed by TikTok — and not its stated purpose of protecting national security and user privacy.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/the-challenges-facing-tiktok-as-it-confronts-the-us-in-court-205645987.html,META
Meta to expand AI image generation offerings for ads,7/5/2024 20:01,Reuters7 May 2024 at 1:01 pm·2-min read,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, said on Tuesday it was expanding its suite of generative AI ads products to offer tools that can automatically create variations of images and overlay text atop them. The tool will launch in test form without the watermarks the social media company is applying to all images generated by its user-facing Meta AI assistant, which it has touted as a key safety feature, executives said at a press conference. John Hegeman, Meta's head of monetization, said the company was still working through how labeling would work for ads and would share guidelines by the time the tool rolls out globally, likely around the end of this year. The announcement comes as Meta is pumping billions of dollars into building and supporting its generative AI models, while trying to convince advertisers they can get more bang for their buck by automating the work involved in creative aspects of their campaigns. Fellow digital ads giant Google announced a similar expansion of AI ads tools in February. Google said ads created using its tools would be labeled using the SynthID watermarking technology developed by its AI research lab, DeepMind. With Meta's image generation tool, advertisers will be able to upload images of its products and generate other versions of those images, for example by adjusting the products' orientation or showing people using them in different settings. It is also expanding its text-generation offerings for headlines and key selling points, while adding the capability to overlay text onto generated images directly. The company will add an option in the coming months for advertisers to input text prompts that can be used to tailor the image variations, it said. As with earlier generative AI tools, advertisers running campaigns in regulated industries like politics will be barred from using the products. Advertisers have rushed to embrace AI ads tools that automate the placement of their campaigns in front of different groups of users, but generally have been more hesitant about newer generative AI tools.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-expand-ai-image-generation-200134848.html,META
Facebook supreme court to investigate ‘from the river to the sea’ posts,7/5/2024 14:43,Matthew Field7 May 2024 at 7:43 am·3-min read,"Facebook’s “supreme court” is investigating the social media giant for allowing users to post the controversial pro-Palestinian slogan “from the river to the sea”. The company’s Oversight Board, a panel of academics and campaigners who review moderation policies, said it would consider three posts where parent company Meta left the phrase online after appeals from users. Hate speech campaigners have condemned chants of “from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” as anti-Semitic and genocidal, arguing the words imply the destruction of the state of Israel and are used as a rallying cry by terror groups including Hamas. As I said earlier this week, “decolonization”, “from the river to the sea” and similar euphemisms necessarily imply genocide.Clear calls for extreme violence are against our terms of service and will result in suspension. https://t.co/1fCFo5Lezb — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 17, 2023 The board – whose members include ex-Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger and Helle Thorning-Schmidt, the former prime minister of Denmark – will look at three posts that were viewed millions of times between them. All three posts were reported by multiple users and allowed to remain online by Meta. One post condemned “senseless slaughter” by “Zionist Israeli occupiers”. The panel said it had picked the cases to determine how Meta should moderate the phrase “given the resurgence in its use after October 7, 2023, and the controversies surrounding the phrase’s meaning”. The board’s decisions are non-binding. Meta told the board that the specific posts were not found to have violated its rules against violence, hate speech or support for dangerous groups. The company said use of the slogan had already been reviewed, and that it was not necessarily a call for violence or linked exclusively to support for Hamas.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-supreme-court-investigate-river-144327060.html,META
Pinterest CEO says the platform uses AI to generate positivity,6/5/2024 21:32,Yasmin Khorram·Senior Reporter6 May 2024 at 2:32 pm·2-min read,"Pinterest is standing out from the crowd by using AI to create positive experiences for users, says its CEO. “We’re trying to prove that you can use AI for good,” CEO Bill Ready said to Yahoo Finance at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills on Monday. “We've really invested in making Pinterest a more positive alternative to traditional social media,"" he added. ""And when you ask Gen Z, they will tell you that they see Pinterest as an oasis away from the toxicity that they see on much of the rest of social media.” The social media company has been incorporating a suite of ""inclusive AI"" technologies into its platform that help make search results more representative of different body types and skin tones. Though the potential TikTok ban has been making headlines, Ready said, “We're not sitting back hoping for the demise of other platforms.” Pinterest was founded in 2008 as a visual discovery platform where users can search and save ideas. Over the years, the company has evolved into offering users shoppable content. “Pinterest is where Gen Z goes to shop,” said Ready about the platform's largest demographic. “Over the last two years, we've really been opening the stores, making it really easy for users to connect to the things that they find on Pinterest.” Pinterest reported massive first quarter earnings last week, beating analyst estimates on almost every metric.

25 States with the Highest and Lowest Resignation Rates,6/5/2024 17:24,Afifa Mushtaque6 May 2024 at 10:24 am·9-min read,"In this article, we will look at the 25 states with the highest and lowest resignation rates. We have also discussed the state of jobs in the US. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 10 States with the Highest and Lowest Resignation Rates. The state of US jobs in recent times has been nothing less than a paradox as the headline job numbers seem to be strong but Americans are struggling to secure jobs. Despite the addition of 275,000 jobs in February 2024 alone, the labor market has become increasingly competitive, with companies exercising caution in hiring given the economic uncertainty. The hiring slowdown can be attributed to various factors, including companies being wary of high interest rates and wages, leading to a more selective hiring process. As a result, the job market has become more challenging for both recent graduates and seasoned professionals alike. Speaking of hiring, see industries hiring rightnow in 2024. It is also true that the current job market is plagued by a mismatch between job openings and the skills and qualifications of job seekers. Despite there being 8.9 million job openings in January, down from a peak of 12 million in March 2022, many positions remain unfilled, while workers struggle to secure employment that matches their qualifications. It is also worth noting that in Monster's “New Year, New Career” 2024 report, 95% of surveyed US workers expressed intent to seek new job opportunities. Despite the widespread desire for change, Monster's findings reveal a cautious sentiment among workers as 68% individuals believe that it will be challenging to secure new employment due to economic conditions. Moreover, employers are faced with mounting pressure to address employee concerns, as indicated by Deloitte's Q4 2023 CFO Survey, which highlights the growing importance of competitive compensation and transparent communication to retain talent. With 45% of workers citing the need for higher income and 64% anticipating salary adjustments to counter inflation, businesses are urged to adapt their strategies to navigate evolving workforce dynamics effectively. It must be noted that in 2024, leisure and hospitality is the industry with the highest resignation rate in the US. On the other hand, information is one of the industries with the lowest turnover rates. Apart from the resignation rates, there are also concerns about layoffs. For example, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM)’s recent decision to reduce its workforce in marketing and communications has sparked concern, with reports indicating a major impact on staffing levels. In a brief meeting led by International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM)’s Chief Communications Officer Jonathan Adashek, employees were informed of the impending job cuts, adding to the uncertainty surrounding the company's future direction. Throughout the tech industry, job cuts have become increasingly common, with over 200 companies announcing layoffs, affecting nearly 50,000 positions so far this year. International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM)’s restructuring efforts align with its strategy to adapt to evolving market demands, particularly in the domain of artificial intelligence. Despite recent growth, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) continues to face challenges in monetizing its AI offerings, facing stiff competition from industry giants like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). On the other hand, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) has adopted a strategy of prudent hiring. In 2023, the company reduced its headcount by 22%, down to 67,317, as part of cost-cutting measures amid challenges in the digital ad market. Despite this reduction, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)’s performance has been impressive, with fourth-quarter sales growing by 25% to $40.1 billion, and net income increased by 201% to $14 billion.

Zuckerberg’s wealth recently reached its peak at $177 billion, before plummeting by $22 billion following Meta’s earnings report on April 25. The decline was attributed to an 11% drop in Meta stock price. Zuckerberg's current net worth is $155.2 billion.

‘News on Facebook is dead’: memes replace Australian media posts as Meta turns off the tap,5/5/2024 15:00,Nick Evershed and Josh Taylor5 May 2024 at 8:00 am·5-min read,"Meta has refused to enter into new deals with Australian media publishers for the use of their content on Facebook, leading to fears it may again implement a ban on news content appearing on the platform. But an analysis of Facebook data suggests engagement with posts from news organisations is already at an all-time low, as memes fill the space. Meta has argued that news makes up just 3% of what people engage with on its services. Related: ‘Anti-democratic’: Labor minister warns Facebook against removal of Australian news content An analysis by Guardian Australia has determined that this appears to be by design, with Meta turning off the tap for news in the past few years. A study originally carried out in 2021 by researchers from the University of Technology Sydney and RMIT looked at the amount of engagement with Facebook posts by Australian news organisations over time. It showed a decline in engagement between 2015 and November 2020, as well as a decline in traffic from Facebook to news websites. Guardian Australia has updated this analysis, which shows that engagement with posts from Australian media is now at an all-time low, with the exception of the brief period in February 2021 when Facebook blocked news posts in Australia. This drop in engagement and traffic was due at least in part to changes Meta made to its algorithms, which resulted in less news being shown in the home feed of Facebook users. But the UTS and RMIT analysis also shows some publishers changed their approaches to social media in response, focusing on different sources of traffic, such as Google search. James Meese, one of the RMIT researchers in the 2021 study, says the updated research shows that news on Facebook has continued to underperform on the platform since 2017. “Another way to say underperformance is just to say that news on Facebook is dead,” he says.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/news-facebook-dead-memes-replace-150012466.html,META
"Meta Platforms Insiders Sell US$15m Of Stock, Possibly Signalling Caution",5/5/2024 14:01,editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St)5 May 2024 at 7:01 am·3-min read,"The fact that multiple Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more. While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.  Check out our latest analysis for Meta Platforms  The Chief Technology Officer, Andrew Bosworth, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$3.8m worth of shares at a price of US$473 each. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$452. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern. Meta Platforms insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below! I will like Meta Platforms better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying. Over the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Meta Platforms. In total, Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth sold US$3.8m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain. Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Meta Platforms insiders own 14% of the company, currently worth about US$157b based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders. An insider sold Meta Platforms shares recently, but they didn't buy any. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. On the plus side, Meta Platforms makes money, and is growing profits. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Meta Platforms. To assist with this, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of Meta Platforms.

‘It’s just not hitting like it used to’: TikTok was in its flop era before it got banned,5/5/2024 12:00,Kari Paul5 May 2024 at 5:00 am·10-min read,"TikTok is facing its most credible existential threat yet. Last week, the US Congress passed a bill that bans the short-form video app if it does not sell to an American company by this time next year. But as a former avid user whose time on the app has dropped sharply in recent months, I am left wondering – will I even be using the app a year from now? Like many Americans of my demographic (aging millennial), I first started using TikTok regularly when the Covid-19 pandemic began and lockdowns gave many of us more time than we knew how to fill. As 2020 wore on, the global news climate becoming somehow progressively worse with each passing day, what began as a casual distraction became a kind of mental health lifeline. My average total screen time exploded from four hours a day to upwards of 10 – much of which were spent scrolling my “For You” page, the main feed of algorithmically recommended videos within TikTok. Related: ByteDance would shut down TikTok in US rather than sell it, sources say At the time, content was predictable, mostly light and mind-numbing. From “Get Ready With Me” (GRWM) narratives to kitten videos and the classic TikTok viral dances, I could dive into the algorithmic oblivion anytime I wanted. I loved TikTok. The “For You” page taught me actually useful skills like sign language, crocheting and how to cook when you hate cooking (I do). It also filled my days with extremely dumb distractions like the rise (and subsequent criticisms) of a tradwife family and the politicized implosion of several influencers in 2022 over cheating allegations. I enjoy watching urban exploration videos in which people inexplicably hop down into sewers and investigate abandoned houses to see what they can find. Over the course of many months, I watched a man build an underground aquarium and fill it with live eels. I treasured every wet moment. Once I learned a dumb TikTok dance – Doja Cat’s Say So, which went mega-viral during the pandemic. I probably could still do it if pressed, but don’t look for it on my TikTok profile – I came to my senses and deleted it. I don’t post often, but I did genuinely enjoy the trend of “romanticizing your life” – setting mundane video clips to inspirational music. I was inspired to share my own attempts. As TikTok faces a potential ban in the US, was the app already on its way out? But now, according to my iPhone’s Screen Time tool, my average time on TikTok ranges from 30 minutes to two hours a day – a far cry from the four-plus hours I was spending at the peak of the pandemic. My withdrawal from TikTok was not a conscious choice – it happened naturally, the same way my addiction began. As my partner put it during a recent nightly scroll before bed: “It’s just not hitting like it used to.” I still find some joy on the app. The delight is just less abundant than it was. Something has changed on TikTok. It’s become less serendipitous than before, though I don’t know when. Others seem to agree, from aggrieved fellow journalists to content creators on the platform and countless social media threads – which raises the question: as TikTok faces a potential ban in the US, was the app already on its way out?",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/just-not-hitting-used-tiktok-120010931.html,META
The ending of Google's monopoly trial has Silicon Valley on edge,5/5/2024 11:38,Alexis Keenan·Reporter5 May 2024 at 4:38 am·5-min read,"Google has a lot at stake as a federal judge weighs whether the tech giant’s search empire should be broken up. So does the rest of Silicon Valley. A landmark antitrust case pitting Google (GOOG, GOOGL) against the Justice Department entered its final stage this past week as prosecutors from the federal government and 14 states said in their closing arguments that Google illegally monopolized the online search and search advertising markets. Google's lawyer, John Schmidtlein, pushed back one more time with a claim the company has made from the beginning: ""Google is winning because it’s better,"" he said. A government win would certainly threaten a giant piece of Google’s $237.8 billion profit engine. But the outcome, which will be decided by US District Judge Amit Mehta in the weeks or months to come, also has giant implications for some of the other big names in the tech world. That's because Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) are defending themselves against a series of other federal- and state-led antitrust suits, some of which make similar claims, and because all three stand to lose or gain depending on the outcome. In Apple’s case, US attorneys have alleged the iPhone maker blocked rivals from entering the smartphone market by using a “web of contractual restrictions.” A similar claim was made by the government in Google's case, which hinges on several types of contracts that Google allegedly used to cement its search dominance. ""The broad lessons here are a long way off, but this is clearly a really important time when the very first of these tech cases is going to be decided,"" said University of Washington antitrust professor Douglas Ross. ""I do think they're going to be interested in how narrowly or broadly [the judge] defines the markets here,"" Ross added, ""and if there is any learning in what he writes that might have application elsewhere.""",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/the-ending-of-googles-monopoly-trial-has-silicon-valley-on-edge-113835464.html,META
"Democratic officials criticize Meta ad policy, saying it amplifies lies about 2020 election",3/5/2024 19:29,CHRISTINA A. CASSIDY3 May 2024 at 12:29 pm·3-min read,"ATLANTA (AP) — Several Democrats serving as their state's top election officials have sent a letter to the parent company of Facebook, asking it to stop allowing ads that claim the 2020 presidential election was stolen. In the letter addressed to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, the secretaries of state from Colorado, Maine, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington and Vermont said allowing such ads will further erode trust in elections and fuel threats of political violence against election workers, which already has led some to leave the profession. Also signing the letter was Wisconsin Secretary of State Sarah Godlewski, who does not oversee elections. “Meta is allowing extremists and election deniers to further undermine our elections,” the secretaries wrote in the letter, which was emailed to the tech giant on Thursday. “As Secretaries of State, we are strongly opposed to Meta’s decision to allow ads promoting election denialism and urge you to repeal this policy before it inflicts more damage.” Nearly four years later, conspiracy theories surrounding the 2020 election and false claims of widespread fraud and manipulation of voting machines persist. Former President Donald Trump continues to insist, despite no evidence of widespread fraud, that he won that election as he seeks a return to the White House. Reviews, recounts and audits in the swing states where he disputed his loss have all affirmed Democrat Joe Biden's victory, and even Trump's former attorney general said there was no fraud on a scale that could have tipped the election. In an interview this week with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Trump falsely claimed he won Wisconsin despite losing to Biden by about 21,000 votes. Trump told the news outlet he would accept the results of the November election “if everything’s honest.” Since the 2020 election, election workers across parts of the country have faced death threats and harassment. A recent survey by the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU found that 34% of local election officials said they knew of one or more local election officials or election workers who left their job at least in part because of safety fears, threats or intimidation. The environment has led to a historic turnover of election workers throughout the country. YouTube, the Google-owned video service, announced a policy similar to Meta's last year in which it said it would stop removing content that falsely claimed previous U.S. presidential elections were tainted by fraud. Meta has defended the work it's doing to protect elections globally. A company spokesperson provided details about how the company views elections, referencing its 2022 plan for the midterm elections in which the company said it will “continually review content to determine if it violates our community standards, including our policies on election and voter interference, hate speech, coordinating harm and publicizing crime, and bullying and harassment.” As part of its work, Meta said it would remove election-related content that includes misinformation about the “dates, locations, times and methods of voting” along with calls for violence related to voting or the outcome of an election. In that plan, the company specified it would reject ads calling into question the legitimacy of an upcoming or ongoing election. But it's the ads related to the 2020 election that have the group of Democratic secretaries of state concerned, including various campaign ads earlier this year repeating false claims that the election was rigged. The letter was organized by the Democratic Association of Secretaries of State, a political action committee affiliated with the Democratic National Committee, and was circulated only among Democrats.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/democratic-officials-criticize-meta-ad-192935239.html,META
Smaller social platforms are adding TikTok-like features as TikTok’s future hangs in the balance,3/5/2024 16:54,Alexandra Sternlicht3 May 2024 at 9:54 am·5-min read,"LTK is not TikTok. The creator-focused shopping platform has just 40 million monthly active users, versus the 1 billion who watch video clips posted on TikTok. TikTok generates about $16 billion in annual revenue whereas LTK makes “hundreds of millions,” according to a company spokesperson. The fact is that most people have never even heard of LTK. But after President Joe Biden last month signed legislation forcing a TikTok sale or ban, LTK and a handful of other smaller social platforms may be able to take advantage and throttle their growth. “There are opportunities and there are friction points,” says LTK president Amber Venz Box about a potential TikTok ban. As it is, LTK is morphing into a more TikTok-like platform by the day. LTK is now emphasizing video, allowing creators to post more in-depth content about the products they’re hawking such as one very TikTok-ish clip about the differences between polyurethane leather stilettos and actual leather ones. The videos can be up to 10 minutes long and feature links to buy the products shown. In recent weeks, social gaming company Roblox has also introduced features that mimic TikTok that push it deeper into shopping, user videos, and creators. It premiered a tool from developer Neura Studios for users to create and edit videos, and a hub for posting TikTok-style clips that feature Roblox avatars (rather than actual humans). Roblox also doubled down on its e-commerce arm with a new Walmart partnership to sell the retailer’s products in Roblox’s metaverse. This could entice Roblox’s 71.5 million daily active users, most of them young, to shop more, potentially also attracting some of TikTok’s users and creators. Meanwhile, Amazon-owned Twitch, the live-streaming service popular with gamers, in October started letting users post short disappearing videos, or Stories, like Instagram, Facebook, and Snapchat and TikTok have long offered. It also just launched a scrollable video feed that looks a lot like TikTok’s For You page—showing users videos that they wouldn't otherwise find. LTK, Roblox, and Twitch probably would have released their new TikTok-like features regardless of the looming TikTok ban, to be imposed if TikTok’s China-based owner fails to sell the service to a non-China-based buyer. After all, tech companies copy rivals all the time. But the fact that the new products coincide with TikTok’s current turmoil could give them a bigger boost than they would have otherwise got. TikTok has vowed to fight its possible ban in court. However, there are some potential downsides to a TikTok-free future in the U.S. along with the benefits, says LTK’s Venz Box. TikTok users often discover creators on TikTok and then later follow them onto LTK. Without that unofficial funnel, Venz Box worries that traffic to LTK may tumble. It’s difficult to know for sure. In the end, some analysts, including Jasmine Enberg from eMarketer, suspect Alphabet’s YouTube and Meta’s Facebook and Instagram (with emphasis on the Meta properties) stand to benefit the most from a TikTok ban. They could both ultimately strengthen their social media duopoly and put even more pressure on the competition. As it is, both companies already have billions of users and huge ad revenue that have helped propel their parent companies to $1 trillion-plus market caps. And their deep pockets have allowed them to afford workforces equivalent to the populations of small cities. But killing off one of social media’s titans wouldn’t exactly be a good thing for consumers, says Anupam Chander, a Georgetown University law professor who specializes in the global regulation of new technologies.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/smaller-social-platforms-adding-tiktok-165433610.html,META
Tech platforms make pitch for ad deals as TikTok is roiled by politics,3/5/2024 16:43,Sheila Dang3 May 2024 at 9:43 am·3-min read,"By Sheila Dang (Reuters) - Short-form video took center stage at tech and social media companies' annual presentations to advertisers, as platforms like Snap and Meta look to capitalize on TikTok's political uncertainty in the U.S. to take ad dollars from their rival. The presentations in New York, known as the NewFronts, come just a week after U.S. President Joe Biden signed a bill that gives Chinese tech company ByteDance up to one year to divest TikTok, or else the app will be banned over national security concerns. TikTok has vowed to fight the legislation. The short video platform announced new sports and entertainment partnerships at its NewFront on Thursday evening, including an agreement that broadcaster NBCUniversal will post clips of this summer's Paris Olympics on TikTok. TikTok is expected to generate $8.66 billion in U.S. ad revenue this year according to an estimate from research firm Emarketer. While it is a fraction of the size of Google and Meta, TikTok kicked off the short-form video craze and prompted rivals to build similar features. ""TikTok must show advertisers that it's business-as-normal, even though it's anything but,"" Emarketer principal analyst Jasmine Enberg said. On Wednesday, Snap, which owns photo messaging app Snapchat, said it would also partner with NBCUniversal to send popular influencers to the games to film content. It will also host clips of top concerts from events promoter Live Nation. ""We're having very productive conversations about how Snapchat can help, because there is a lot of noise at the moment,"" said Patrick Harris, Snap's president of Americas and partnerships. ""But we have our heads down and we're making sure we're a dependable and viable platform."" The focus on professionally produced videos is designed to attract brands wary of the downside of social media or artificial intelligence (AI) generated content.

Mehta said a central issue was platform “substitute-ability” for advertisers, which the court must resolve. He will now begin preparing to render a major decision on whether Google's conduct broke civil antitrust law. He did not indicate when he would rule, but experts say he could potentially order changes to Google's business practices. Mehta also questioned whether Google assesses competitors’ pricing before making its own adjustments. Google's advertising business is responsible for about three quarters of its revenue. U.S. government lawyer David Dahlquist argued that “advertising revenue is what drives Google’s monopoly power today.” Google has boasted it feels no real market pressures, Dahlquist said, arguing that the company does not fear increasing its pricing or not improving its products. “Only a monopolist can make a product worse and still make more money,” Dahlquist argued.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/1-google-us-clash-over-154826329.html,META

Companies have largely surprised to the upside, with the index pacing at earnings growth of 5.5% this quarter, per Evercore ISI. Stock reactions have been mixed, though, as the prospect of interest rates remaining high for longer than expected hangs over markets and many companies struggle to impress investors given the market's roaring rally going into the reporting period.  Below we break down some of the key companies that have reported this season. Tesla (TSLA) stock rose more than 10% on the day following its earnings report despite the company missing Wall Street's expectations for both revenue and earnings per share in the prior quarter. Instead of a fundamentals story, CEO Elon Musk caught investor attention with an announcement that the company would accelerate its launch of a low-cost vehicle. Musk also emphasized the company's role in the AI world, highlighting that the company will be a leader in autonomous ridesharing.  Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) stock soared more than 10% after the company announced its first-ever cash dividend of $0.20 per share. The board of directors also approved stock repurchases of up to an additional $70 billion. The company's market cap surpassed $2 trillion following the report. The Facebook parent company had a different earnings reaction than its tech counterparts. The stock fell more than 10% after the midpoint of its current quarter revenue guidance range came in light compared to the Street's expectations. Spending was also a key concern among investors, as Meta (META) said it expects the company's full-year total expenses to come in between $96 billion and $99 billion, up from a range of $94 billion to $99 billion due to higher infrastructure and legal costs.

The business — which Amazon CEO Andy Jassy hired Selipsky to run in 2021 — saw operating profits nearly double to $9.4 billion. The division represented about 62% of Amazon's Q1 operating profits. Selipsky contends that with 85% of companies still storing their data on-premise, the tailwinds for AWS are just beginning to gust. ""We're optimistic about the business outlook for AWS and I think it can continue to grow really rapidly. I don't really see an upper limit on it,"" Selipsky says.

Apple CEO Tim Cook boasts of future AI plans after earnings beat,2/5/2024 21:47,Daniel Howley·Technology Editor2 May 2024 at 2:47 pm·2-min read,"Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook took time during the company's second quarter earnings call on Thursday to drum up excitement for the iPhone maker's upcoming generative AI offerings. In his remarks, Cook told listeners that the company is bullish about the opportunities generative AI has to offer and that it is making significant investments in the technology. ""We believe in the transformative power and promise of AI, and we believe we have advantages that will differentiate us in this new era including Apple's unique combination of seamless hardware, software, and services integration; groundbreaking Apple silicon with our industry leading neural engine; and our unwavering focus on privacy,"" Cook said. Ahead of the call, Apple reported better-than-anticipated earnings and revenue, though iPhone sales fell about 10% year over year. Apple will host its annual WWDC developer conference in June, which should serve as the launchpad for the company's generative AI ambitions. Analysts hope generative AI could kick off another iPhone sales supercycle. But, so far, the technology doesn't appear to be driving sales of competing smartphones from the likes of Samsung and Google. Cook has been relatively tightlipped regarding Apple's generative AI plans, dropping small tidbits about the company's investments here and there. This is one of the first times he's come out so strongly about how Apple will set itself apart from its Big Tech rivals in the generative AI space. Wall Street is waiting on tenterhooks for Apple's generative AI announcements. The company hasn't debuted any generative AI products since the technology exploded in popularity in late 2022. Rivals including Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft, meanwhile, have rolled out a series of generative AI capabilities and products including chatbots and search engine improvements. Microsoft, in particular, has added generative AI directly to Windows 11 via the Windows 11 Copilot. If Apple's generative AI plans are going to live up to Wall Street's expectations, it will need to enable some kind of must-have features that users can't get on their existing devices.

Mirror publisher suffers hit as Facebook downgrades news articles,2/5/2024 17:50,James Warrington2 May 2024 at 10:50 am·3-min read,"The publisher of the Mirror and Express newspapers has posted a drop in revenues after a change in Facebook’s algorithm downgraded the importance of news. Reach reported an 8.5pc fall in digital revenues in the first three months of the year as boss Jim Mullen suffered a shareholder backlash over his pay. Unlike publications with a subscription-based business model such as The Telegraph, Reach relies on advertising income, meaning changes in traffic from social media can greatly affect its revenues. Facebook, which is owned by Meta, has begun downgrading news articles on its platform, while it is winding down deals to pay publishers and has shut down its news tab entirely. X, formerly Twitter, has also taken steps to deprioritise news, including removing headlines from articles, as boss Elon Musk tries to keep users on the website. Reach, which relies heavily on social media for referrals, said the changes meant its page views had slumped by a third year-on-year. The publisher has previously branded Facebook a “potent threat to civil society”. The publisher, which also owns regional titles including the Liverpool Echo and Manchester Evening News, is battling to turn around its fortunes as it struggles to adapt to the digital era.

25 Most Profitable Companies in the US,2/5/2024 16:20,Ramish Cheema2 May 2024 at 9:20 am·9-min read,"In this piece, we will take a look at the 25 most profitable companies in the US. If you want to skip our overview of the US economy and the current business climate, you can jump ahead to the 5 Most Profitable Companies in the US.  With the second quarter of 2024 with us, Wall Street is focused on determining whether companies that are investing in AI are actually bringing in money or whether they are investing costly capital to set themselves up for future growth. Firms that belong to the former sector, i.e. those that are making money from AI, have been rewarded as has been the case with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). Just like NVIDIA is Wall Street's favorite AI stock when it comes to semiconductors needed to power up large data processing software, Microsoft is the king of the jungle when it comes to AI software. In the latter segment, the best example is Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) whose shares have dropped after the latest earnings report revealed that 2024 will require an additional $40 billion in capital to fund AI growth. This sharp eye on AI comes when investors are grappling with an economy that might be starting to slow down just as the Federal Reserve finds it difficult to tamp down on inflation. While the AI gold rush of 2023 put inflation and other macroeconomic indicators on the backdrop, after the inflation data for March 2024, they are back in the spotlight. This environment, which has left investors eager to flee away from stocks once again comes as profitability becomes key, particularly as profits are important to enable firms to position themselves for growth (such as is the case with AI stocks) or keep investors happy by paying out dividends. US companies are also some of the biggest in the world when it comes to profits. America's corporate sector, particularly the technology industry, is the most developed in the world. Firms such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) are able to compete with the world's largest state owned enterprises when it comes to revenue. In fact, Apple is the first company in the world that has proven that technology and personal computing is a more lucrative industry than oil - a commodity that is responsible for powering daily lives. To understand how, consider that Apple's trailing twelve month revenue as of December 2023 sits at a whopping $385 billion. Now, compare this with the net sales of the Saudi state owned oil giant Saudi Arabian Oil Company (TADAWUL:2222.SR), which has raked in SAR2 trillion during the same time period. Using an exchange rate of 3.75 SAR to a dollar leads to approximately $530 billion in revenue for the Saudi oil giant. While naturally, Aramco's revenue is higher since it does not have any comparable competitors on a global level, the fact that a consumer technology firm that is dependent not only on the need to stay abreast with innovation but also with what its rivals are doing is able to earn more than half of the revenue is something in itself to say the least. As a whole, Insider Monkey also looked at the 30 Largest Companies in the World by Revenue. This shows that US companies reign supreme even though Aramco enjoys free access to the vast global crude oil market. The US retail giant Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) tops this list courtesy of its $648 billion in sales, showing that a well run privately owned company has the full potential to take on massive state owned giants. But what about profits? After all, even if a firm makes hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue, its investors get nothing if money does not flow through the income statement and into retained earnings. Today, we'll look at some of the most profitable companies in America, with a couple of top picks being Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).

How To Earn $500 A Month From Meta Platforms Stock Following Upbeat Q1 Earnings,2/5/2024 14:52,Avi Kapoor2 May 2024 at 7:52 am·2-min read,"Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) posted better-than-expected earnings and sales results for its first quarter on April 24. The company reported roughly 3.24 billion Family Daily Active People in the first quarter. That’s up 7% year-over-year. The company said capital spending is likely to increase in future years as its artificial intelligence roadmap is supported. The European Commission reportedly plans to investigate Meta's Facebook and Instagram over concerns regarding Russia disinformation, with suspicions of inadequate moderation. Some Meta investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends. As of now, Meta has a dividend yield of 0.46%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 50 cents a share ($2.00 a year). To figure out how to earn $500 monthly from Meta, we start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months). Next, we take this amount and divide it by Meta's $2.00 dividend: $6,000 / $2.00  = 3,000 shares So, an investor would need to own approximately $1,317,570 worth of Meta Platforms, or 3,000 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500. Assuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $2.00 = 600 shares, or $263,514 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100.

Daily Mirror owner Reach sees another hit from social media news de-ranking,2/5/2024 9:53,"Holly Williams, PA Business Editor2 May 2024 at 2:53 am·2-min read","Daily Mirror publisher Reach has revealed a further hit to online revenues due to the ongoing fallout from moves by the likes of Facebook to de-rank news on its platforms. The group – which also owns the Express newspapers, the Daily Star and regional newspapers across the UK – revealed that page views plunged by a third year-on-year in the first quarter after “major platforms” de-prioritised news last year. Overall, digital revenues fell 8.5% in the first three months of 2024, although this was better than the 14.2% fall seen in the previous quarter. Firms such as Facebook owner Meta moved last year to prioritise user-generated content above news on their social media sites, which has hit traditional media groups hard. But Reach said the impact was partially offset in the first quarter by strengthening yield per page, while it said the year-on-year fall in so-called referral traffic from social media platforms will also “lessen as we progress through the year”. The group’s update showed overall group revenues fell 6.7%, with print revenues down by 6%. It said sales from newspaper circulation was proving a “predictable and reliable revenue stream”, with turnover down by a more muted 3.4% after it hiked cover prices. Advertising revenues for its print titles remained under pressure, down 10.7% in the quarter. But the group stuck by its guidance for underlying full-year earnings of £97.6 million, up from £96.5 million in 2023. Shares in the group lifted 9% in Thursday morning trading.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/daily-mirror-owner-reach-sees-095317926.html,META
"AI investments are showing signs of a payoff, but the price is steep",2/5/2024 9:13,Daniel Howley·Technology Editor2 May 2024 at 2:13 am·4-min read,"Tech earnings season is in full swing, and while a handful of notable players still need to report, namely Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA), there’s one key throughline running through the announcements so far: It’s taking a lot of money to make money on AI. Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT), four of tech’s biggest AI players, have each called out AI sales growth, though without many specifics, while pointing to increased spending on capital expenditures to meet AI demand. Microsoft announced last week it spent $14 billion on capital expenditures tied to its AI buildout in its fiscal third quarter, up from $7.8 billion in the same period last year. The company’s 2024 capital expenditures have already eclipsed its spending across all of 2023, and there’s still another quarter left in its fiscal year. Google parent Alphabet said it spent $12 billion in the last quarter and will continue at that pace for the rest of the year. Meta similarly said it’s cranking up spending for the full year from $30 billion-$37 billion to $35 billion-$40 billion. And CFO Susan Li said that number will increase in the year ahead as well. And on Tuesday, Amazon said it would blow past last year’s $48.4 billion in capital expenditures, saying the $14 billion it spent in Q1 will be the low for the year. Those are mountains of cash. And while there are early signs that AI is driving revenue growth, it’ll take time before it truly makes an impact on companies’ bottom lines. “I'm thinking it's a 12- to 18-month investment period before we start to see a lot of this really pay off big time,” TECHnalysis founder and chief analyst Bob O’Donnell told Yahoo Finance. Generative AI is still a relatively new technology. Sure, it blew up in 2023, but corporations are slow-moving entities, and many are only starting to try out generative AI applications across their business segments. “If I sign up for Microsoft 365 with Microsoft, do I sign up all of my 100,000 employees or do I sign up 500 to check it out?” O’Donnell asked, adding that companies are starting out with a smaller number of signups to get a sense of how they can best use AI applications on the job before signing up the rest of their employees. That’s not necessarily a bad thing for tech companies. During its earnings call last week, Microsoft said AI accounted for 7 percentage points of revenue growth in its Azure and other cloud services business. That was up from 6 percentage points in the prior quarter and 3 percentage points in the quarter before that. In Q4 last year, the company said AI drove 1 percentage point of growth in Azure.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-investments-are-showing-signs-of-a-payoff-but-the-price-is-steep-181413381.html,META

Top 20 Tech Companies in Silicon Valley,1/5/2024 14:36,Ramish Cheema1 May 2024 at 7:36 am·9-min read,"In this piece, we will take a look at the top 20 technology companies in Silicon Valley. If you want to skip our coverage of the world's technology hub and a region that has changed the world as we know it, then check out 5 Top Tech Companies in Silicon Valley.  If there's one thing that 2024 has made sure it's that Silicon Valley isn't going anywhere. The sector that gave us the microprocessor, the personal computer, the Internet, and the smartphone is now leading the charge with a set of technologies called artificial intelligence. Typically the domain of science fiction, AI is a collection of techniques that fall under the category of data science. It is the most advanced kind of data science there is, as the software is programmed to learn from voluminous data sets to generate and create insights of its own. The close of the first quarter of 2024 also provided Wall Street the ability to take stock of where some of the biggest technology companies in the world, most of which are in Silicon Valley, are when it comes to artificial intelligence. Big ticket technology and AI companies, such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) report their earnings for the first quarter of 2024. These results primarily focused on the costs that the companies had incurred for their AI platforms in Q1 and also their plans for further spending this year. One of the first firms to report its earnings was the Facebook parent Meta. Its shares tanked by 16% in aftermarket hours on the day of the earnings report, as Wall Street digested a multi billion dollar AI capital expenditure plan for 2024 and saw costs grow for the first time after two consecutive quarters. Alphabet sought to assure investors of its stability, as it became yet another technology stock to declare a dividend. An additional source of income is almost always welcomed by investors, and Alphabet's shares soared by more than 10% in aftermarket, even as its peer Microsoft demonstrated mixed share price performance despite being one of the strongest performers on the artificial intelligence front. Delving deeper into Silicon Valley giant Alphabet's earnings, the firm known for being Google's parent, announced a 20 cent dividend and a $70 billion stock buyback. Both of these are great for helping the share price, and since its earnings report, Alphabet's stock is by 6% after shedding some of its 10% gains in post earnings gains during regular trading hours. On the revenue front, Alphabet brought in $80 billion while it raked in $1.81 on the EPS front. Both of these beat analyst estimates that had stood at $78.59 billion and $1.59, and coupled with $61.7 billion in advertising revenue that surged past estimates of $60.2 billion meant that the latest set of results was rather well rounded. On the hardware side of things, Intel, which is one of the biggest semiconductor manufacturers in the world, is currently focusing on the leading edge side of the industry. The firm has lost its chip manufacturing race to the Taiwanese Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), and in April 2024, it announced the 'first light' for the world's most advanced chip making machine, a high NA EUV scanner. First light refers to the first time that a chip making machine is turned on, and the event typically marks the end of countless hours of work spent in setting up the complex machines. As for AI, here's what the management of Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), another Silicon Valley firm, had to say during its Q1 2024 earnings: We’re bringing generative AI to Adobe Experience Cloud and will demonstrate our AI Assistant for Customer Experience Management at Adobe Summit. Every student, communicator, creative professional and marketer is now focused on leveraging generative AI to imagine, ideate, create and deliver content and applications across a plethora of channels. Adobe is uniquely positioned through the combination of Express, Firefly, Creative Cloud, Acrobat and Experience Cloud to deliver on this immense market opportunity. The success we are already seeing with our GenStudio offering in the enterprise is validation of our leadership, and we expect that success to translate into other segments as we roll out these solutions throughout the year. We are driving strong usage, value and demand for our AI solutions across all customer segments. With these details in mind, let's take a look at some top technology companies in Silicon Valley. A couple of notable names are Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).

"Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) sheds 13% this week, as yearly returns fall more in line with earnings growth",1/5/2024 11:00,editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St)1 May 2024 at 4:00 am·2-min read,"Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) shareholders might be concerned after seeing the share price drop 13% in the last week. But in stark contrast, the returns over the last half decade have impressed. In fact, the share price is 127% higher today. To some, the recent pullback wouldn't be surprising after such a fast rise. Of course, that doesn't necessarily mean it's cheap now. Since the long term performance has been good but there's been a recent pullback of 13%, let's check if the fundamentals match the share price.  See our latest analysis for Meta Platforms  While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS). Over half a decade, Meta Platforms managed to grow its earnings per share at 22% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 18% over the same period. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days. The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers). We know that Meta Platforms has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained. It's good to see that Meta Platforms has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 80% in the last twelve months. And that does include the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 18% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Meta Platforms that you should be aware of before investing here.

"Apple’s promised AI plan is ‘all that matters’, analysts say, as it tries to play catch up with Big Tech rivals",1/5/2024 10:30,Rachyl Jones1 May 2024 at 3:30 am·5-min read,"In the year and a half since OpenAI introduced the game-changing large language model ChatGPT, investors have pressured all the Big Tech companies to prove they can keep up. Most tech giants have responded by announcing a series of AI-related initiatives—to a mixed reception on Wall Street. Last week, Microsoft gained $54 billion in value on the strong performance of its cloud business, which is growing quickly partly thanks to the AI-frenzy of its business customers. In contrast, Facebook-parent Meta has gone on a spending spree to build data centers and buy servers to prepare for an AI-centric world, causing its shares to tank and shaving more than $130 billion from its market value. But there’s one company—Apple—that has left investors impatiently waiting for details about its AI efforts. And all signs point to the company making them wait a little longer as it prepares to announce its fiscal second quarter earnings on Thursday. Apple has yet to unveil any AI initiatives on par with the ambition of its rivals—such as Meta’s open-sourced large language model, Microsoft’s workplace assistant, Google’s integration of AI into its search, and Amazon’s service to build customized large language models for businesses based on existing ones. During recent earnings calls, Apple’s executives have repeatedly dodged questions on the matter, with CEO Tim Cook saying during the company’s most recent earnings call in February that he prefers “not to get out in front of ourselves.” During the call, Cook hinted at a big AI-related announcement later this year. But shareholders shouldn’t get their hopes up this week about any new, significant AI products. Analysts from at least five investment banks and research firms don’t expect any big news until Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in June, according to their research notes. And the actual roll out of any new products to customers may not come until months later in the fall, according to equity research company CFRA. “All that matters this year is clarity on Generative AI initiatives,” CFRA analysts wrote, adding that it expects Apple’s June conference to be its most important event in years. Apple “has historically been slow to adapt to changes, but times have changed, and management needs to realize that the company needs to react quicker in a world that is being disrupted by GenAI.” The lack of an AI plan has factored into Apple’s poor stock performance this year. So far, its shares are down 8% since the beginning of January, trading Tuesday at $170 per share, versus the Nasdaq, which is up 5% over the same time period. Analysts have made a variety of predictions about what Apple’s expected big announcements may be. Many predict that some of the news will be focused on iPhone 16, which is expected to debut in September. Goldman Sachs envisions a version of the digital assistant Siri that uses a large language model to better understand what’s happening on a device screen to answer prompts more effectively than it does now, analysts said in an April 12 report. Other potential AI features include predictive text for iMessage, photo and video editing tools, AI-generated playlists for Apple Music that align more specifically to individual users’ tastes, and a tool that summarizes audio recordings and that is different from the one that already transcribes voicemails, according to Goldman Sachs. An AI-powered iPhone 16 could be exactly what Apple needs to shake up its phone business after months of sales declines due to decreasing demand in China, investment firm Wedbush Securities said in a research note on Tuesday. As competition between U.S. and Chinese tech companies heats up—particularly around the microchips necessary for AI—Chinese consumers have turned away from the iPhone and towards domestic alternatives.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-promised-ai-plan-matters-103000974.html,META

Judge dismisses Meta shareholder lawsuit claiming that directors' obligations extend beyond company,30/4/2024 22:58,RANDALL CHASE30 April 2024 at 3:58 pm·2-min read,"DOVER, Del. (AP) — A Delaware judge on Tuesday dismissed a shareholder lawsuit asserting novel claims about the roles of corporate leaders and arguing that the loyalties of Meta directors and company founder Mark Zuckerberg should not lie exclusively with the social media giant. James McRitchie, who runs a website focused on corporate governance and shareholder activism, argued that Meta’s directors have breached their duties to the company by putting profits over broader societal and economic interests, including Meta shareholders’ diversified investments in other companies. In a 101-page opinion citing court rulings dating back more than 200 years, decades of law review articles and legal treatises, and even a Sherlock Holmes short story, Vice Chancellor J. Travis Laster rejected McRitchie’s claims. Laster noted that, under the “standard Delaware formulation” of corporate law, directors of a corporation owe duties to the stockholders as investors in that corporation. “The plaintiff has not made a persuasive case for change,” Laster wrote. “At most, he has shown that some academics — primarily from the law and economics school — have assumed that a diversified-investor model is the norm. He has also shown that some investor advocacy organizations would prefer that model.” While Delaware law requires corporate directors to act in the best interests of their stockholders, including maximizing the value of their shares, attorneys for McRitchie argued that Delaware courts should recognize a “portfolio theory” of corporate governance that takes into account external factors. They argued, for example, that Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, has prioritized profits while downplaying the detrimental effects of its products on society and the global economy. That, in turn, they said, can negatively affect the investment portfolios of Meta shareholders who also have invested in other companies. Among the “negative externalities” the lawsuit blamed on Meta’s social media platforms are mental health problems among young Instagram users, online human trafficking, “vaccine hesitancy,” incitements to violence, and “election misinformation.” Asian countries are known for their long working hours and stressful work cultures.

Reports by The Information on Tuesday (April 30) say he’s fired two top executives, and plans to get rid of hundreds more workers. Musk is said to be frustrated by falling sales, and the pace of earlier job cuts. The story quotes an email said to be from Musk. In it he says, “these actions are making it clear that we need to be absolutely hard core about headcount”. In an apparent warning to managers, he says “while some on exec staff are taking this seriously, most are not yet doing so”. There was no immediate response to a Reuters request for comment. It all follows a move earlier this month to shed some 10% of the company’s workforce. Tesla is grappling with falling sales and an intensifying price war which it started. Reporting earnings last week, it said all that led to its first quarterly drop in revenue since 2020. Musk this weekend made a surprise visit to China, the epicenter of the price battle.

Snap Finally Advances On The Ad Front,30/4/2024 18:34,Upwallstreet30 April 2024 at 11:34 am·3-min read,"Last Thursday, Snap Inc (NYSE: SNAP) reported its first quarter financials, showing that the improvements it made to its advertising system showed results faster than anticipated. Upon the earnings beat, strong revenue growth as well as the rise of daily active users to 422 million, shares surged 21% during after-hours trading. First quarter results show Snap’s efforts to rebuild its ad business are working. For the first three months of the year, Snapchat-parent reported revenue rose 21% to $1.19 billion, surpassing LSEG’s estimate of $1.12 billion. More importantly, Snap finally reported double digit sales growth, after six consecutive quarters of single-digit growth and declines. Advertising brought in $1.11 billion to the revenue table, while Other Revenue grew 194% YoY to $87 million, fueled by more than 9 million Snapchat+ subscribers. As a result, adjusted EBITDA of $46 million surpassed expectations as StreetAccount expected a loss of $68 million. Adjusted EPS amounted to 3 cents, also greatly surpassing LSEG’s estimate of a 5 cents loss. Net loss narrowed to $305.1 million or 19 cent loss per share. Second quarter guidance also surpassed estimates For the current quarter, Snap guided for revenue in the between $1.23 billion and $1.26 billion, while StreetAccount expected $1.22 billion. Its adjusted EBITDA outlook is between $15 million and $45 million, also greatly surpassing Wall Street’s average expectation of $15.5 million. Social media companies are benefiting from a stabilizing economy. Last week, Facebook-parent, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), surpassed both top and bottom line analyst estimates with its latest earnings report. However, Meta shares plunged due to a weak revenue guidance. For its first quarter, Meta reported its revenue rose 27% to $28.65 billion, which is its fastest growth rate since 2021, with net income more than doubling to $12.37 billion as besides the revenue acceleration, it did a great job in lowering sales and marketing costs by 16% YoY. Ad business, that makes most of Meta’s revenue, rose as much as 27% to $35.64 billion.However, Meta also increased its capital expenditures forecast due to ramping up AI investments. It guided for the 2024 capital expenditures in the range between $35 billion and $40 billion. Although Meta still hasn’t delivered its metaverse promise, its track record when it comes to social media and ads is as strong as it gets. Although Snap is still far behind Meta, both in terms of size and growth, they are facing similar challenges and after all, Snap is targeting a narrower niche of younger social media users. At the end of the day, Snap showed its business is improving faster than expected, providing hope that the Snapchat parent is finally on the right track to monetize its value proposition.

"Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",30/4/2024 13:00,Zacks Equity Research30 April 2024 at 6:00 am·5-min read,"Meta Platforms (META) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock. Shares of this social media company have returned -12% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -2.5% change. The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which Meta Platforms belongs, has lost 8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term? While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making. Revisions to Earnings Estimates Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock. Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements. Meta Platforms is expected to post earnings of $4.68 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +44.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.2%. The consensus earnings estimate of $20.17 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +35.6%. This estimate has changed +1.2% over the last 30 days. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.26 indicates a change of +15.3% from what Meta Platforms is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.7%. Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Meta Platforms is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-platforms-inc-meta-attracting-130015547.html,META
RPT-Amazon.com may be feeling pressure to join the dividend club,30/4/2024 11:53,Lewis Krauskopf30 April 2024 at 4:53 am·3-min read,"(Repeats to additional subscribers, no change to content of story) By Lewis Krauskopf NEW YORK, April 30 (Reuters) - E-commerce titan Amazon.com may be under increasing pressure to offer investors a dividend, as it now finds itself one of the few massive U.S. technology and growth companies not making regular payouts to shareholders. Google parent Alphabet last week became the latest of the so-called Magnificent Seven group of market heavyweights to start paying a dividend, after Meta Platforms declared one in February. The announcements were followed by big post-earnings gains in the shares of both companies, though they were far from the only factor. That has left Amazon and Tesla as the only companies in the group that do not pay a dividend. Microsoft's payouts date back some 20 years, while Apple and Nvidia have been paying dividends for over a decade. Amazon will report quarterly results and hold a conference call with analysts after the market closes on Tuesday, in the midst an earnings season that has produced mixed reactions to results by Big Tech companies. “It certainly puts the spotlight on (Amazon) because now they’re really the last one standing in terms of Big Tech not paying a dividend,” said Nicholas Colas, cofounder of DataTrek Research. “Dividends are representations of earnings power. So the fact that the rest of Big Tech has now decided to be able to exhibit earnings power and growth in earnings power with a dividend, that leaves them very much isolated versus the rest of the group,” Colas said. David Katz, chief investment officer of Matrix Asset Advisors, said the dividend decisions by Amazon's peer group could have some influence. ""They could reasonably say, 'OK, the bigger players like Google, like Meta, have instated a dividend, we can do that as well,'"" said Katz, whose firm owns shares of both Alphabet and Amazon.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/rpt-amazon-com-may-feeling-115339619.html,META

Meta under fire from European Union for not doing enough about election disinformation,30/4/2024 15:15,KELVIN CHANUpdated 30 April 2024 at 8:15 am·3-min read,"LONDON (AP) — The European Union said Tuesday that it's investigating Facebook and Instagram for suspected violations of the bloc's digital rulebook, including not doing enough to protect users from foreign disinformation ahead of EU-wide elections. The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, said it's opening formal proceedings into whether parent company Meta Platforms breached the Digital Services Act, a sweeping set of regulations designed to protect internet users and clean up social media platforms under threat of hefty fines worth up to 6% of annual revenue. European authorities are scrambling to safeguard elections amid official warnings that Russia is seeking to meddle with the vote in June, when citizens of the bloc's 27 nations pick lawmakers for the European Parliament. The investigation includes an urgent request for Meta to provide information about its move to discontinue a key tool for monitoring elections. “We have a well established process for identifying and mitigating risks on our platforms,"" Meta said in a statement. ""We look forward to continuing our cooperation with the European Commission and providing them with further details of this work.” Meta is being scrutinized “for suspected breach of DSA obligations to protect integrity of elections,"" European Commissioner Thierry Breton said in a social media post. The Commission said it's looking into whether Meta is doing enough to curb the spread of “deceptive advertisements, disinformation campaigns and coordinated inauthentic behaviour” that could pose a risk to “electoral processes” and consumer protection. Officials said they suspected Meta's content moderation system for advertisements was inadequate, allowing ads made with generative AI including deepfakes to exploited by malicious foreign actors seeking to meddle in elections even as the company makes money from them. Experts worry that new generative AI systems could be used to disrupt the many elections being held around the world this year, by supercharging the ability to spread disinformation at scale. The EU also suspects that Facebook and Instagram might be reducing the visibility in recommendation feeds of political content from accounts that pump out a lot of it - a practice known as shadowbanning - and not being transparent about it with users, which would violate the DSA.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-instagram-face-european-union-111336846.html,META

Amazon.com may be feeling pressure to join the dividend club,30/4/2024 10:00,Lewis Krauskopf30 April 2024 at 3:00 am·3-min read,"By Lewis Krauskopf NEW YORK, April 30 (Reuters) - E-commerce titan Amazon.com may be under increasing pressure to offer investors a dividend, as it now finds itself one of the few massive U.S. technology and growth companies not making regular payouts to shareholders. Google parent Alphabet last week became the latest of the so-called Magnificent Seven group of market heavyweights to start paying a dividend, after Meta Platforms declared one in February. The announcements were followed by big post-earnings gains in the shares of both companies, though they were far from the only factor. That has left Amazon and Tesla as the only companies in the group that do not pay a dividend. Microsoft's payouts date back some 20 years, while Apple and Nvidia have been paying dividends for over a decade. Amazon will report quarterly results and hold a conference call with analysts after the market closes on Tuesday, in the midst an earnings season that has produced mixed reactions to results by Big Tech companies. “It certainly puts the spotlight on (Amazon) because now they’re really the last one standing in terms of Big Tech not paying a dividend,” said Nicholas Colas, cofounder of DataTrek Research. “Dividends are representations of earnings power. So the fact that the rest of Big Tech has now decided to be able to exhibit earnings power and growth in earnings power with a dividend, that leaves them very much isolated versus the rest of the group,” Colas said. David Katz, chief investment officer of Matrix Asset Advisors, said the dividend decisions by Amazon's peer group could have some influence. ""They could reasonably say, 'OK, the bigger players like Google, like Meta, have instated a dividend, we can do that as well,'"" said Katz, whose firm owns shares of both Alphabet and Amazon. While corporate profits are ultimately seen as a far more important driver of a company’s share price, dividends could increase a stock’s shareholder base - though they may take time to do so.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-com-may-feeling-pressure-100000755.html,META
EU investigates Meta over fears of election interference and foreign disinformation,29/4/2024 19:24,"Brian Fung, CNN29 April 2024 at 12:24 pm·2-min read","European Union officials are investigating Meta over concerns the company hasn’t done enough to protect upcoming EU elections or to combat foreign disinformation on its platforms, setting up the possibility of steep fines or other penalties. The new probe is focused on Meta’s handling of advertising by scammers and foreign election meddlers, said an EU source familiar with the investigation; the source was granted anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. The probe focuses as well on a decision to shut down an analysis tool widely used by researchers and journalists to monitor Meta’s platforms. A driving factor in the investigation is a concern about Meta’s ability to respond to Russian disinformation campaigns that could undermine election integrity, the source added. The investigation is the latest example of European regulators flexing their muscle against US tech giants following the passage of a flurry of new laws designed to rein them in. The EU source said the investigation highlights apparent violations of Europe’s signature law governing online platforms, the Digital Services Act. If confirmed, the violations could lead to significant fines of up to 6% of Meta’s global revenue. As part of the probe, the EU source said they are also looking into whether decisions by Meta to rank political content lower in users’ feeds may violate the DSA’s transparency rules. They added that Meta’s tools for users to report illegal content don’t appear to align with the DSA’s requirements, either. The investigation comes after Meta submitted required materials to the European Commission last fall outlining how it manages perceived risks linked to its products. This investigation, however, reflects EU skepticism that Meta has successfully managed those risks. A key aspect of the investigation targets Meta’s decision to sunset CrowdTangle, a once-popular tool used by civil society groups to track trending conversations on Facebook and Instagram. Without it, the EU source said, users and researchers will have less visibility into what is happening on Meta services and could have a harder time detecting foreign election interference. Meta said earlier this year that CrowdTangle will no longer be available after August 14.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/eu-investigates-meta-over-fears-144158604.html,META
Tesla surges by $64bn after Elon Musk’s Beijing breakthrough,29/4/2024 17:24,Christopher Jasper29 April 2024 at 10:24 am·34-min read,"Tesla added nearly $64bn (£51bn) to its valuation after the EV giant took a step closer to launching self-driving cars in China. The world’s largest electric vehicle maker jumped 12pc as trading began on Wall Street after it reached a data-sharing agreement with Chinese tech giant Baidu. The tie-up, revealed during Elon Musk’s surprise visit to Beijing, will allow Tesla to use Baidu’s mapping and navigating systems on Chinese roads. Sources told Reuters that the agreement will allow Tesla to roll out its “full self-driving” features in China, as the partnership will remove regulatory hurdles. By signing the agreement with Baidu, Tesla will use one of 20 approved local suppliers of mapping and navigation systems in China, according to the Financial Times. It will also help overcome Chinese laws forbidding domestic data from being transferred out of the country. Removing this barrier was seen as a vital step for Tesla as it was being outflanked by Chinese rivals such as XPeng and Huawei Technologies, both of which have rolled out their own competitor software. The jump in Tesla’s share price comes after the company has lost almost a third of its valuation over the past year, fuelled by concerns over its growth potential. Read the latest updates below.

It has done this by creating pages that mimic real news organisations, while also paying for sponsored posts to publish propaganda relating to Russia’s war in Ukraine. Meta has previously said it has blocked thousands of pages believed to be linked to the disinformation group.

Outperformance by Microsoft and Alphabet, along with Elon Musk's automaker turn AI play Tesla (TSLA), pushed the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq (^IXIC) to their best weekly performance this year. “They're delivering on earnings,” HSBC’s Nicole Inui told Yahoo Finance. “This is a secular growth story, and we think the sector continues to stay strong over the second half of the year.” Results from Microsoft and Google gave Wall Street an early glimpse at how AI will drive stocks for years to come. Microsoft said AI services accounted for 7 percentage points of the 31% revenue jump in its Azure cloud division. Meanwhile, increasing contributions from AI helped Google’s cloud revenue surge 28%, compared to a year ago. “The commentary from both Google and Microsoft tells us that there is real demand for AI,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Rishi Jaluria told Yahoo Finance. “It's not just hype, it's not just people talking about it. There's actual capital being put to work.” In a note to clients this week, Bank of America’s Michael Hartnett wrote that “narrow mega-cap growth leadership” will remain intact until threats of a recession materialize.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/the-ai-trade-is-back-as-confidence-in-big-tech-surges-160013297.html,META

"Meta Platforms, Inc. Beat Analyst Estimates: See What The Consensus Is Forecasting For This Year",27/4/2024 13:07,editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St)27 April 2024 at 6:07 am·3-min read,"Last week, you might have seen that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) released its quarterly result to the market. The early response was not positive, with shares down 7.9% to US$443 in the past week. Meta Platforms reported US$36b in revenue, roughly in line with analyst forecasts, although statutory earnings per share (EPS) of US$4.71 beat expectations, being 8.9% higher than what the analysts expected. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. We've gathered the most recent statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their earnings models, following these results.  See our latest analysis for Meta Platforms  Taking into account the latest results, the most recent consensus for Meta Platforms from 56 analysts is for revenues of US$158.8b in 2024. If met, it would imply a meaningful 11% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to expand 11% to US$20.10. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$158.7b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$20.02 in 2024. The consensus analysts don't seem to have seen anything in these results that would have changed their view on the business, given there's been no major change to their estimates. It will come as no surprise then, to learn that the consensus price target is largely unchanged at US$523. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. There are some variant perceptions on Meta Platforms, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$600 and the most bearish at US$400 per share. Analysts definitely have varying views on the business, but the spread of estimates is not wide enough in our view to suggest that extreme outcomes could await Meta Platforms shareholders. Another way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the industry. The period to the end of 2024 brings more of the same, according to the analysts, with revenue forecast to display 15% growth on an annualised basis. That is in line with its 16% annual growth over the past five years. Compare this with the broader industry, which analyst estimates (in aggregate) suggest will see revenues grow 9.8% annually. So it's pretty clear that Meta Platforms is forecast to grow substantially faster than its industry. The most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment, with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. Happily, there were no major changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow faster than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates. Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings.

Tesla and Microsoft presented 2 distinct versions of AI.

And both sound pretty good. Microsoft (MSFT) announced a partnership with Coca-Cola (KO) in which the soft drink king would pay $1.1 billion to “jointly experiment” with Microsoft’s new Azure AI-based version of its cloud-based suite of productivity software. And when Microsoft’s quarterly results showed AI driving more and more of its cloud business growth and bullish guidance from an enthusiastic leadership team, the stock rose 2% Friday. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) had a similar story, but with a stronger investor reaction — up 10% Friday — as investors reconsidered the company’s second-place position to Microsoft. Now, it seems YouTube, search, and cloud businesses are strapped in and ready for their AI-ification. On the other side of the table was Tesla’s (TSLA) earnings presentation. The company doubled down on its endgame of fully autonomous vehicles, a robotaxi fleet, licensing self-driving tech to other automakers — they’re in conversations, Elon Musk said — and the potential of harnessing the AI computing power of parked Teslas to create something akin to Amazon’s AWS, a bold but old idea that has been floating around since the 1980s.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-and-microsoft-presented-2-distinct-versions-of-ai-investors-liked-both-120001115.html,META
"Instagram, YouTube the biggest likely winners of TikTok ban but smaller rivals could rise too",27/4/2024 21:21,BARBARA ORTUTAYUpdated 27 April 2024 at 2:21 pm·4-min read,"Adult U.S. TikTok users spend an average of 54 minutes on the app on any given day, more than Instagram, Snapchat or YouTube, according to research firm eMarketer. If TikTok were to disappear, those platforms — along with younger, smaller emerging rivals — would be scrambling for those valuable minutes of people's attention. But with an actual ban still likely years away, it's not clear what app will be its biggest beneficiary. Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, may see more advertisers amid uncertainty for its biggest rival, according to analysts who follow the company. Creators, dealing with uncertainty themselves are also expanding to other platforms if they weren’t already. But users, especially the younger ones who are TikTok’s bread and butter, are less predictable. Will they embrace Instagram, a possibly uncool mom favorite? Or could a newer app like Triller rise to viral fame? Here's a look at some notable TikTok alternatives and how they measure up. Meta has a long tradition of cloning competitive services, with varying degrees of success. The Instagram “Story” feature, which lets people share photos and videos that expire in 24 hours, is similar to Snapchat. The company also launched a TikTok knockoff called Lasso in 2018 but closed that down in 2020. Then Instagram launched Reels 2020, a TikTok-like feed of short videos users can create or scroll through. It’s proven to be massively popular. Could it replace TikTok? That depends. While many creators post on both platforms, some experts say the youngest users are unlikely to migrate to a service made popular by their millennial parents. And while Meta's algorithm is addictive, it's still not TikTok. “Replicating TikTok’s algorithm is a nearly impossible task, as rival Meta would attest to,"" said eMarketer analyst Jasmine Enberg. “TikTok’s ability to serve up relevant and entertaining content to its users is unparalleled in the social media world.” While TikTok gets more headlines, YouTube still dominates U.S. teens' attention. Roughly nine in ten teens said they use YouTube, in a recent survey by the Pew Research Center, making it the most widely used platform among the 13-17 crowd. TikTok clocked in at 63%, Snapchat at 60% and Instagram at 59%. Its parent company Google launched YouTube Shorts in 2020, shortly after India banned TikTok. YouTube users can scroll through Shorts just as they can on TikTok or Reels on Instagram and Facebook, watching hours of bite-sized videos. As with Reels, many of the videos featured are from TikTok or creators who post to several different platforms. That said, YouTube is still known for its longer-format videos, so it may not have the variety that TikTok users are looking for — at least not yet. While older adults never quite got into Snapchat, launched in 2011 with its infamous disappearing videos, it remains popular among teens and younger adults. In addition to its disappearing video feature, the company launched Snapchat Spotlight in 2020 (yes, the same year India banned TikTok and former U.S. President Donald Trump was trying to in the U.S.). The feature can be accessed by pressing the sideways triangle icon at the bottom of your screen and, at least according to Snapchat, it “shines a light on the most entertaining Snaps, no matter who created them.”",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/instagram-youtube-biggest-likely-winners-001623752.html,META
"Meta’s investors are worried about the billions it’s spending on AI—but its advertising empire makes it a positive, Deutsche Bank says",26/4/2024 19:35,Dylan Sloan26 April 2024 at 12:35 pm·3-min read,"Meta is betting the farm on AI, and it’s alarming its investors. In its earnings report Wednesday, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the tech giant was raising its estimates for capital expenditures, which includes spending on AI training and data centers, by billions of dollars—and it anticipates it will scale up even more down the line. Meta raised its spending estimates to $35-$40 billion, up from $30-$37 billion. “We expect capital expenditures will continue to increase [in 2025] as we invest aggressively to support our ambitious AI research and product development efforts,” CFO Susan Li said. Those huge spending numbers scared investors enough to send shares plunging up to 16% immediately following the release. But Deutsche Bank says shareholders are wrong to fear Meta’s huge wager on AI: its pole position in the advertising game makes it a prime contender to benefit in the long run. “As the fastest growing ad platform at scale, we argue Meta is actually leaning into Gen AI from a position of strength,” wrote the bank in a research note issued following the earnings release. “Meta is entering an investment cycle. We have been here a couple of times before, and each time it ended the same way...good for Meta's longer-term equity value.” Meta has already rolled out multiple consumer-facing AI tools, including AI-enabled smart glasses built in collaboration with Ray-Ban and its open-source Llama 3 AI model. But Deutsche Bank says that recommendation algorithms are the place AI is going to make the biggest difference for Meta. Meta’s most popular apps, including Instagram, Facebook, and Threads, are already leveraging AI to push customized content into users’ feeds—and they’re all proven profit generators. Deutsche Bank pointed out that on Facebook, an app typically associated with seeing content posted by a user’s friends, 30% of posts viewed are AI-recommended, and that number rises to 50% for Instagram. Leveraging AI in the Reels algorithm has resulted in users spending 8-10% more time on the app. Given that Meta already has the advertising game figured out for these apps, using AI recommendations to increase the amount of time users are spending on them is a clear path to more revenue. “AI-driven ranking and targeting improvements continue to boost ad efficiency, while Reels' ad load continues to converge towards that of feed and stories,” Deutsche Bank wrote. “We see Gen AI driving the next leg of growth for Meta by: 1) increasing engagement and use cases for users with products and services such as Meta AI and Agents for creators; 2) unified AI-powered recommendations across apps, which is now driving more than 50% of the content viewed on IG; [and] 3) driving automation for advertisers.” Investors might not see the results immediately, though. Zuckerberg said on the earnings call that ""we’ve historically seen a lot of volatility in our stock during this phase of our product playbook where we’re investing and scaling a new product but aren’t yet monetizing it.” Meta has already poured close to $50 billion into its metaverse initiatives, which have yet to yield any clear benefits. And Meta has signaled it’s still at the early stages of pumping money into its AI plans, meaning investors should brace for more big spending numbers in the future. “Meta is making bigger investments in AI than we anticipated, which will likely result in capital expenditures being much higher, for far longer,” Deutsche Bank wrote. In the long run, though, Deutsche Bank argues that AI’s usefulness for ads, the backbone of Facebook’s business model, positions the investment for big long-term gains.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-investors-worried-billions-spending-193534983.html,META

Intel CEO confident in its AI future after posting soft guidance,26/4/2024 18:27,Brian Sozzi·Executive Editor26 April 2024 at 11:27 am·3-min read,"After several steps forward with investors, it's a few steps back for Intel (INTC). Shares of the chipmaker fell 8% on Friday, following several hiccups in its first quarter results and second quarter guidance. While the company's first quarter earnings managed to surpass forecasts by $0.05, its guidance for the rest of the year came below consensus. ""We have a lot of great things happening in the second half of the year. We feel very comfortable with the outlook we have,"" Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said to Yahoo Finance. The selling pressure on Intel's stock stems from two areas. First, results for the quarter were constrained by a wafer supply issue that Wall Street failed to properly model. And second, there was some demand softness from customers — which is causing Intel execs to be on the cautious side for the second quarter guidance. Intel expects second quarter sales of between $12.5 billion and $13.5 billion. Analysts were anticipating $13.63 billion. Earnings are projected at $0.10 per share, short of analyst forecasts for $0.24. ""We believe Intel has a difficult road ahead as the company begins a multi-year transition phase which involves high capital intensity and an ambitious design roadmap with expectations to move through five process node transitions in four years,"" Stifel analyst Ruben Roy said in a client note. Roy maintained a Hold rating on Intel's stock.

Meta Platforms Bought Some Time With Long-Term AI Potential,26/4/2024 15:49,Upwallstreet26 April 2024 at 8:49 am·3-min read,"On Wednesday, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: META) topped Wall Street estimates with its first quarter results. But, stock plunged 16% due to a light revenue guidance that overshadowed the fact its revenue grew at a fastest quarterly rate since 2021 and net income more than doubled. Like Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), Meta didn’t talk much about AI, until now. During the earnings call, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg detailed the company’s AI roadmap, hinting at a shift from chatbots to AI agents, highlighting confidence in the company’s leadership on the AI front.           For the first three months of the year, Meta reported revenue expanded 27% YoY to $36.46 billion, surpassing LSEG’s estimate of $36.16. Net income more than doubled to $12.37 billion or $4.71 per share, surpassing LSEG’s estimate of $4.32 as the Facebook-parent successfully lowered its sales and marketing costs by 16% compared to last year’s comparable quarter. As for its userbase metric, Meta revealed there were 3.24 billion family daily active people in March, which represents a 7% YoY rise while average revenue per user in the quarter was $11.20. Digital advertising makes 98% of Meta’s revenue and it rose 27% YoY to $35.64 billion. Therefore, building leading AI has a lot to do with turning those efforts into ad dollars. With revenue of $440 million, Reality Labs unit reported a loss of $3.85 billion. Since the end of 2020, Meta’s most important division it based its new identity on lost more than $45 billion. As for the second quarter, Meta guided for revenue between $36.5 billion and $39 billion, while analysts on average expected $38.3 billion. Meta guided for capital expenditures in the range between $35 billion and $40 billion, while previously forecasting $30 billion to $37 billion. The increase is due to accelerated AI investments. Meta bought some time with long-term potential of AI. After a brutal 2022 during which Meta lost about two thirds of its value and figuring out how to live in a new privacy environment that Apple cooked up. But, Meta or more precisely, Zuckerberg, made sure that sure that smaller advertisers knew that, thanks to Apple and the privacy changes it introduced, it got more expensive to reach their potential customers. Apple and Meta feud, or more precisely, the feud of their respective CEOs has been going on since 2014, at least. But Apple is well used to attacks regarding its App Store commissions and Tim Cook often simply leaves such comments without a response. But, Meta clearly preserved its users and ad dollars, and it seems to have succeeded to restore Wall Street’s confidence with its cost cuts efforts it kicked off early last year, marking 2023 as its year of efficiency. Although AI still didn’t provide the lift that Meta needs, Zuckerberg succeeded to convince Wall Street of the company’s AI leadership potential, which will take time to be realized through the company’s financials. But, then again, Meta certainly has a strong record of monetizing its services. DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

My name is Krista and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Meta First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded. Thank you very much. Ken Dorell, Meta's Director of Investor Relations, you may begin. Kenneth Dorell: Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Meta Platform's first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Joining me today to discuss our results are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO; and Susan Li, CFO. Before we get started, I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause these results to differ materially are set forth in today's earnings press release and in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. During this call, we will present both GAAP and certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. The earnings press release and an accompanying investor presentation are available on our website at investor.fb.com. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Mark. Mark Zuckerberg: All right. Thanks, Ken, and everyone, thanks for joining. It's been a good start to the year both in terms of product momentum and business performance. We estimate that more than 3.2 billion people use at least one of our apps each day and we're seeing healthy growth in the US. And I want to call out WhatsApp specifically where the number of daily actives and message sends in the US keeps gaining momentum and I think we're on a good path there. We've also made good progress on our AI and Metaverse efforts and that's where I'm going to focus most of my comments today. So let's start with AI. We are building a number of different AI services from Meta AI, our AI assistant that you can ask any question across our apps and glasses, to creator AIs that help creators engage their communities and that fans can interact with, to business AIs that we think every business eventually on our platform will use to help customers buy things and get customer support, to internal coding and development AIs, to hardware like glasses for people to interact with AIs and a lot more. Last week, we had the major release of our new version of Meta AI that is now powered by our latest model, Llama 3 and our goal with Meta AI is to build the world's leading AI service, both in quality and usage. The initial rollout of Meta AI is going well. Tens of millions of people have already tried it. The feedback is very positive and when I first checked in with our teams, the majority of feedback we were getting was people asking us to release Meta AI for them wherever they are. So we've started launching Meta AI in some English speaking countries and we'll roll out in more languages and countries over the coming months. You all know our product development playbook by this point. We release an early version of a product to a limited audience to gather feedback and start improving it. And then once we think it's ready, then we make it available to more people. That early release was last fall and with this release, we are now moving to that next growth phase of our playbook. We believe that Meta AI with Llama 3 is now the most intelligent AI assistant that you can freely use and now that we have the superior quality product, we are making it easier for lots of people to use it within WhatsApp, Messenger, Instagram and Facebook. Now in addition to answering more complex queries, a few other notable and unique features from this release. Meta AI now creates animations from still images and now generates high quality images so fast that it can create and update them as you are typing, which is pretty awesome. I've seen a lot of people commenting about that experience online and how they've never seen or experienced anything like it before. In terms of the core AI model and intelligence that's powering Meta AI, I'm very pleased with how Llama 3 has come together so far. The 8 billion and 70 billion parameter models that we released are best-in-class for their scale. The 400 plus billion parameter model that we're still training seems on track to be industry leading on several benchmarks and I expect their models are just going to improve further from open source contributions. Overall, I view the results our teams have achieved here as another key milestone in showing that we have the talent, data and ability to scale infrastructure to build the world's leading AI models and services and this leads me to believe that we should invest significantly more over the coming years to build even more advanced models and the largest scale AI services in the world. As we're scaling CapEx and energy expenses for AI, we'll continue focusing on operating the rest of our company efficiently, but realistically, even with shifting many of our existing resources to focus on AI, we'll still grow our investment envelope meaningfully before we make much revenue from some of these new products. I think it's worth calling that out that we've historically seen a lot of volatility in our stock during this phase of our product playbook where we're investing in scaling a new product, but aren't yet monetizing it. We saw this with reels, stories as newsfeed transitioned to mobile and more and I also expect to see a multi-year investment cycle before we fully scaled Meta AI, business AIs and more into the profitable services I expect as well.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-platforms-inc-nasdaq-meta-130843596.html,META

Earnings season has continued to roll along at a rapid pace, with this week's reporting docket notably stacked. We've heard from several market heavyweights, including Meta Platforms and Netflix. Shares of each faced selling pressure post-earnings, erasing a chunk of the year-to-date gains we've seen from each stock. It raises a valid question – is the selling overdone, or is this a rich opportunity for investors? Let's take a closer look at each company's quarterly release. Netflix Concerning headline figures, Netflix posted a 17% beat relative to the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate and posted sales modestly ahead of the consensus, with both items showing considerable growth from the year-ago periods. Total subscribers were reported at 269.6 million, reflecting a 16% jump year-over-year. Still, the real surprise in the quarterly release was that the company will no longer report quarterly membership numbers starting next year in 2025 Q1, likely explaining the knee-jerk reaction post-earnings. Nonetheless, Netflix enjoyed a solid quarter, posting $2.1 billion in free cash flow and seeing its year-to-date operating margin moving higher to 28.1% (20.6% in FY23). The company also maintained its free cash flow outlook of $6 billion for FY24 and repurchased 3.6 million shares throughout the period. Earnings expectations have moved higher following the release, a bullish near-term sign. Netflix is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The company's growth outlook remains bright, with consensus expectations for its current fiscal year suggesting 50% earnings growth on 15% higher sales.

Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg invoked an earlier Facebook era, when the social network transitioned to mobile phones, to remind investors that you must first spend money to make money. Zuckerberg was right to remind investors about the concept of, well, investing because after glimpsing the sheer cost of an AI investment spree, Wall Street shoved Meta shares down an elevator shaft.

The board of directors also approved stock repurchases of up to an additional $70 billion. “Our results in the first quarter reflect strong performance from Search, YouTube and Cloud,"" said CEO Sundar Pichai in a statement on Thursday. ""Our leadership in AI research and infrastructure, and our global product footprint, position us well for the next wave of AI innovation.” The company's market cap stood at $2.15 trillion in early afternoon trading on Friday.

In artificial intelligence, Google has widely been seen as playing catch up to Microsoft (MSFT), which was among the first in the tech world to reap the cultural excitement around consumer AI chatbots. Microsoft invested in OpenAI, the company behind the popular ChatGPT. But Google executives emphasized during the earnings call Thursday that the company is well positioned to lead the shift to an AI-centric tech world, and that it is committed to investments that will fuel the development of new models. Pichai said the company has clear paths to monetize AI breakthroughs through advertising, cloud, and subscriptions. He also touted the integration of AI tools into Google search, which allows users to ask more complex and descriptive questions.

They helped offset a slide for Intel after it gave a forecast for profit that fell short of analysts’ expectations. Treasury yields eased after a report on inflation for March came in close to expectations. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below. NEW YORK (AP) — Alphabet and Microsoft are leading the U.S. stock market on Friday toward the finish of its first winning week in the last four. The S&P 500 was 1.2% higher in afternoon trading and on track for its best week since November. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 210 points, or 0.5%, as of 1:45 p.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 2.3% higher. Alphabet jumped 10.2% after breezing past analysts’ expectations for profit last quarter. The parent company of Google also said it will start paying a dividend to investors and authorized a program to buy back up to $70 billion of its stock, a signal of how much cash it's generating. Microsoft, meanwhile, climbed 2.7% after reporting stronger profit and revenue than expected. It cited strong growth in its cloud-computing business as it pushes artificial-intelligence technology to its customers. They helped offset a 9.8% drop for Intel. It reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than expected, but its revenue fell short of analysts’ estimates. So did its forecast for profit in the current quarter. Stocks have broadly been under pressure this month as hopes withered for multiple cuts to interest rates this year by the Federal Reserve. A series of reports this year showing inflation remaining worse than forecast has traders expecting maybe one cut this year, down from forecasts for six or more at the start of the year. Yet another report on Friday showed inflation remaining stubbornly high. This time it was the measure of prices for March that the Federal Reserve prefers to use, but it wasn’t much worse than forecasts. Financial markets took it much more in stride than a report from the day before that suggested the same measure of inflation rose quickly from January through March. Treasury yields eased in the bond market following Friday morning's report.

Google owner valued at $2 trillion,25/4/2024 20:56,James Titcomb25 April 2024 at 1:56 pm·2-min read,"Google’s parent company soared past a $2 trillion valuation last night as the search engine giant said it would pay a dividend for the first time. Shares in Alphabet rose by more than 12pc to a record high as the company announced the payout to shareholders, alongside a $70bn (£56bn) share buyback scheme. Microsoft shares also rose after the world’s most valuable company revealed record profits. It meant both tech giants shrugged off a tech sell-off earlier in the day triggered by fears about the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Alphabet reported revenues of $80.5bn for the first quarter of the year, a 15pc rise, and said profits had climbed by 57pc to $23.7bn. It said it would pay shareholders a quarterly dividend of 20 cents a share, amounting to a payout of more than $2.5bn, and that it planned to continue paying quarterly cash dividends in the future. It comes after Meta said it would pay its first dividend in February. Microsoft shares climbed by more than 5pc after sales jumped on growing demand for its AI technology. Quarterly revenues rose 17pc to $61.9bn while profits were up 20pc, at $21.9bn. Google has faced questions about whether it is falling behind companies such as OpenAI, the maker of the popular ChatGPT chatbot, as well as concerns that the rise of AI could threaten its lucrative search engine. Microsoft, meanwhile, has been seen as one of the biggest beneficiaries of the ChatGPT craze. It is a major investor in OpenAI and has built the chatbot into many of its own products. It overtook Apple as the world’s most valuable listed company earlier this year. But investors had questioned whether the hype and heavy spending around AI is turning into tangible revenues.

Meta & Netflix Face Post-Earnings Pressure: A Buying Opportunity?,25/4/2024 20:03,Derek Lewis25 April 2024 at 1:03 pm·3-min read,"Earnings season has continued to roll along at a rapid pace, with this week’s reporting docket notably stacked. We’ve heard from several market heavyweights, including Meta Platforms META and Netflix NFLX. Shares of each faced selling pressure post-earnings, erasing a chunk of the year-to-date gains we’ve seen from each stock. It raises a valid question – is the selling overdone, or is this a rich opportunity for investors? Let’s take a closer look at each company’s quarterly release. Netflix Concerning headline figures, Netflix posted a 17% beat relative to the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate and posted sales modestly ahead of the consensus, with both items showing considerable growth from the year-ago periods. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Total subscribers were reported at 269.6 million, reflecting a 16% jump year-over-year. Still, the real surprise in the quarterly release was that the company will no longer report quarterly membership numbers starting next year in 2025 Q1, likely explaining the knee-jerk reaction post-earnings. Nonetheless, Netflix enjoyed a solid quarter, posting $2.1 billion in free cash flow and seeing its year-to-date operating margin moving higher to 28.1% (20.6% in FY23). The company also maintained its free cash flow outlook of $6 billion for FY24 and repurchased 3.6 million shares throughout the period. Earnings expectations have moved higher following the release, a bullish near-term sign. Netflix is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Year-over-year S&P 500 earnings growth for the first quarter of 2024 is now seen at 4.3%, according to LSEG data on Thursday. That is up from 3.3% the day before. The latest estimate is based on results from 190 of the S&P 500 companies and forecasts for the rest, with about 78% of reports beating analysts' earnings expectations. LSEG noted that the forecast has been impacted heavily by an adjustment for Bristol Myers Squibb because of a $12 billion one-time charge related to its acquisition of Karuna Therapeutics. Without that one-time item, S&P 500 earnings are expected to have risen 7.4% year-over-year, based on LSEG estimates. Stocks were down on Thursday, however, despite the improved outlook for quarterly earnings. Among the biggest drags, Meta Platforms shares plunged after the Facebook-parent late Wednesday forecast higher expenses and lighter-than-expected revenue.

"Elon Musk And Mark Zuckerberg Never Fought In The Cage, But Zuckerberg Still 'Beat' Musk By Surpassing His Net Worth For First Time In Years",25/4/2024 18:31,Jeannine Mancini25 April 2024 at 11:31 am·3-min read,"While their much-hyped cage match never materialized, the rivalry between Meta Platforms Inc. CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk continues to play out in the real world — with their net worth acting as the scorecard. The executives traded barbs on social media last year, each appearing ready to face off in a physical match until Musk reported needing surgery, putting an end to the planned event.  Zuckerberg landed a metaphorical jab at Musk by surpassing him on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index for the first time since 2020. On April 5, Bloomberg reported that Zuckerberg became the third-richest person in the world, with a net worth of $186 billion, surpassing Musk, who was fourth on the list with a net worth of $180 billion. The shift is largely the result of the impressive performance of Meta's stock, which has surged about 40% since the start of the year, adding roughly $49 billion to Zuckerberg's wealth. Conversely, Musk has seen his fortune diminish as Tesla’s shares have dropped by 43%, eroding $76 billion from his wealth and marking Tesla as the worst performer in the S&P 500 this year.

Musk reclaimed the third spot with Zuckerberg’s net worth dropping to $175 billion. This back-and-forth is likely to continue. The setback in Tesla’s stock followed its first year-over-year sales decline since the pandemic and price cuts on several vehicles and its Full Self-Driving software. Despite these challenges, Musk is still attempting to secure a controversial $45 billion pay package, initially valued at $56 billion, that could potentially restore his position above Zuckerberg if approved by shareholders. The rivalry between Zuckerberg and Musk has been ongoing. In 2016, a SpaceX rocket explosion destroyed a Facebook satellite aimed at providing internet to sub-Saharan Africa, prompting Zuckerberg to express his deep disappointment.

"Meta’s Zuckerberg can't calm Wall Street’s nerves on AI spending, stock falls 10%",25/4/2024 18:01,Daniel Howley·Technology Editor25 April 2024 at 11:01 am·4-min read,"Meta stock (META) fell more than 10% on Thursday after CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed that the social media company is pouring more cash into its AI efforts, spooking investors. The CEO, however, tried to assuage investor concerns about the company’s spending during Wednesday’s earnings call, noting that Meta has made similar moves when transitioning to other new technologies in the past. “We've historically seen a lot of volatility in our stock during this phase of our product playbook, where we're investing in scaling a new product but aren't yet monetizing it. We saw this with Reels, Stories, as Newsfeed transitioned to mobile, and more,” Zuckerberg said. But he also admitted that it will likely take years before Meta turns a profit on its AI investments. In January, Zuckerberg announced via an Instagram post that Meta will purchase some 350,000 Nvidia H100 AI chips by the end of the year. While Nvidia doesn’t release the exact price of its data center chips, estimates indicate they cost anywhere between $20,000 and $40,000 apiece. That would put Meta’s estimated costs well into the billions of dollars. Meta CFO Susan Li backed up Zuckerberg’s statements in her earnings note commentary, raising the company's full-year total expenses estimate from a range of between $94 billion and $99 billion to between $96 billion and $99 billion due to higher infrastructure and legal costs. Li said that the company’s investments will also increase in the years ahead. ""While we are not providing guidance for years beyond 2024, we expect capital expenditures will continue to increase next year as we invest aggressively to support our ambitious AI research and product development efforts,"" Li said. While Wall Street’s early reaction to Zuckerberg’s comments may have turned off some investors, experts say the investments will likely pay off in the long run more than, say, the company’s metaverse play. “There’s no doubt that Meta is all in on AI but to achieve its vision, the company must make big investments in infrastructure. Mark Zuckerberg’s ‘heads up’ was reminiscent of what he once said about the metaverse,” Forrester vice president and research director Mike Proulx said in a statement. “That didn’t exactly go so well, but this is different than Meta’s metaverse gamble because AI has real and practical use cases now. The question remains whether Meta can contend in the AI race while maintaining a strong financial position,” he added. William Blair analyst Ralph Schackart, meanwhile, said that while the timing and scale of Meta’s generative AI investments will be larger and longer than its prior build-outs, making moves now will put Meta in a more competitive position against rivals.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/metas-zuckerberg-cant-calm-wall-streets-nerves-on-ai-spending-stock-falls-10-180129766.html,META

Shares on Wall Street plummeted as official figures showed US GDP grew less than expected in the first three months of the year.

The core PCE prices index, which is closely watched by the Federal Reserve, rose to 3.7pc during the first quarter, ahead of analyst expectations of 3.4pc. As a result, traders pushed back their expectations for the first interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve, which is now priced in to happen by December rather than November.

You can’t blame investors for being skeptical of Meta’s enormous AI outlay,25/4/2024 14:53,David Meyer25 April 2024 at 7:53 am·3-min read,"There’s blood in the water. After a period of huge bullishness over generative AI, investors are starting to freak out about the massive costs involved, as evidenced by the reaction to Meta’s earnings yesterday. To be fair, there’s more than one reason why the Facebook and Instagram parent’s share price took a 15% dip in after-the-bell trading, once its quarterly results were out. While Q1 revenues were strong, with no pullback in Chinese ad-buying, Meta’s Q2 guidance was a bit lower than Wall Street hoped to see. But the scale of its AI investment—with Meta’s estimate for the year now up 12% to $35 billion to $40 billion in spending and with next year’s outlay set to be even greater—is what proved truly sobering, especially with so little to show for it just yet. CEO Mark Zuckerberg asked investors for patience and pointed out that Meta had “historically seen a lot of volatility in our stock during this phase of our product playbook where we’re investing and scaling a new product but aren’t yet monetizing it.” He also talked up the possibility of AI features in Meta’s apps attracting more users and therefore more ad revenue, and AI-powered smart glasses taking off, but that wasn’t enough to calm investors’ nerves. “The disappointment on the revenue side is overshadowing any optimism about AI,” Cresset Wealth Advisors chief investment officer Jack Ablin told Bloomberg. “It’s hard to tell what the benefit will be to users, and while AI could ultimately mean some cost savings down the line, that isn’t visible yet.” It is certainly true that big ideas need big investments, but if we’re talking this big, it’s very understandable that investors want to see some kind of solid strategy for profitability. This is particularly true in the case of Meta, which—lest we forget—was until recently going all-in on the metaverse, another very expensive endeavor that has so far turned out to be a money pit (Meta’s Reality Labs division lost over $16 billion last year, and $3.85 billion in Q1). Yes, AI has way more immediate, demonstrable uses than virtual reality does, but seeing it as a profitable venture still requires a hefty dollop of imagination. Another likely factor here is Meta’s open-source approach to releasing its Llama large language models. There are many real advantages to this, such as ensuring that there’s a powerful and attractive alternative out there to models from the likes of OpenAI and Google, and getting the wider community to help improve Meta’s AI. It may well pay off, but many investors will look at this strategy and ask where the moat is, and how Llama will make them tons of money. Is the reaction to Meta’s outlay a damning indictment of Big Tech AI investments in general? We’ll see after Microsoft and Alphabet’s results later today, but it’s worth remembering that those companies are also major cloud providers whose AI capex will likely pay off one way or another. Meta may find itself in a similar position after its spending spree—Zuckerberg hinted at the possibility—but right now that’s not the business it’s in. At this point it’s worth remembering that, like Elon Musk at Tesla, Zuckerberg is in the unusual position of being a law unto himself. Meta’s board can’t fire him, because of his voting control, and he has previously said that this allows him to take unpopular decisions that end up paying off. Meta’s vast AI expenditure could prove to be a serious test of that structure’s real utility, but either way, there’s nothing to stop investors from punishing the company if they don’t like what they see.

Movement Labs Raises $38M for Rollup Based on Facebook's Move Language,25/4/2024 14:46,Sam Kessler25 April 2024 at 7:46 am·4-min read,"Movement Labs, a blockchain company that aims to bring Facebook's Move Virtual Machine to Ethereum, has secured $38 million in a Series A financing round led by Polychain Capital. The firm was founded by Rushi Manche, 21, and Cooper Scanlon, 24 – Vanderbilt college dropouts who say they are on a mission to ""make blockchain security sexy"" with the launch of Movement L2, their new layer-2 Ethereum blockchain based on the Move programming paradigm. Manche said he got interested in Move after reading an article a few years ago, when he was still in college, about Facebook's efforts in the blockchain space. ""Security has never been a priority for the industry,"" Manche said in an interview. ""It's always, like, '$100 million hack,' '$20 million attack' – we're so succumbed and numb to the attack issue when in reality, that's a huge issue for retail."" Move is today best known for its association with Aptos and Sui, layer-1 blockchains with a focus on low fees and high throughput. By extending the tech to an Ethereum layer-2 – a blockchain that writes data to Ethereum but offers faster and cheaper transactions – the Movement team hopes to achieve greater security and transaction speeds than layer-2 incumbents. Movement's funding round saw participation from venture capital firms including Hack VC, Placeholder, Archetype, Maven 11, Robot Ventures, Figment Capital, Nomad Capital, Bankless Ventures, OKX Ventures, dao5, and Aptos Labs – the company behind Aptos. ""Between 2022 and 2023, hackers exploited smart contracts for over $5.4 billion, affecting major protocols like Curve and KyberSwap through common reentrancy attacks,"" Movement explained in a statement. ""Movement’s EVM allows Move and Solidity developers to deploy code that is fully verified at runtime, preventing attack vectors like reentrancy from executing."" ""With embedded firmware application runtime, we can stop 90% of attack vectors or more,"" Manche told CoinDesk. Move also uses parallelization – a method for processing multiple streams of activity at once that's used by Solana and Move-based chains to achieve greater transaction throughput. ""This combination of speed and security makes for a really powerful VM,"" said Manche. Move is the stand-out product of Meta's ill-fated foray into blockchain technology. Then still called Facebook, the company made a big splash in 2019 with the announcement that it was launching a cryptocurrency called ""Libra"" (later renamed ""Diem""). Diem's blockchain was supposed to use Move, a new open-source programming language based on Rust that Meta designed to make the entire process of coding up a blockchain more secure and efficient. ""In August 2022, I was in college with my co-founder at Vanderbilt and I read this article, 'Facebook is building a new programming language,'"" recalled Manche. ""I would use Cosmos and the [Ethereum Virtual Machine], but there weren't a lot of users – wasn't a lot of volume.""",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/movement-labs-raises-38m-rollup-144632208.html,META
Meta’s stock plunges 15% on ‘aggressive’ AI spending plans,25/4/2024 14:21,"Hanna Ziady, CNN25 April 2024 at 7:21 am·2-min read","Shares in Meta plunged Thursday, as the Facebook owner’s plans to “invest aggressively” in artificial intelligence spooked investors. The stock fell as much as 15% to $421.40 when the Nasdaq opened, wiping $183 billion off its market value. The selloff, which started in after-hours trade Wednesday, came as investors looked beyond bumper first-quarter earnings to focus on the huge costs to the company of building an AI future. Meta (META) is competing head-to-head with Microsoft and Google to unlock the enormous potential of AI. While the payoffs could be huge, the company’s most recent earnings underscored that building the best tools is costly and will take time. Meta, which also owns WhatsApp and Instagram, said Wednesday that first-quarter profit more than doubled year-on-year, while revenue was up 27%. But an increase of as much as $5 billion in projected AI investments — and the likelihood of further increases in subsequent years — made shareholders uneasy. “The language around spending plans has become bolder once more, and this could be what’s spooking markets,” Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, wrote in a note Thursday. “For all Meta’s bold AI plans, it can’t afford to take its eye off the nucleus of the business — its core advertising activities… Meta’s resources are vast but not infinite, and its digital advertising market share needs defending at all costs,” she added. Meta said full-year capital expenditure would be in the range of $35-40 billion — up from previous guidance of $30-37 billion — as it continues to accelerate infrastructure investments to support AI. “We expect capital expenditures will continue to increase next year as we invest aggressively to support our ambitious AI research and product development efforts,” the company added in a statement. On a call with investors, CEO Mark Zuckerberg focused most of his comments on AI. He said Meta wants to be “the leading AI company in the world” and “should invest significantly more over the coming years to build even more advanced models.” Meta would increase spending “meaningfully before we make much revenue from some of these new products… On the upside, once our new AI services reach scale, we have a strong track record of monetizing them effectively,” he added.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-stock-plunges-aggressive-ai-100035424.html,META
Meta value falls $190bn as investors react to plan to increase spending on AI,25/4/2024 14:00,Dan Milmo Global technology editor25 April 2024 at 7:00 am·1-min read,"Shares in Meta slumped 15% when Wall Street opened on Thursday, wiping about $190bn off the value of the Facebook and Instagram parent company, as investors reacted to a pledge to ramp up spending on artificial intelligence. Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s founder and chief executive, said on a conference call on Wednesday that spending on the technology would have to grow “meaningfully” before the company could make “much revenue” from new AI products. Shares in Meta had been boosted in 2023 by Zuckerberg’s tough action on costs in what he described as a “year of efficiency”. A relaxation of that restraint has rattled investors after Meta raised the upper bound of its capital expenditure guidance on Wednesday, from $37bn to $40bn. Last week, Meta released Llama 3, the latest version of its AI model, alongside an image generator that updates pictures in real time while users type prompts. The company’s AI-powered assistant, Meta AI, is expanding to its platforms in more than a dozen markets outside the US with the update, including Australia, Canada, Singapore, Nigeria and Pakistan. Chris Cox, Meta’s chief product officer, said the company was “still working on the right way to do this in Europe”. The share decline follows a record gain in market value by Meta in February, when the company added $196bn to its stock market capitalisation – a measure of a company’s worth – after declaring its first dividend. At the time it was the biggest one-day gain in Wall Street history. However, weeks later, Nvidia, the leading supplier of chips for training and operating AI models, smashed that record with a $277bn gain. As shares of former president Donald Trump's Truth Social meme stock continue to plummet, Devin Nunes, CEO of parent company Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), is accusing Wall Street of unfairly betting against the pump-and-dump scheme. As CNBC reports, Nunes claimed that the company's stock was the target of ""unlawful manipulation"" in a letter […] A year after the failure of Credit Suisse, the Swiss government says UBS may have to find as much as $27 billion to absorb potential losses. Now, the giant Swiss lender is hitting back, saying its finances are robust.

However, according to Cathie Wood of Ark Invest, Ethereum (ETH) could catch up to Bitcoin and provide investors with huge profits in the coming years.

EU court adviser backs data privacy activist Schrems in Meta fight,25/4/2024 13:04,Foo Yun Chee25 April 2024 at 6:04 am·1-min read,"By Foo Yun Chee BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Austrian privacy activist Max Schrems on Thursday received backing from an adviser to Europe's top court in his fight against Meta Platforms over personalised advertising based on processing of personal data. The adviser's opinion is non-binding, but judges at the Luxembourg-based Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), follow the majority of such recommendations. It will rule on the case in the coming months. Schrems, who has repeatedly sued Meta for alleged breaches of the EU's privacy law known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), took his grievance to an Austrian court, saying he regularly received advertisements directed at homosexuals. The court subsequently asked the CJEU for guidance. CJEU advocate general Athanasios Rantos sided with Schrems. ""The Court should rule that the GDPR precludes the processing of personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising without restriction as to time,"" he said in his opinion. ""A public statement by the user of a social network about his or her sexual orientation renders those data 'manifestly public', without, however, permitting their processing for the purposes of personalised advertising."" Schrems lawyer Katharina Raabe-Stuppnig said political comments on social media should not be allowed to be used for targeted political advertising. ""At the moment, the online advertising industry simply stores everything forever. The law is clear that the processing must stop after a few days or weeks. For Meta, this would mean that a large part of the information they have collected over the last decade would become taboo for advertising,"" she said.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/eu-court-adviser-backs-data-130401833.html,META
Forget Meta-Led Slump: 3 Reasons to Buy Tech ETFs on the Dip,25/4/2024 12:00,Sanghamitra Saha25 April 2024 at 5:00 am·4-min read,"Meta Platforms Inc. META, the parent company of Facebook, saw a stock slump of 15.2% in after-hours trading on Apr 24, 2024, as disappointing revenue guidance for the current quarter and plans for increased capital expenditures outshined the earnings beat. Meta, being a member of “Magnificent Seven,” has the ability to pull strings in the broader technology market. No wonder, the tech-heavy Invesco QQQ Trust ETF QQQ dropped 1.1% after hours. Despite Meta's intentions to utilize AI in its operations, the current outlook doesn't suggest many benefits from AI adoption. Jack Ablin, Chief Investment Officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors, said that the lack of clarity on AI's benefits to users and the absence of visible cost savings are key concerns for investors, per a Bloomberg article. The repercussions extended beyond Meta are hurting other key tech players. Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp. experienced declines of around 3.3% and more than 2.5%, respectively. Social media companies such as Snap Inc. (down 5.2% after hours), Pinterest Inc. (down 4.4% after hours) and Reddit Inc. (down 1% after hours) saw notable drops, indicating uneasiness in the broader market. Let’s discuss a few factors that indicate why investors should not turn their faces from the tech investing arena and why subdued revenue growth could be a new normal for tech companies. Technological advancements are part and parcel of our lives and so should tech ETFs be in our portfolios. In the last 20 years, Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF XLK witnessed a 11.05% compound annual U.S. inflation-adjusted return, while the figure has been 17.35% over the past 10 years. Easy Comps Likely Receding for Big Tech: Time to Get Accustomed? UBS Global Research has revised its outlook for the ""Big Six"" tech companies — Apple, Amazon, Google-parent Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft and NVIDIA — from ""Overweight"" to ""Neutral,"" according to a recent statement by Jonathan Golub, the chief U.S. equity strategist at UBS Investment Bank, according to a source. Golub said that the downgrade is not based on rich valuations or concerns about the sustainability and momentum of the AI technology. Instead, he pointed out that tough comps compared to the pandemic period will pose threats to future growth rates. A reduction in costs and easy comparisons boosted big tech companies’ profits, which peaked in the fourth quarter of 2023. But this jump will likely be followed by a decline in earnings, going forward. Since the tech sector’s solid fundamentals are still in place, investors should not worry much about tougher comps. Strong Long-Term Future for Tech “New normal” trends like work-and-learn-from-home and online shopping, increasing digital payments and growing video streaming are sure to stay here even if the pandemic has ebbed.

Microsoft debuts new Copilot+ PCs using OpenAI's GPT-4o while taking shots at Apple,20/5/2024 18:04,Daniel Howley·Technology Editor20 May 2024 at 11:04 am·3-min read,"Microsoft (MSFT) is going all in on AI for the PC. The company on Monday announced a new category of PCs called Copilot+ PCs, a new variety of computers equipped with so-called AI PC chips and running Microsoft's latest version of Windows 11 and its Copilot AI software. Microsoft also revealed that its Copilot+ PCs will now run on OpenAI's GPT-4o model, allowing the assistant to interact with your PC via text, video, and voice. Users will also be able to share their screen with Copilot and have a natural conversation with the app. ""The richest AI experiences will harness the power of the cloud and the edge working together in concert. This in turn will lead to a new category of devices that turn the world itself into a prompt,"" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said on Monday. ""For us, this vision starts with our most beloved and most widely used canvas: Windows."" Microsoft's new PC push comes as the PC market enters the early innings of a turnaround after two years of declines. According to IDC, PC shipments grew 1.5% in the first quarter, compared to a 28.7% decline during the same time in 2023. Yusuf Mehdi, Microsoft executive vice president and consumer chief marketing officer, said the company expects over 50 million AI PCs to be purchased over the next year. Copilot+ PCs are an offshoot of AI PCs, which are generally defined as PCs running on Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), and Qualcomm (QCOM) chips with built-in neural processing units, or neural engines, that can run generative AI applications locally without needing to connect to the internet. Copilot+ PCs will include 16GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage to ensure performance. In a pre-recorded demonstration of Copilot's GPT-4o integration, a user fired up the game Minecraft and asked Copilot how to craft a sword. The assistant could see what the user was doing in the game and walk him through everything he needed to do to build the item. Microsoft says it will integrate Copilot for a number of gaming apps, and because it will run on your PC's NPU rather than its GPU, it shouldn't hurt overall performance.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-debuts-new-copilot-pcs-using-openais-gpt-4o-while-taking-shots-at-apple-180409406.html,MSFT
Satya Nadella transformed Microsoft’s culture during his decade as CEO by turning everyone into ‘learn-it-alls’ instead of ‘know-it-alls’,20/5/2024 19:58,Chloe Berger20 May 2024 at 12:58 pm·3-min read,"Smart alecks rub most people the wrong way, including, but not limited to, Satya Nadella. Taking the helm at the software company 10 years ago, Nadella wasn’t afraid of making waves and pushing his new employees to think differently. Instead of resting on its laurels, Microsoft must “stay humble, stay hungry, and exhibit a growth mindset,” he told Fortune’s Jeremy Kahn. Those who live by a growth mindset “believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work—brains and talent are just the starting point,” Carol Dweck, coiner of the term and a Stanford psychologist, said in 2015. That’s contrasted from a fixed mindset, wherein people believe their skills are innate or a fixed quality, or that “talent alone creates success.” Nadella doesn’t buy the latter concept. Staying on your toes in the ever-developing tech world where AI is changing the game means sometimes being willing to dance a bit, or move with the flow. Indeed, the growth mindset has become the software company’s most favored buzzword of the decade, leaping from every intro psych class textbook into the speeches of Microsoft executives. The shift from being a “know-it-all” to “learn-it-all” is a defining part of Nadella’s messaging when it comes to his desired workplace culture, writes Kahn. At Microsoft, being a learn-it-all requires an embrace of upskilling, according to a company blog post, which said it’s difficult, if not impossible, to gain new skills if a company's culture says ""we’ve learned all we can."" “If you take two kids at school, one of them has more innate capability but is a know-it-all. The other person has less innate capability but is a learn-it-all. The learn-it-all does better than the know-it-all,” Nadella said back in 2019 on the podcast Hello Monday. That’s a sharp left turn from a pre-Nadella culture, explained Scott Hanselman, vice president of Microsoft’s developer community. The change is seen down to the software itself. Hanselman said the tech giant had a reputation for forcing developers to use the company’s entire tech stack. There’s less of a top-down approach at play now, as developers are now allowed to select certain features to implement and are asked for feedback on what they’d like to see more from the company. “Azure is beholden to them; they are the customer, and they will keep using it if they find it helpful and delightful,” he told Kahn.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/satya-nadella-transformed-microsoft-culture-195843116.html,MSFT

Microsoft's AI chatbot will 'recall' everything you do on a PC,20/5/2024 21:55,"MATT O'BRIEN, MANUEL VALDESUpdated 20 May 2024 at 2:55 pm·3-min read","REDMOND, Wash. (AP) — Microsoft wants laptop users to get so comfortable with its artificial intelligence chatbot that it will remember everything you're doing on your computer and help figure out what you want to do next. The software giant on Monday revealed a new class of AI-imbued personal computers as it confronts heightened competition from Big Tech rivals in pitching generative AI technology that can compose documents, make images and serve as a lifelike personal assistant at work or home. The announcements ahead of Microsoft's annual Build developer conference centered on fusing its AI assistant, called Copilot, into the Windows operating system for PCs, where Microsoft already has the eyes of millions of consumers. The new features will include Windows Recall, giving the AI assistant what Microsoft describes as “photographic memory” of a person's virtual activity. Microsoft promises to protect users' privacy by giving them the option to filter out what they don't want tracked, and keeping the tracking on the device. It's a step toward machines that “instantly see us, hear, reason about our intent and our surroundings,” said CEO Satya Nadella. “We’re entering this new era where computers not only understand us, but can actually anticipate what we want and our intent,"" Nadella said at an event at the company's headquarters in Redmond, Washington. The conference that starts Tuesday in Seattle follows big AI announcements last week from rival Google, as well as Microsoft's close business partner OpenAI, which built the AI large language models on which Microsoft's Copilot is based. Google rolled out a retooled search engine that periodically puts AI-generated summaries over website links at the top of the results page; while also showing off a still-in-development AI assistant Astra that will be able to “see” and converse about things shown through a smartphone’s camera lens. ChatGPT-maker OpenAI unveiled a new version of its chatbot last week, demonstrating an AI voice assistant with human characteristics that can banter about what someone's wearing and even attempt to assess a person’s emotions. The voice sounded so much like Scarlett Johansson playing an AI character in the sci-fi movie “Her” that OpenAI dropped the voice from its collection Monday. OpenAI also rolled out a new desktop version of ChatGPT designed for Apple's Mac computers.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/microsofts-ai-chatbot-recall-everything-185736872.html,MSFT

Is Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) the Best Quality Dividend Stock to Buy According to Reddit?,20/5/2024 16:43,Vardah Gill20 May 2024 at 9:43 am·5-min read,"Dividend stocks are in the limelight this year as many tech companies have joined the dividend club since the start of 2024. In addition to this, global companies have distributed a record amount in dividends last year. Retail investors are always on the lookout for income stocks. For this reason, we have analyzed the 15 Best Quality Dividend Stocks to Buy According to Reddit in a new article. In this article we are going to take a look at whether Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the best quality dividend stock to buy according to Reddit. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a Washington-based multinational technology company that is mainly known for its Windows operating systems. In addition to this, the company also offers a wide range of services through its cloud-computing platform. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was the most popular company among elite funds at the end of Q4 2023, with 302 hedge funds holding stakes in the company, as per Insider Monkey’s database. The collective value of these stakes is over $87.3 billion. drserg / Shutterstock.com Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has revolutionized both personal and business computing with its products for the software industry. The company’s Azure cloud computing platform is widely gaining momentum among business professionals. Its revenue from cloud services is a significant contributor to its total earnings. In the company’s most recent quarter, it reported a 23% year-over-year growth in its cloud revenue at over $35 billion. Vulcan Value Partners mentioned Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q1 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say: “Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the world’s largest software company with a broad range of offerings including Microsoft office, gaming, Azure cloud computing, LinkedIn, and more. It was a material contributor for the second consecutive quarter, and we discussed it at length in last quarter’s letter. The company continues to execute well.” Where tech companies mainly prefer reinvesting profits into growth and innovation, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) changed the paradigm and initiated its dividend policy in 2003 with a per-share dividend of $0.08. The company has been growing its payouts for the past 18 consecutive years, currently offering a quarterly dividend of $0.75 per share. In addition to this, the company’s 5-year average dividend growth rate comes in at 10.23%. With a payout ratio of 25.3%, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s dividend is also sustainable. This means that the company distributes less than one-third of its profits to shareholders as dividends. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) recently announced its fiscal Q3 2024 earnings and reported revenue of roughly $61.8 billion, which showed a 17% growth from the same period last year. The revenue not only showed growth but also beat analysts’ estimates by $1.01 billion. Its operating income amounted to $27.6 billion, up 23% from the third quarter of 2023. During the quarter, the company generated $32 billion in operating cash flow, up from $24.4 billion in the prior year period. The company’s solid cash position enabled it to uphold its commitment to shareholders by returning $8.4 billion to them through dividends and share repurchases in Q3 2024. While Microsoft Corporation's (NASDAQ:MSFT) dividend is strong and sustainable, the stock’s dividend yield tends to come up short when compared to some other high-yield dividend stocks in the market. As of May 18, the stock has a dividend yield of 0.71%, which is less than a 1.3% yield for the S&P 500. The low dividend yield does not satisfy income investors, who seek regular income on their dividend investments. The stock can be added to a diversified dividend portfolio but this means missing out on other high-yield dividend stock opportunities. According to the Reddit community, Microsoft is currently offering strong financial health along with stable dividend growth. However, some Redditors expressed concerns about the stock being modestly overvalued. The stock is currently trading at a P/E multiple of 36.5x, which is seen as too high by some. Moreover, its competitive industry may push the company to prioritize capital expenditure over dividends to remain relevant.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-corporation-nasdaq-msft-best-164343928.html,MSFT
Sony Had A Good Q4 Game But It Needs To Figure Out How To Evolve Beyond PlayStation,20/5/2024 16:11,Upwallstreet20 May 2024 at 9:11 am·2-min read,"On Tuesday, Sony Group Corporation (NYSE: SONY) reported its fourth quarter results. Sony’s net profit grew from stronger earnings that were generated by its gaming and move business. For the three months that ended in March,  Sony reported revenue grew 13% YoY to 3.481 trillion yen, while net profit rose 34% YoY to 189.005 billion yen which is about $1.21 billion. The gaming business reported that operating profit more than doubled to 105.98 billion yen, while the movie business followed with a nearly doubled operating profit of 30.67 billion yen. For the fiscal year, Sony sold 20.8 million units of PlayStation 5, which is more than 19.1 million units it sold during the previous fiscal year. Like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Sony annoucned it will be laying off about 900 employees from its PlayStation business in response to the videogame industry’s struggles to regain its vigor in a post-pandemic reality. Back in October, Microsoft laid off about 8% of its videogaming workforce. Even GameStop Corporation (NYSE: GME) also announced job cuts. Moreover, the videogame retailer’s stock plummeted on Friday as meme-stock mania faded. GameStop reported preliminary first quarter results and they showed a first quarter drop in sales. GameStop expects first quarter sales to range between $872 million to $892 million while it reported $1.24 billion during last year’s comparable quarter. But, GameStop is also expecting to narrow down its net loss from last year’s $50.5 million to somewhere between $27 million and $37 million. The Japanese entertainment and electronics company plans to spin off its financial business, which is why it guided for a revenue drop of 5.5% to 12.310 trillion yen and a net profit decline of 4.7% to 925 billion yen. However, Sony guided for its game business operating profit to continue to rise at 6.8% to 310 billion yen. Sony also expects its movie business profits to rise 2% to 120 billion yen. Sony and Microsoft rivalry will live on, but there’s bigger fish to fry. Both for Sony and its rival Microsoft, findings ways to grow revenue is more important than winning the console war. Microsoft undoubtedly upleveled its game by acquiring Activision Blizzard but console wars are becoming less and less relevant as both Microsoft and Sony need to figure out how to evolve in the new gaming era that is in the making.

Quote Nevertheless, we believe that Snowflake shares are attractive at the current level due to an innovative portfolio, a strong partner base and an expanding clientele.Snowflake currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with a Growth Score of A, a combination that offers a good investment opportunity, per the Zacks proprietary methodology. A Momentum Score of B makes SNOW further attractive to investors. You can find the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. SNOW has been suffering from challenging macroeconomic conditions, including persistent inflation, which have hurt its customer spending patterns. Although bookings grew meaningfully in the fiscal fourth quarter, reflecting an improved macroeconomic environment, the consumption trend is expected to have been sluggish.However, Snowflake has been riding on an expanding portfolio. Snowpark is expected to contribute 3% to product revenues in fiscal 2025. Product revenues are expected to be $3.25 billion, indicating 22% year-over-year growth for fiscal 2025.The growing adoption of Snowpark by data scientists and engineers is expected to have aided the company’s top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter. For first-quarter 2025, Snowflake expects revenues between $745 million and $750 million, implying year-over-year growth between 26% and 27%.Newly introduced solutions, including Cortex, a new fully-managed service making AI simple and secure, Streamlit in Snowflake, Snowpark ML Modeling API, and Cortex ML functions, are expected to have benefited top-line growth.

This accomplishment enhances Snowflake’s credibility in serving government entities.In fourth-quarter fiscal 2024, Snowflake added 83 customers, with product revenues exceeding $5 million in the trailing 12 months, increasing from 75 customers in the third quarter. The trend is expected to have continued in the fiscal first quarter.However, higher investments in AI-related initiatives are expected to drive the cost of revenues. Increased consumption-based commissions worth roughly $30 million are expected to hurt profits in fiscal 2025. Snowflake’s strong portfolio, with the growing adoption of solutions like Snowpark, significantly boosts its prospects.

4 Blue-Chip Stocks in Focus as Dow Hits New Milestone,20/5/2024 13:04,Ritujay Ghosh20 May 2024 at 6:04 am·5-min read,"Wall Street has resumed its rally this month after a brief pause in April as investors appear to be confident after a spate of favorable economic data, raising optimism about a rate cut soon. All the three major indexes hit a fresh all-time high last week, with the Dow leading from the front. The Dow gained 0.3% on Friday to close at 40,003.59, clinching a fresh record high. The index crossed 40,000 for the first time on May 16. The Dow has been on a rally since the beginning of the year. The Dow has registered 19 record closing highs in 2024. Year to date, the blue-chip index has gained 7.9% and has now ended in the green for five consecutive weeks. Positive economic data has been responsible for the Dow’s recent rally. The Labor Department reported earlier this month that inflation eased in April after increasing in the first three months of the year. The consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.3% month over month in April, lower than the consensus estimate of a rise of 0.4%. On a year-over-year basis, CPI rose 3.4%, in line with analysts’ expectations. Core CPI, which excludes the volatile food and energy prices, also rose 0.3% sequentially in April after increasing 0.4% in the first three months of the year. Year over year, CPI rose 3.6% in April, the lowest monthly increase since April 2021. Besides, job additions to the economy slowed in April, indicating that the labor market is finally cooling. Also, U.S. GDP grew a meager 1.6% in the first quarter after rising 3.4% in the final quarter of 2023, suggesting a slowdown. A slowdown in the manufacturing and services sector PMI in April further suggested a slowing economy, fueling the rally. Investors are again optimistic that the Federal Reserve will soon start its planned rate cuts. Last month, the central bank said that it’s unlikely that there will be another interest rate hike. Moreover, the Fed still plans three 25-basis-point rate cuts by the end of 2024. Markets are now pricing in a 73.2% chance that the Fed will cut the benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points in September, according to the CME FedWatch tool.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/4-blue-chip-stocks-focus-130400181.html,MSFT

Microsoft debuts 'Copilot+' PCs with AI features,20/5/2024 22:20,Max A. CherneyUpdated 20 May 2024 at 3:20 pm·4-min read,"By Max A. Cherney SEATTLE (Reuters) -Microsoft on Monday debuted a new category of personal computers with AI features as it rushes to build the emerging technology into products across its business and compete with Alphabet and Apple. At an event on its campus in Redmond, Washington, Chief Executive Satya Nadella introduced what Microsoft calls ""Copilot+"" PCs, saying that it and a range of manufacturers would sell them, including Acer and Asustek Computer. Microsoft launched the laptops as its shares trade near record highs following a Wall Street rally driven by expectations that AI will fuel strong profit growth for the company and its Big Tech rivals. Able to handle more artificial-intelligence tasks without calling on cloud data centers, the new computers will start at $1,000 and begin shipping on June 18. The ability to crunch AI data directly on the computer lets Copilot+ include a feature called ""Recall."" ""Recall"" tracks everything done on the computer, from Web browsing to voice chats, creating a history stored on the computer that the user can search when they need to remember something they did, even months later. The company also demonstrated its Copilot voice assistant acting as a real-time virtual coach to a user playing the ""Minecraft"" video game. Yusuf Mehdi, who heads up consumer marketing for Microsoft, said the company expects that 50 million AI PCs will be purchased over the next year. At the press event, he said faster AI assistants that run directly on a PC will be ""the most compelling reason to upgrade your PC in a long time."" Global PC shipments dipped about 15% to 242 million last year, according to research firm Gartner, which suggests Microsoft expects the new category of computers to account for around one-fifth of all PCs sold. ""People just need to be convinced that the device experience alone justifies this entirely new category of Copilot+ machines,” said analyst Ben Bajarin of Creative Strategies.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-unveil-ai-devices-features-100141507.html,MSFT
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is facing the AI arms race with urgency—and maybe a little paranoia,20/5/2024 9:47,"Diane Brady, Nicholas Gordon20 May 2024 at 2:47 am·3-min read","Good morning. In his decade as CEO of Microsoft, Satya Nadella has transformed a troubled tech giant into the world’s most valuable company, with a market cap of more than $3.1 trillion. In his 32 years at Microsoft, though, Nadella has lived through four major technology platform shifts—from PCs to the web, mobile, cloud computing and now AI—and he knows how the company struggled to compete after some of them. That may explain the air of urgency and mild paranoia that Nadella projects in Fortune’s latest cover story on Nadella by my colleague Jeremy Kahn. As Nadella told Jeremy: “When the paradigm shifts, do you have something to contribute? Because there is no God-given right to exist if you don’t have anything relevant.” With Microsoft’s partnership and $13 billion-plus investment in OpenAI, Nadella has given the tech giant a clear lead in the AI era. (The Microsoft Build developer conference kicks off tomorrow and is likely to feature several significant AI-fueled upgrades.) As Jeremy points out in his article, the company’s ties to OpenAI also come with risk, as we saw when OpenAI’s board fired—and then begrudgingly rehired—CEO Sam Altman last year. The recent departure of OpenAI researchers Ilya Sutskever and Jan Leike also sparked concern since it led to the dissolution of a team focused on the safety of hypothetical future AI systems that would be more capable than any human. And plenty of rivals are rushing in to compete. No one is more aware of the risks than Nadella. He lived through the Microsoft antitrust case in the late 1990s that forced the company to open up its Windows operating system to competition after it was found guilty of trying to monopolize the browser market. That experience may have factored into the company's recent decision to unbundle its Teams videoconference app from its Office software (though the still-looming threat of EU antitrust action was likely a bigger impetus). He saw Microsoft make failed bets on media players, cell phones, tablets and other technologies. He notices when customers give a piece of their business, however small, to a rival.  But Nadella is perhaps most sensitive to public scrutiny, telling Jeremy that what keeps him up at night is the possibility that his company might lose “its license to operate”—the one that relies on maintaining public trust by being a force for good in the communities in which it operates. Maintaining that license means investing in local economies, as he recently demonstrated with several announcements in Asia. It means figuring out how to meet Microsoft's 2030 goals to become carbon negative when its AI push has sent CO2 emissions up 30% since 2020. And throughout his tenure, it has meant trying to create and sustain a culture that’s humble, hungry and ready to grow. Check out Jeremy’s story here. More news below.

Satya Nadella’s far-sighted bets have made Microsoft a huge success. His biggest fear: that he’ll miss tech’s next big shift,20/5/2024 9:30,Jeremy Kahn20 May 2024 at 2:30 am·27-min read,"Something has caught Satya Nadella’s attention. It’s a small thing—just a five-letter word inside a box, lurking in the corner of a complicated PowerPoint slide, flashed on a screen for a fraction of a second inside a convention hall in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. But it niggles. “You’re doing also Llama? You’re using both?” Nadella asks, a note of surprise in his voice. Llama is the AI model, not the animal. It is a piece of open-source software created by Meta, the social media giant that has pivoted hard to AI and is competing with Microsoft and others to dominate the foundations of the emerging generative AI economy. “Both” is a reference to the fact that this Malaysian agriculture technology company—chosen to show off its use of Microsoft’s technology to Microsoft’s CEO— is using Meta’s rival AI model in addition to GPT-4, the large language model (LLM) created by Microsoft’s strategic partner, OpenAI. Nadella wants his Redmond, Wash.–based software giant to have the most capable, popular AI models on the market. “Um, yep, so we are, we are using Llama also,” says Adrian Lee, the chief technology officer at Agroz, the Malaysian startup, a hint of embarrassment in his reply. Agroz, which builds hydroponic farms, has created an AI chatbot to answer farmers’ questions about how best to tend their lettuce and bok choy.  “What are you using Llama for?” Nadella asks pointedly, standing before Lee at Agroz’s exhibition kiosk. Agroz, Lee explains, eventually wants to use humanoid robots for farming, and the robots may need to operate offline. Some versions of Meta’s Llama model are compact enough to be embedded in robots or phones, unlike the larger GPT-4. “Take a look at Phi,” Nadella says, switching from CEO-as-chief-market-researcher to CEO-as-chief-salesman. Phi is a family of small language models Microsoft has built in-house and offered, like Llama, as open-source software. Nadella apparently knows the parameter count of the smallest Phi model off the top of his head, and he rattles it off—just 3.8 billion parameters, making it small enough to run “on the edge.” Lee says Agroz will experiment with Phi. Meanwhile Agroz’s CEO Gerard Lim offers Nadella some Agroz-grown bok choy. “Oh, you want me to eat it?” Nadella says. He takes a small piece. “Mmmm,” he says, chewing vigorously, and, no doubt, chewing over the lesson about how perilously competitive the AI race is. It’s a telling exchange. Few companies have benefited as much from the generative AI boom as Microsoft. Investor fervor for the technology has helped make Nadella’s company a perennial contender for the title of the world’s most valuable corporation, with a market cap that consistently bobs somewhere in excess of $3 trillion. When Nadella took the reins at Microsoft in 2014, the company was floundering. Under his predecessor, Steve Ballmer, it had missed the smartphone revolution, was lagging on tablets, and was even losing market share in the PC operating system business that made it a household name. Microsoft’s shares had fallen more than 40% during Ballmer’s tenure. In 10-plus years as CEO, Nadella has reinvigorated the company, successfully steering it through two technological transformations: from PCs to the era of cloud computing, and now, to the age of AI. Nadella’s prescient and early bet on OpenAI and its technology, and the fruitful-if-sometimes-tense relationship that ensued, have given Microsoft as good a shot as any company at supremacy in this new era. The company arguably hasn’t been this powerful since it dominated the PC market in the 1990s’ “Wintel” era. But as Nadella begins his second decade at the helm, there’s no guarantee Microsoft will retain its lead. Regulators, hackers, and rivals each present threats serious enough to potentially undermine its industry leadership. Above all, it must reckon with its own leviathan size—and avoid becoming a victim of bureaucracy and bloat when AI’s protean nature calls for speed, agility and finesse.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/satya-nadella-far-sighted-bets-093000489.html,MSFT

A late surge in the final stretch of trading pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJIA) to close above 40,000 for the first time ever Friday — a milestone that comes just 874 trading days after the Dow first closed above 30,000. The blue-chip index added 1.2% for the week, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq (^IXIC) both recorded their longest weekly winning streaks since February. “Psychologically it's amusing,” JPMorgan Asset Management’s Jack Manley said of the milestone on Yahoo Finance’s ‘Morning Brief.’ “The rally feels good because the macro data has been pretty good,” he said. Goldman Sachs (GS), Microsoft (MSFT), and UnitedHealth (UNH) were the top three point contributors to the Dow’s charge from 30,000 to 40,000. And the makeup of the Dow looks different than it did during previous milestones. The index most recently replaced Walgreens (WBA) with Amazon (AMZN), bringing it to its current composition. This week’s softer inflation print helped bolster the case for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates before year end, as more investors place their bets on a soft landing. In a note to clients this week, Truist co-chief investment strategist Keith Lerner wrote the recent rally is a “healthy sign and typical characteristic of a bull market,” suggesting “upside potential remains.”",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/dow-at-40000-why-stocks-still-have-plenty-of-room-to-run-160152850.html,MSFT

InvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today! Analysts at the investment bank RBC Capital Markets raised their target price on Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock from $450 to $500 on Friday, citing positive feedback from their recent investor meetings with Microsoft's Directors of Investor Relations. RBC stressed that AI remains a key growth driver for Microsoft, highlighting that the tech giant continues to make substantial investments in this rapidly developing sector. “While CapEx will likely continue to ramp and impact margins, Microsoft is following demand signals and is simultaneously focused on bringing the cost curve down,” analysts said in the note. “Advances like GPT-4o, which is more efficient, and Maia (custom AI silicon) will help drive down the cost curve,” they added. RBC also emphasized Microsoft's expertise in cloud services as a major advantage, providing a unified architecture for all AI workloads. Moreover, RBC noted that while Microsoft's core cloud business is still in its early stages, there is a clear trend of companies moving more workloads to the cloud. Azure's growth, excluding AI, has accelerated in the fiscal Q2, they noted. “Importantly, core Azure is benefiting from the broader AI roadmap, as one-third of the 50K+ Azure AI customers are net new to Azure,” analysts noted.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/5-big-analyst-ai-moves-033937607.html,MSFT
How China is using AI news anchors to deliver its propaganda,18/5/2024 7:00,Dan Milmo and Amy Hawkins18 May 2024 at 12:00 am·7-min read,"The news presenter has a deeply uncanny air as he delivers a partisan and pejorative message in Mandarin: Taiwan’s outgoing president, Tsai Ing-wen, is as effective as limp spinach, her period in office beset by economic under performance, social problems and protests. “Water spinach looks at water spinach. Turns out that water spinach isn’t just a name,” says the presenter, in an extended metaphor about Tsai being “Hollow Tsai” – a pun related to the Mandarin word for water spinach. This is not a conventional broadcast journalist, even if the lack of impartiality is no longer a shock. The anchor is generated by an artificial intelligence programme, and the segment is trying, albeit clumsily, to influence the Taiwanese presidential election. The source and creator of the video are unknown, but the clip is designed to make voters doubt politicians who want Taiwan to remain at arm’s length from China, which claims that the self-governing island is part of its territory. It is the latest example of a sub-genre of the AI-generated disinformation game: the deepfake news anchor or TV presenter. Such avatars are proliferating on social networks, spreading state-backed propaganda. Experts do say this kind of video will continue to spread as the technology becomes more widely accessible. “It does not need to be perfect,” said Tyler Williams, the director of investigations at Graphika, a disinformation research company. “If a user is just scrolling through X or TikTok, they are not picking up little nuances on a smaller screen.” Beijing has already experimented with AI-generated news anchors. In 2018, the state news agency Xinhua unveiled Qiu Hao, a digital news presenter, who promised to bring viewers the news “24 hours a day, 365 days a year”. Although the Chinese public is generally enthusiastic about the use of digital avatars in the media, Qiu Hao failed to catch on more widely. China is at the forefront of the disinformation element of the trend. Last year, pro-China bot accounts on Facebook and X distributed AI-generated deepfake videos of news anchors representing a fictitious broadcaster called Wolf News. In one clip, the US government was accused of failing to deal with gun violence, while another highlighted China’s role at an international summit. In a report released in April, Microsoft said Chinese state-backed cyber groups had targeted the Taiwanese election with AI-generated disinformation content, including the use of fake news anchors or TV-style presenters. In one clip cited by Microsoft, the AI-generated anchor made unsubstantiated claims about the private life of the ultimately successful pro-sovereignty candidate – Lai Ching-te – alleging he had fathered children outside marriage. Microsoft said the news anchors were created by the CapCut video editing tool, developed by the Chinese company ByteDance, which owns TikTok.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/china-using-ai-news-anchors-070000223.html,MSFT
"Apple’s iPad Pro is its most incredible product, but software holds it back",17/5/2024 19:59,Daniel Howley·Technology EditorUpdated 17 May 2024 at 12:59 pm·4-min read,"Apple’s (AAPL) latest 13-inch iPad Pro is a marvel of engineering. But software still hamstrings the iPad Pro’s true potential, relegating the device to a sleek, high-end package for consuming content rather than allowing the iPad Pro to realize its productivity potential. The company has packed its latest M4 processor with up to 10 CPU and 10 GPU cores, more than you’ll find in its current MacBook Air and at least one version of its MacBook Pro, into a tablet thinner than Apple’s iPod Nano. At just 5.1 millimeters thick, the iPad Pro feels like if you hold it by one end, the other will droop like a piece of loose-leaf paper. It doesn’t, of course. The 11-inch iPad Pro is almost as thin at 5.3 mm. Oh, and then there’s the new Ultra Retina XDR display. Apple says the screen combines two OLED panels to boost its overall brightness while offering the same exceptional benefits you’d get out of a normal OLED display. That means inky blacks and brilliant colors. And all of that is going to cost you. A base 13-inch iPad Pro with Apple’s Magic Keyboard will set you back $1,648. That’s more than a high-end 13-inch MacBook Air and an entry-level MacBook Pro. I could deal with that price, though, if the iPad Pro didn’t have one big setback — iPadOS. Over the years, the iPad has made progress toward offering more Mac-like capabilities. You can run multiple apps at the same time, connect to an external display for a larger workspace, group apps together, and more. But iPadOS still holds back the iPad Pro from its true potential.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/apples-ipad-pro-is-its-most-incredible-product-but-software-holds-it-back-195926849.html,MSFT

Elon Musk to expand Tesla gigafactory rocked by Left-wing protests,17/5/2024 17:00,James Titcomb17 May 2024 at 10:00 am·40-min read,"Elon Musk’s Tesla has been given the green light to expand its Berlin gigafactory despite environmental activists taking part in huge protests at the plant last week. The local council in Gruenheide, the Brandenburg municipality where the Berlin factory is based, voted 11 to six to allow the company to expand the facility, Tesla’s only European plant. The decision comes three months after local residents voted to block the expansion, which prompted Tesla to submit a scaled-down plan. The referendum was non-binding but the company had promised to revise its plans after the vote. Tesla’s Berlin gigafactory has become a hotspot for environmental and Left-wing protests in recent months, which culminated last week in scores of activists breaking through police lines to reach the walls of the facility. Several weeks earlier, the factory’s power supplies were vandalised, forcing it to stop production. A majority of councillors in Gruenheide voted in favour of the expansion plan, which is roughly half the size of Tesla’s previous proposal to clear around 250 acres of forest. The company hopes to double production to around 1m cars per year. The meeting featured demonstrations outside the local parliament, while those attending the meeting had their bags checked at the door amid a police presence. The expansion will still have to be approved by local environmental regulators and could be subject to legal challenges. It includes connecting the factory to a local train route to ease traffic congestion. Despite Tesla spearheading the electric car movement, many of the eco-activists have rejected car ownership altogether. They have claimed Tesla’s facility is polluting local water supplies and others oppose Mr Musk, the world’s third-richest person, as a symbol of capitalism.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-expand-tesla-gigafactory-170054839.html,MSFT
Does Reddit's (RDDT) OpenAI Partnership Make It Worth Buying?,17/5/2024 13:53,Aniruddha Ganguly17 May 2024 at 6:53 am·4-min read,"Reddit RDDT shares jumped 11.74% in after-hours trading on May 16, following the announcement of its partnership with Microsoft MSFT-backed OpenAI.The deal will bring Reddit content to OpenAI’s ChatGPT and other products and, at the same time, will help the social media company incorporate new AI-powered features into its forums. OpenAI will also become Reddit’s advertising partner.Since its initial public offering in March, Reddit shares have gained 22.6%, outperforming the Zacks Internet Software industry and the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector. Reddit’s huge data trove makes it an invaluable source for big techs like Alphabet GOOGL division Google, Amazon AMZN and Microsoft for training their large language models (LLMs). LLMs form the base of Generative AI applications.Generative AI and AI-related startups like OpenAI have attracted close to $50 billion in investments since 2023, affirming the growing interest in the technology and its applications. Microsoft invested close to $13 billion in OpenAI as it sought to gain a front seat in the startup’s AI innovations. Another startup, Anthropic, raised close to $2 billion and $4 billion from investors led by Alphabet’s division Google and Amazon, respectively, as it sought a valuation of close to $30 billion.OpenAI’s GPT-4, Anthropic’s Claude 3 Opus, and Google DeepMind’s Gemini Ultra are the three most capable tools currently available in the Generative AI domain. Reddit Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Reddit Inc. Quote   However, OpenAI and Anthropic are facing increasing competition from their original backers — Microsoft, Amazon and Google, respectively — as these big techs plan to build their own LLMs primarily because these are cheaper to build in-house and they can exercise more control on how to use the models. The OpenAI deal is expected to give them a glimpse of the potency of RDDT’s data in training their models.Reddit’s partnership with Google, which involves training the latter’s LLMs, has been a game changer. An expanded partnership in February this year made it easier for users to find, discover and engage in content and communities on Reddit that are most relevant to them.RDDT is already benefiting from growing data licensing deals as other revenues surged more than 450% year over year to $20 million in the first quarter of 2024. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s prospects are supported by strong ad revenue growth expectations driven by an expanding user base. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Reddit currently has a Zacks Momentum Score of A, which makes it further attractive. Google is playing an important role in expanding its user base as it is getting better at displaying RDDT’s content. In first-quarter 2024, Daily Active Uniques (“DAUq”) increased 37% year over year to 82.7 million. Logged-in DAUq: Global, which RDDT considers as the core metrics of the business, jumped 27% year over year to 43.1 million in the reported quarter.Reddit’s focus on making the platform faster and more user-friendly is noteworthy. It continues to invest in AI and machine learning to improve relevance, engagement and moderation. RDDT plans to deploy its own trained LLMs to improve moderation. These initiatives are expected to drive user engagement.Reddit’s plan to monetize its platform through the launch of a revamped version of user awards and Reddit Gold (its virtual currency) bodes well for its future prospects.Its focus on reducing campaign setup time for self-serve and small and medium businesses (SMBs), as well as the launch of free formats, which provide advertisers with a versatile and creative format to drive deeper engagement with users, is expected to drive ad revenues.Reddit Pro, a free suite of AI-powered insights and tools, is currently in beta with more than 1000 businesses, including Taco Bell, Wendy’s, NFL, the Wall Street Journal, as well as several SMBs. Shopping also remains on the horizon, with RDDT launching shopping ads and testing dynamic product ads. Reddit’s user-friendly and advertiser-friendly focus is a key catalyst. Upcoming user interface improvements, better on-platform search capabilities and monetization plans provide strong growth opportunities. RDDT plans to grow revenues twice as fast as cost growth over the long term, which surely makes the stock attractive for investors at its current level.

Sainsbury’s to work with Microsoft on AI tools to help customers and staff,17/5/2024 13:47,"Martyn Landi, PA Technology Correspondent17 May 2024 at 6:47 am·2-min read","Sainsbury’s has signed a deal with Microsoft to use the technology giant’s artificial intelligence tools to help customers and staff. The supermarket said it will use the technology to create more engaging stores and online shopping experiences for customers, while AI-powered data tools will help staff save time and focus on key tasks. It will use generative AI to create a more interactive online shopping experience, and improve product searches. For staff, Sainsbury’s said they will have access to real-time data for certain key processes, such as shelf replenishment, using AI and cameras on shelf edges to guide workers to the specific items that need restocking – saving time and freeing them up to focus on other priorities. The supermarket added it will also use AI-powered tools to address customer and staff queries.

UK watchdog decides not to investigate Microsoft's AI partnership with France's Mistral,17/5/2024 13:07,Associated Press Finance17 May 2024 at 6:07 am·1-min read,"LONDON (AP) — British regulators said Friday they don't need to open a competition investigation into Microsoft's partnership with French artificial intelligence company Mistral, a month after asking for industry feedback on the deal. Microsoft announced earlier this year that it was partnering with the buzzy French startup in a move that that could lessen the software giant’s reliance on ChatGPT-maker OpenAI for supplying the next wave of chatbots and other generative AI products. The Competion and Markets Authority said in a brief update that the tie-up “does not qualify for investigation"" under U.K. merger rules. The watchdog had said in April that it was seeking comments from “interested third parties,” before deciding whether to carry out an in-depth antitrust investigation. By deciding not to probe the deal, ""the CMA confirmed that the structure of the partnership between Mistral and Microsoft does not grant sufficient rights/influence to Microsoft,"" Alex Haffner, competition partner at U.K. law firm Fladgate, said by email. The watchdog is still looking into Microsoft's hiring of key staff from another startup, Inflection AI, as well as Amazon’s $4 billion investment in San Francisco-based Anthropic. It didn't provide updates on those reviews, which were announced at the same time last month. Nor has it issued an update on its review of Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI since it asked for comments on that deal in December. The mystery is over: Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a major stake in the insurance company Chubb, finally revealing the investment he has kept under wraps since last year.

Big Tech is pouring billions into British AI investments—but the U.K. risks becoming a sidekick to U.S. tech giants,17/5/2024 12:21,Noel Hurley17 May 2024 at 5:21 am·5-min read,"Microsoft’s plan to open a new AI hub in London is a huge endorsement for the U.K. as a world leader in AI. But I do question whether it is wholly good news for the long-term. The U.K. has shown time and again that some of the very best AI expertise in the world lies here. The pool of talent we have available in this country, the standard of research and development present in our academic institutions, and the U.K.’s (generally) stable economic conditions have, for decades, made our island nation a highly attractive place for tech’s big hitters to lay down roots. That’s why American businesses come here, as well as companies from Japan, China, South Korea, Germany, and Singapore. And recent history highlights the real pedigree we have in software process and design. In a recent interview, Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt declared his wishes for building a “British Microsoft,” warning that such an endeavor would take a decade to materialize. But it wouldn’t be the first time the U.K. has produced a tech titan of its own. I previously spent more than 20 years working at Arm, starting in the 1990s. During this time, the company grew from a small spinout (named Acorn Computers) in Cambridge, to a global tech behemoth. It became, arguably, the largest processor company in the world. This was made possible by talent from the likes of Cambridge, Oxford, UCL, Southampton, Manchester, and many other British academic institutions. We were the world leaders. Another breakthrough moment for U.K. AI was the founding of DeepMind in 2010. It was one of the most exciting AI companies in the world. But DeepMind was then acquired by Google in 2014 for a $400 million (a massive figure at the time). So why is it that with all this talent, our attention seems to constantly be on moves made by companies and capital from overseas, rather than focusing on building and keeping our own tech ventures, and turning them into the world players they could be? The fact that we herald the likes of Microsoft further embedding themselves into the fabric of U.K. tech surely begs the question as to why, as a nation, we haven’t cracked the code for building tech heavyweights of our own. Our universities are very capable of creating spinouts, the funding environment is conducive for raising, and early-stage venture capital is accessible. However, the capital required for these companies to continue growing and being capable of challenging the best tech businesses worldwide simply doesn’t exist. This is a challenge that the U.K. government isn’t yet addressing. We need to ensure that U.K. startups have the ability to scale and remain in the U.K. The goliath-sized funding round raised by U.K. self-driving car technology startup Wayve is a perfect example of this capital tipping point issue in action. The company recently secured $1.05 billion (£840 million) in funding led by Japan’s SoftBank, with Microsoft and Nvidia also participating. This is the largest known investment in an AI company in the U.K.—and more broadly Europe—to date, and it was once again driven by overseas capital.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/big-tech-pouring-billions-british-122143594.html,MSFT

Each company logged record quarterly cloud sales thanks to double-digit growth rates. Combined, these three cloud leaders generated more than $61 billion in total sales in the first quarter of 2024. Their cloud units, in fact, boosted total revenue growth as clients are increasingly adopting AI services. Growth rates are rebounding from the relative lows seen through most of 2023. Individually, Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud business generated $26.7 billion in total sales (up 21% year over year) during the quarter, meaning Microsoft’s cloud group now has a run rate of $107 billion. AWS generated just over $25 billion in revenues (up 17% year over year). This means Amazon’s cloud business now has an annual run rate of $100 billion. Google Cloud reported total sales of $9.6 billion (up 28% year over year). This shows that Alphabet’s cloud business currently has an annual run rate of $38.4 billion. In terms of global market share, AWS is leading (with a 31% share), followed by Microsoft (25%) and Google (11%). Other cloud market-share leaders of the first quarter included Alibaba BABA at 4% market share and Salesforce CRM at 3% cloud share.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/time-cloud-etfs-earnings-strength-120000396.html,MSFT

Here's why investors seem to be hesitant to own AMD stock: Mizuho,17/5/2024 10:18,Investing.com17 May 2024 at 3:18 am·2-min read,"Investors are growing increasingly skeptical about owning AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) stock, a Mizuho desk analyst highlighted in a new note. “Why add AMD if I own NVDA and AVGO here that are cheaper and feel much lower risk?” appears to be the key pushback among market participants, the analyst said. The chipmaker’s shares rose to an intraday high of $168 on Thursday, amid a broader surge in the technology sector driven by the recently released softer-than-expected inflation data. It seemed like a short squeeze was affecting much of the tech market, the analyst noted. Notably, AMD’s chipmaking peer Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) Technology was up 6-7% at one point despite the lack of any specific news or events. Meanwhile, AMD remains a significant short position for many East Coast hedge funds, and numerous long-only (LO) investors are steering clear of it ahead of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s Blackwell launch later this year. “Stock feels like a plane crash survivor on a life raft in middle of a massive ocean just looking for land,” the analyst wrote. “I remain a bull and love the risk reward if you have patience and duration (think 6-9 months). But I get the worry, hesitancy and concerns amongst investors.” Mizuho’s expert also said that AMD “could be the next Dell (NYSE:DELL),” another major hedge fund short that surged on a bullish preview from Morgan Stanley ahead of their earnings at the end of May. Meanwhile, new reports suggest that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) plans to promote AMD's MI300X GPUs for generative AI at their upcoming Build conference. While it’s known that Microsoft uses AMD's MI300 GPUs to balance Nvidia, recent negative calls in March and April implied that Microsoft was cutting orders to shift funds to Nvidia’s Blackwell GPUs, set for release later this year. “I would watch AMD today, and while this MSFT news itself is unlikely some major catalyst, any focus by MSFT on AMD’s MI300 next week to me feels like a positive catalyst as the cons view is MSFT will cut MI300 orders this yr and AMD will miss MI300 rev bogeys of $9-10B next yr,” the analyst concluded.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-investors-seem-hesitant-101833984.html,MSFT

Microsoft has asked at least 100 of its employees in China to consider moving to other countries, according to Chinese state media reports. The reports come as relations between Beijing and Washington deteriorate over technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and clean energy. Microsoft employees, mostly involved with cloud computing, were recently offered the opportunity to work in the United States, Australia or Ireland, among other countries, state-run outlet The Paper said in a report Wednesday, citing an unnamed source. “Providing internal opportunities is a regular part of managing our global business. As part of this process, we shared an optional internal transfer opportunity with a subset of employees,” a Microsoft spokesperson told CNN on Thursday. It did not specify the number of workers who had received the offer. The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Microsoft asked as many as 800 employees, mostly engineers with Chinese nationality working on cloud computing and AI, to consider relocating.

Microsoft offers cloud customers AMD alternative to Nvidia AI processors,17/5/2024 23:32,Max A. CherneyUpdated 17 May 2024 at 4:32 pm·2-min read,"By Max A. Cherney SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Microsoft said on Thursday it plans to offer its cloud computing customers a platform of AMD artificial intelligence chips that will compete with components made by Nvidia, with details to be given at its Build developer conference next week. It will also launch a preview of new Cobalt 100 custom processors at the conference. Microsoft's clusters of Advanced Micro Devices' flagship MI300X AI chips will be sold through its Azure cloud computing service. They will give its customers an alternative to Nvidia's H100 family of powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) which dominate the data center chip market for AI but can be hard to obtain due to high demand. To build AI models or run applications, companies typically must string together - or cluster - multiple GPUs because the data and computation will not fit on a single processor. AMD, which expects $4 billion in AI chip revenue this year, has said the chips are powerful enough to train and run large AI models. As well as Nvidia's top-shelf AI chips, Microsoft's cloud computing unit sells access to its own in-house AI chips called Maia. Separately, the Cobalt 100 processors Microsoft plans to preview next week offer 40% better performance over other processors based on Arm Holdings' technology, the company said. Snowflake and others have begun to use them. The Cobalt chips, which were announced in November, are being tested to power Teams, Microsoft's messaging tool for businesses, and positioned to compete with the in-house Graviton CPUs made by Amazon.com.

"Some of the most talented, high-ranking workers at Apple, Microsoft, and SpaceX jumped ship after return-to-office mandates, new study reveals",16/5/2024 16:02,Jane Thier16 May 2024 at 9:02 am·7-min read,"The focus of return-to-office discussions have long focused on the individuals. Why might workers prefer to stay home? Which age groups are most amenable to in-person work, and which are most combative? Does office collaboration make the most sense for creative types or heads-down numbers people? Can workers really be productive left to their own devices? Yet the lingering question of how widespread remote work shapes company outcomes, as well as the wider sector landscape, largely remains unanswered because the whole experiment remains in flux. But a new working paper from researchers at the University of Michigan and University of Chicago, titled “Return to Office and the Tenure Distribution,” comes fairly close to positing an answer: Return-to-office (RTO) mandates, when they’re not wanted, are bad news for companies looking to keep their talent. The researchers matched 260 million resumes to company data to analyze causal effects of RTO mandates on employees’ tenure at Microsoft, SpaceX, and Apple. In scientific terms, they found “a reduction in counterfactual tenure that increases for employees with longer tenure.” In layman’s terms: When the firms enacted RTO mandates, senior employees headed for the door—often to direct competitors—who let them work from home. The number of top-brass employees at Microsoft—as a share of the company headcount—dropped by over 5% post-mandate; at Apple, it was 4%. (Microsoft mandated 50% of the week in-office; Apple, just one day a week.) SpaceX was the worst of the bunch, with a 15% drop, which the researchers chalk up to its uniquely stringent requirement: Five days a week in-person. That human outflow poses an enduring threat to “productivity, innovation, and competitiveness”—the component parts that separate a thriving company from one in freefall. Microsoft’s internal data doesn’t align with the paper’s findings, Amy Coleman, its vice president of human resources and corporate functions, told Fortune via email. The term “return to office mandate” is also inaccurate, she said, adding that Microsoft is a hybrid workplace “that revolves around flexibility and a mix of workstyles across worksite, work location and work hours.” In 2022, Microsoft’s chief human resources officer Kathleen Hogan told Fortune the company considers “working from home up to 50% of the time as standard.” Representatives for Apple and SpaceX did not respond to Fortune’s request for comment, though an Apple spokesperson told the Washington Post that the study drew “inaccurate conclusions” and “does not reflect the realities” of Apple’s business or attrition rates. The statistical analysis came from People Data Labs resumé data, David Van Dijcke, a coauthor and University of Michigan economics PhD student, tells Fortune. “The takeaway is definitely that the effects [of RTO mandates] are more deleterious than people thought before.” Granted, the study is far from all-encompassing; it only studied three major firms, and they were all “early movers” in the RTO push, Van Dijcke acknowledges, pointing to each of their 2022 mandate announcements. That meant senior employees who left Microsoft, Apple, and SpaceX had “pretty good outside options,” namely competing companies that offered remote work with far fewer strings attached. “If we think of Covid as ending in 2022, that was certainly followed by an influx of people claiming they would leave—and then really leaving when the first return-to-office mandates happened,” Anthony Nyberg, a management professor at the University of South Carolina’s Darla Moore School of Business, tells Fortune. “Apple and Microsoft really agonized over how to change their policies—Amazon, too, made many public comments.” To be sure, Nyberg went on, mandating an office return is a major strategic decision—and even in the Michigan study, which found a statistically significant portion of high-earning workers leaving, it remains unclear whether that’s necessarily a bad thing for their former companies. “A big part of this is likely to become a sorting effect in terms of talent finding their best-fit organizations,” Nyberg says. “And people going to competing companies has been a truism for all of eternity.”",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/most-talented-high-ranking-workers-160212454.html,MSFT
"Google, Apple, and Microsoft make their products friendlier to users with disabilities",16/5/2024 14:47,David Meyer16 May 2024 at 7:47 am·3-min read,"It’s Global Accessibility Awareness Day today, and Big Tech firms have accordingly issued a flurry of announcements about how they’ll make their products friendlier to people whose use of devices is hindered by disabilities. Most coverage of Google’s I/O developer event this week may have focused on its generative AI news, but the company also announced an expansion of Project Gameface to the Android platform. Google announced that project last year—it’s an open-source, hands-free gaming “mouse” that uses the webcam to capture the gamer’s head movements and facial gestures, translating them into cursor movements via the magic of machine learning. Now Google is open-sourcing more of the code so developers can make better Android accessibility apps. Gaming may have been the inspiration for Project Gameface—specifically, the needs of a gaming streamer named Lance Carr, who has muscular dystrophy—but the applications clearly go far beyond, with Google promising use cases in educational and work settings too. In a similar vein, Apple yesterday also announced an upcoming iPhone and iPad feature called Eye Tracking. This does what the name suggests, giving users a way to navigate through and activate the elements of an app, just by letting the front-facing camera track their eye movements. Apple also revealed other accessibility features that will be coming soon: Music Haptics, which will help deaf or hard-of-hearing iPhone users experience music with the aid of “taps, textures, and refined vibrations”; Vocal Shortcuts, which will let users trigger complex tasks by uttering simple sounds; and a bunch of new accessibility features specific to the CarPlay and visionOS environments. Meanwhile, on the intriguing-hardware front, we have Microsoft’s announcement yesterday of the Proteus controller for Xbox and PC gamers. Designed by peripherals startup ByoWave, the Proteus is a kit comprising “snap and play” parts that let people customize a wireless controller according to their needs. There’s a “mother cube” that serves as the controller’s brain, a cube features the directional pad, a piece with a mini control stick, another two providing left and right triggers, and so on. There are many possible configurations, from traditional controller layouts to wand-like columns and tabletop-friendly rectangles. Preorders are open now, with the kit ($255 to first-comers, $299 thereafter) shipping in the fall. Microsoft also used the occasion of Global Accessibility Awareness Day to promise fixes for what some gamers with disabilities experienced from a major change that the company made last November when it started blocking the use of unauthorized accessories with the Xbox console. This has been an issue for those who had put together custom controller setups to fit their unique requirements, with equipment coming from small specialist manufacturers that aren’t official Microsoft licensees. Part of Microsoft’s solution is for those manufacturers to get in touch and make their controllers official, but the company is also updating its own Adaptive Controller, which the Xbox always accepts, to expand support for more accessories. The $99 Adaptive Controller is a clever piece of gear that includes some built-in controller functionality of its own, but more importantly acts as a hub for specialized equipment, such as switches that are controlled by biting, sipping, and puffing with the mouth, or with one's feet. “We appreciate and acknowledge that gaming with a disability is highly individualistic, and the solution for one may not be the solution for all,” the company said.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/google-apple-microsoft-products-friendlier-144738151.html,MSFT
How to Boost Your Portfolio with Top Computer and Technology Stocks Set to Beat Earnings,16/5/2024 13:00,Zacks Equity Research16 May 2024 at 6:00 am·2-min read,"Two factors often determine stock prices in the long run: earnings and interest rates. Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter. We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises. 2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist The Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure. The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Nvidia (NVDA) holds a Zacks Rank #1 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $5.68 a share six days away from its upcoming earnings release on May 22, 2024. NVDA has an Earnings ESP figure of 2.9%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $5.68 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.52. NVDA is one of just a large database of Computer and Technology stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Microsoft (MSFT). Microsoft is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on July 23, 2024. MSFT's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $2.90 a share 68 days from its next earnings release. Microsoft's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 0.33% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.89. Because both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, NVDA and MSFT could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/boost-portfolio-top-computer-technology-130004137.html,MSFT

Exciting new products built from generative AI models are just beginning to come to market and will continue to change the way we interact with technology. Just this week there were two significant releases from both Microsoft’s, OpenAI and Alphabet. Additionally, now that broad markets have traded sideways for the better part of two months, energy has been built for a major breakout in the leading names. These product releases should be a valuable catalyst for the next big rally. OpenAI introduced the newest iteration of their primary AI model, GPT-4o. The demonstrations of GPT-4o were extremely impressive, with one video showing the AI model interacting with and tutoring a young boy on his math homework. The GPT, young boy and father were all in conversation with each other, and the GPT helped him through the process in a supportive and logical way. It was really something, and I recommend those interested seek out some of the most recent demonstrations released online. Then, at Google I/O, Alphabet’s annual developer conference, the company introduced its newest AI enabled “Agents,” built throughout its platforms. This product is built on Gemini, Alphabet’s response to OpenAI’s GPT. In one demo, the presenter wanted to return a pair of shoes they bought online. They took a picture of them, and said to the agent, “I want to return these shoes, they don’t fit.” Gemini proceeded to find the order info in Gmail, fill out a return form, and scheduled a pickup from UPS. It really functioned like a personal assistant. The presentation also showed Gemini agents planning detailed trips catered to specific interests, summarizing long email chains, and working across multiple external websites to really simplify workflow.

Berkshire revealed it acquired nearly 26 million shares of Chubb in a Wednesday Securities and Exchange Commission filing of the company’s first-quarter investments. That translates to a value of approximately $6.7bn (£5.28bn). Berkshire had requested confidential treatment from the Securities and Exchange Commission in the third and fourth quarter of last year for one or more of its equity holdings. The treatment was sought presumably because Buffett wanted to accumulate Chubb without tipping off other investors and potentially boosting the price of Chubb shares. ""Chubb is an attractive equity investment for Berkshire because it operates in a business Berkshire knows well: property-casualty insurance,"" Cathy Seifert, a CFRA Research analyst who covers Berkshire, said in an email reported by Reuters.

D.C. is testing its Big Tech antitrust campaign far from D.C.,16/5/2024 8:00,Alexis Keenan·Reporter16 May 2024 at 1:00 am·6-min read,"The Biden administration is testing its antitrust push far from Washington as it seeks to unwind the dominance of Big Tech. No longer is the nation’s capital the go-to trial venue of choice for the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission as they file competition challenges against the biggest names in Silicon Valley. Instead, it’s New Jersey where the government chose to sue Apple (AAPL). Or California, where it challenged Microsoft (MSFT). Or the state of Washington, where it confronted Amazon (AMZN). Or Virginia, where it filed a second antitrust suit against Google (GOOG, GOOGL). ""They’re clearly filing these tech cases in different jurisdictions where the law is less developed,"" said Douglas Ross, a professor of antitrust at the University of Washington School of Law. ""And they're doing it for a reason."" A variety of strategies could explain the multi-jurisdictional approach, according to antitrust lawyers. Prosecutors could be targeting appeals courts with case law more favorable to their legal theories, since all of the district courts selected by Biden’s FTC and DOJ report to different courts of appeals. The government could also be weighing the speed of a court in handling litigation and the convenience to anticipated witnesses, said Juan Arteaga, a partner with Crowell & Moring’s antitrust litigation division. It’s also possible, he added, that government officials may want to showcase vigorous anticompetitive enforcement to the rest of the country. ""I think the current leadership team and the DOJ antitrust division have really made it a point to try to take antitrust enforcement out of the D.C. bubble,"" Arteaga said. Ross is more skeptical of a strategy that seeks out jurisdictions where judges have less antitrust experience and fewer controlling antitrust cases are on the books.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/dc-is-testing-its-big-tech-antitrust-campaign-far-from-dc-080007707.html,MSFT

Google is reinventing itself for the AI age,15/5/2024 17:54,Daniel Howley·Technology Editor15 May 2024 at 10:54 am·4-min read,"MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. — Google (GOOG, GOOGL) is in the midst of a full-blown AI evolution. On Tuesday, the company announced a flurry of AI products and services during its I/O developer conference with the aim of repositioning itself as the world’s AI software leader. “We are fully in our Gemini era,” CEO Sundar Pichai said during his keynote, referring to the company’s latest Gemini AI models, while noting that AI is still “in the very early days of the AI platform shift.” For years, Google was considered Silicon Valley’s AI powerhouse. But OpenAI and Microsoft (MSFT) threw the company off course, entering into a multibillion-dollar, multiyear partnership in 2023 that saw Microsoft integrate OpenAI’s most advanced models into its productivity, search, and cloud products. All this helped crown Microsoft as the world’s most valuable company earlier this year. Google’s climb back hasn’t been easy. It originally debuted a ChatGPT competitor called Bard that fell short of initial expectations. And more recently, it bungled the rollout of its generative AI-powered image generator, a tool that the company admitted was not “working the way we intended.” Stealing back the AI throne starts with Google reinventing its most important product: Search. Now — or soon, as it’s rolling out over time — at the top of the screen, you’ll find a generative AI-powered area called AI Overview that offers summarized responses to queries along with links to the sources. It’s a major departure for Google and could impact everything from the company’s advertisers, its main source of revenue, to websites that rely on the firm for search traffic, such as travel platforms and media organizations. While the Search changes are easily the biggest updates to Google’s public-facing products, they weren’t the only consequential announcements at the show. Google also showed off a new AI-powered prototype assistant called Project Astra. During a pre-recorded stage demo, the platform, which views content streamed through your smartphone camera, was able to identify objects, solve programming problems, and more. Unlike digital assistants Google Assistant and Apple’s (AAPL) Siri, Project Astra offers a more creative, conversational tone that sounds more human-like. It’s even able to understand when you interrupt it, stopping to listen without getting mad.

Tanking Profit Overshadowed Alibaba's AI Growth And Reignited Domestic E-Commerce,15/5/2024 15:05,Upwallstreet15 May 2024 at 8:05 am·3-min read,"On Tuesday, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA) reported its net profit took quite a dive during the fiscal fourth quarter, after already having a hard time throughout 2023 as it underwent its largest-ever corporate restructuring. For the quarter ended on March 31st, Alibaba posted revenue grew 7% YoY to 221.9 billion yuan, which amounts $30.7 billion, as it boosted domestic e-commerce sales. But, Alibaba reported its net income attributable to ordinary shareholders tanked as much as 86% YoY to 3.27 billion yuan, which is about $452 million, attributing the poor result to a net loss from investments in publicly-traded companies, compared to last year’s quarter when it made a net gain. Early signs of reignited e-commerce growth. Although Alibaba is still grappling with cautious consumers in China amid the economic slowdown, its core e-commerce business has improved due to its focus on low-cost goods. Taobao and Tmall division that represent its e-commerce segment reported 4% YoY growth to 93.2 billion yuan, accelerating from previous quarter’s 2% growth. Customer management revenue which consists of sales received from services such as marketing that merchants get from Alibaba, reported 5% YoY growth, also improving from being flat in the previous quarter. International commerce business grew 45% YoY 27.4 billion yuan. Cloud growth fails to impress, but AI rose to the task. The cloud computing division is having a hard time to shine. Last year, Alibaba decided not proceed with the spinoff of the division that competes with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) AWS and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL)-owned Google Cloud. For the reported quarter, Cloud computing brought in 25.6 billion yuan to the revenue table, posting the same growth rate of 3% YoY from the previous quarter. However, AI-related revenue reported a triple-digit YoY growth. AI-revenue came from various sectors, including foundational model companies, internet companies, financial services and the automotive industry. On Monday, Microsoft-backed OpenAI launched its new AI model, GPT-4o. Through a livestreamed event, Microsoft-backed OpenAI demonstrated its latest effort of expanding the use of its chatbot and improving its capabilities as it made a significant step when it comes to ease of use. Microsoft-backed Open AI demonstrated the capabilities of the new model that is able to even perceive the user’s emotion, help calm a user down before making a public speech as well as read a story in a different tone or even sing it. OpenAI also touted the fact the new model can act as a translator even in audio mode. Moreover, by solving math equations and helping to write codes, GPT-4o  is a strong contender to Microsoft-made GitHub Copilot. All in all, Alibaba did report its profit plummeted, but its core business as well as the promising AI segment are growing, both of which are the main heroes of its storyline and future prospects.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/tanking-profit-overshadowed-alibabas-ai-150516272.html,MSFT
"Workers heading back to the office on Mondays, caterer Compass says",15/5/2024 12:18,Yadarisa Shabong15 May 2024 at 5:18 am·1-min read,"By Yadarisa Shabong May 15 (Reuters) - Mondays are now as busy as Thursdays in office canteens in the United States and Britain, the world's largest food catering firm Compass Group said on Wednesday. Compass, which caters to staff at companies such as Microsoft and Shell, raised its annual profit forecast on Wednesday after its half-year ended March benefited from more workers returning to offices. Many global companies including Microsoft, Amazon and Apple have hybrid working policies where employees are required to be in the office for part of the working week. Companies are trying to lure back staff using incentives such as free or subsidised food after the COVID-19 pandemic dramatically changed the way people worked. Initially, workers had been reluctant to return to the office on days either side of the weekend. But Mondays have become busier across all markets and particularly in Britain and the United States, a Compass spokesperson said. Cost-conscious workers are also spending more in office canteens rather than in high street restaurants, where prices have risen sharply. That has compensated for a decline in overall footfall, CEO Dominic Blakemore told analysts. Fridays remain the quietest day of the week in terms of footfall, although that day has the highest average transaction spend based on fewer people, the spokesperson added.

5 Most Powerful Countries in the World by Economy,14/5/2024 17:56,Talha Qureshi14 May 2024 at 10:56 am·6-min read,"In this article, we will look at the 5 Most Powerful Countries in the World by Economy. The United States of America, China, and Germany are some of the most powerful countries in the world by economy. Factors including strong GDP growth, low inflation rates, increased employment opportunities, and strong investment determine a country’s economic power. In addition to these factors, the overall world economic outlook also contributes to the economic performance of these countries. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) April 2024 update, the world economy grew at 3.2% in 2023 and is forecasted to continue growing at the same rate in 2024 and 2025. The advanced economies of the world are expected to witness a slight increase in growth rate and are forecasted to grow at 1.7% in 2024 as compared to a 1.6% growth rate in 2023. On the other hand, growth for emerging and developing economies is expected to slow down modestly from 4.3% in 2023 to 4.2% in 2024. Global headline inflation is easing and was close to the pre-pandemic level in late 2023 for most economies. During the last quarter of 2023, headline inflation was recorded to be 2.3% down from 9.5% in the second quarter of 2022 in a quarter-wise analysis. While headline inflation for emerging and developing countries has also cooled down from its peak of 13.7% in the first quarter of 2022, it is still considerably high and was recorded at 9.9% in the last quarter of 2023. The mean inflation rate for developing countries is high due to uncontrolled inflation in some countries. For instance, on May 3rd, Reuters reported that annual consumer price inflation in Turkey climbed up by 69.8% in April, the rise was still below expectations, however, it was the highest since late 2022. The Finance Minister of Turkey, Mehmet Simsek, said that though inflation will peak in May, it will start to ease sharply to be in line with the government's prediction.

The announcements are part of Google’s broader effort to reestablish itself as Silicon Valley’s AI leader after it was caught off guard by Microsoft’s (MSFT) partnership with OpenAI in 2022. The new products also come a day after OpenAI unveiled its GPT-4o AI model and days before rivals Microsoft and Apple (AAPL) debut their own major generative AI updates. The biggest announcement is that Google is updating its Search platform to include generative AI results at the top of the screen. The feature, which was originally available as part of a preview in the company's Search Labs, is now coming to all US users and rolling out globally in the coming future. Another one of the biggest announcements was a new, personalized AI assistant called Gemini Live. The feature, powered by the company’s Gemini 1.5 Pro model, will allow you to speak directly to the assistant on your mobile device, providing you with responses in a number of natural-sounding voices. On the Android front, Google says it's expanding the assistant to interact with apps like Google Messages and Gmail, allowing users, for example, to drag and drop generated images from Gemini into texts and emails. Users can also use the app to ask specific questions about YouTube videos, and it will scour the video's captions to find an answer. Google is also updating its on-device version of Gemini, called Gemini Nano, with new multimodal features. Multimodal means that a generative AI model can work across mediums including text, images, and video. Google’s vice president of engineering for Gemini experiences, Amar Subramanya, told Yahoo Finance he’s been using Gemini Live for brainstorming, bouncing ideas off of the assistant. Subramanya said early testers have also been using Gemini Live for scenarios including translation. In the coming months, Google says Gemini Live will be able to access a user's cameras, allowing the assistant to interact with the real world and things it sees. OpenAI has also shown off these capabilities in demos of its GPT-4o. In one example, Subramanya said he asked the assistant to find a recipe for a pineapple upside-down cake for 15 people and add the ingredients to his Keep shopping list. The assistant found a recipe for eight people, scaled the proportions from eight to 15 people, and put the items Subramanya needed to put it together into his shopping list.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/google-debuts-a-slew-of-generative-ai-features-as-fight-with-rivals-openai-microsoft-and-apple-heats-up-175635303.html,MSFT

The announcement, as part of Google’s I/O developer conference, brings a new look to Search via its AI Overview. The feature provides a brief, AI-generated answer to searches, coupled with a series of links to the sources cited in the response. Google is also working on answering more complex answers via an update in Search Labs — which offers users the ability to test upcoming capabilities. The company says you'll be able to search for a yoga or Pilates studio in Boston that offers discounts to new members and how far it is from Beacon Hill, and Search will provide an answer without you having to perform multiple searches. It will also allow you to do things like look for meal plans for a group or put together a vacation itinerary. There is also a new video search option coming to Search Labs, which enables users to take a video and use it as a search prompt. In one example, the company says a user dealing with a problem related to a record player arm would be able to take a video of the issue, and Search would be able to provide an AI Overview explanation of the malfunction and how to address it.

Fernandez writes that Microsoft’s “human-centered approach,” based on the company’s responsible AI tenants, has been key; those include accountability, inclusiveness, reliability and safety, fairness, transparency, and privacy and security. “The principles have guided every decision our HR team has made related to the implementation of first- and third-party AI solutions,” he writes. He also highlights that HR workers don’t need computer engineering degrees to be key players in the AI metamorphosis of corporate America. “The adoption and transformation journey I and my team have been on proves you need not be a technologist to drive material digital transformation and AI adoption in your organization,” he writes. To that end, Microsoft trained and empowered HR employees to become “citizen developers” for their own AI needs via a platform that did not require advanced coding skills. That allowed Microsoft HR workers to build their own AI applications and custom tools to transform operations and automate tedious processes. One such creation was the HR Virtual Agent, an AI-powered HR bot that answered routine employee questions about benefits and workplace issues, and led to a productivity gain of around 160,000 hours for HR service advisors. In another instance, HR workers built upon an existing generative AI product to create the Copilot in Dynamics 365 Customer Service AI application, a case management tool which was rolled out to the company’s global HR service centers this year. It has led to a 26% faster response rate to initial HR inquiries, and a 7% reduction in case resolution time. Fernandez writes that the company’s workers overall have had higher job satisfaction and an optimized employee experience because of HR’s foray into AI. HR workers using Copilot Dynamics 365 Customer Service were 16% more likely to say they enjoyed their job. And looking forward, Microsoft will continue to leverage AI in the HR function. “Jobs will change and evolve with AI, as has been the case with all technological advancements in history,” he writes. “We cannot predict what the future holds, but we can be the ones to shape our future with AI.” Emma Burleighemma.burleigh@fortune.com",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-investing-billions-ai-using-122512702.html,MSFT
"The Gates Foundation is losing its smarter half, Warren Buffett says",14/5/2024 11:59,"Samantha Delouya, CNN14 May 2024 at 4:59 am·4-min read","On Monday, Melinda French Gates announced her resignation from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, officially ending one of the world’s leading philanthropic partnerships. If you ask Warren Buffett, the foundation is losing its smarter half. In a 2008 Fortune profile, the Berkshire Hathaway CEO said French Gates helped focus the foundation’s mission. “He’s smart as hell, obviously,” Buffett said of Microsoft cofounder and former CEO Bill Gates. “But in terms of seeing the whole picture, she’s smarter,” referring to French Gates. French Gates’ departure marks the end of an era for the 24-year-old foundation, which she cofounded with her ex-husband, Bill Gates “This is not a decision I came to lightly,” French Gates said in a statement on social media, announcing that her last day of work would be June 7. Since its founding in 2000, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has grown into one of the world’s largest private charitable organizations, paying out a total of $77.6 billion in grants through the end of 2023. In her departure announcement, French Gates said she plans to continue her philanthropic work independently, focusing on issues affecting women and girls in the United States and around the world. Here’s how she became one of the world’s preeminent philanthropists. French Gates started her career at Microsoft, where she was hired after graduating from Duke University, according to a 2008 profile in Fortune Magazine. She began her philanthropic life in 1997, one year after she left her job at Microsoft, cofounding the Gates Library Foundation with her then-husband, Bill Gates. The foundation’s mission was to help US public libraries offer free internet access, according to the Bill and Melinda Gates’ Foundation’s website. That foundation was a precursor to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which officially launched in 2000 with a focus on global health, science and education. The foundation has launched funds to fight diseases such as AIDS, polio and malaria, fight malnutrition and help women gain access to contraceptives, according to the foundation’s website.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/melinda-french-gates-became-one-095759042.html,MSFT
"With 73% ownership of the shares, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is heavily dominated by institutional owners",14/5/2024 11:00,editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St)14 May 2024 at 4:00 am·4-min read,"Given the large stake in the stock by institutions, Microsoft's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions A total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 44% ownership  Insiders have sold recently  If you want to know who really controls Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 73% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company. Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute. In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Microsoft.  Check out our latest analysis for Microsoft  Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing. We can see that Microsoft does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Microsoft, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Microsoft. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.0% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.3% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.0% of the company stock.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/73-ownership-shares-microsoft-corporation-110021747.html,MSFT

Melinda and Bill Gates divorced in May 2021, following nearly 30 years of marriage. But French Gates had continued to support the foundation and its work, even after the divorce. French Gates did not provide any reason for her resignation on Monday, saying only that ""the time is right for me to move forward into the next chapter of my philanthropy."" But the possibility of a split had been hinted three years ago. After the Gates’ divorce in 2021, the Foundation had publicly said that French Gates would resign as co-chair and trustee if, after two years, either of them decided “that they cannot continue to work together.” The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation did not respond to an immediate request for comment.

Microsoft pledges $4.3 billion investment at Macron’s ‘Choose France’ summit,13/5/2024 13:17,Associated Press Finance13 May 2024 at 6:17 am·2-min read,"PARIS (AP) — Microsoft announced its most substantial commitment yet to France, pledging on Monday to invest 4 billion euros ($4.3 billion) this year to bolster the country’s burgeoning artificial intelligence sector. The move is part of a broader effort unveiled during President Emmanuel Macron’s pro-business event, Choose France, which aims to attract foreign investment and stimulate economic growth. Microsoft’s vice chair and president, Brad Smith, visited the company’s French headquarters with Macron. “We will build out the computing capacity here in France,"" Smith said. ""We will put this infrastructure to work for everyone in France.” The plan includes expanding next-generation Cloud and AI infrastructure and delivering up to 25,000 of the most advanced GPUs, or graphics processing units, to France by the end of 2025. Additionally, Microsoft will launch an AI skilling initiative to train 1 million French people by the end of 2027, emphasizing the importance of equipping citizens with future-ready skills. The announcement was made as part of the annual Choose France summit, created by Macron in 2018. The summit, held this year at the Palace of Versailles, was attended by 180 international CEOs and senior business executives. It highlighted foreign investments totaling a reported 15 billion euros, surpassing last year’s 13 billion euros raised through 28 projects. Macron addressed the necessity of advancing AI technology in Europe and told Microsoft staff, “We are entering a totally different world where the competition will be ferocious, and we can only win this competition if we have trusted partners, and you are among them.” This significant investment underscores Microsoft’s commitment to supporting French growth in the AI economy and marks a milestone in the ongoing efforts to enhance France’s position as a global leader in technology and innovation.

Investors Heavily Search Microsoft Corporation (MSFT): Here is What You Need to Know,13/5/2024 13:00,Zacks Equity Research13 May 2024 at 6:00 am·5-min read,"Microsoft (MSFT) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock. Shares of this software maker have returned -1.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.3% change. The Zacks Computer - Software industry, to which Microsoft belongs, has lost 2.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term? Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision. Revisions to Earnings Estimates Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings. We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. Microsoft is expected to post earnings of $2.89 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.2%. The consensus earnings estimate of $11.76 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +19.9%. This estimate has changed +1.3% over the last 30 days. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $13.19 indicates a change of +12.1% from what Microsoft is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%. Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Microsoft is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-microsoft-corporation-130014506.html,MSFT

Microsoft, Amazon, Morgan Stanley, Sanofi and more are planning to pump investments into their French businesses as part of President Emmanuel Macron’s “Choose France” summit on Monday. This is a serious amount to announce in one day, even for a country that typically receives substantial foreign direct investment (FDI), like France. To put it in perspective, in 2022, which was a particularly strong year, the country received $36.4 billion FDI inflow in 2022, according to the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). The Choose France event, now in its seventh year, positions France as a leading hub for global business.

We have also talked about the role of AI in hiring and jobs in general. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Jobs That Will Be in Demand in 2030. In April 2024, nearly 65,000 individuals in the US lost their jobs which is 90,000 less job cuts observed in March and a slight dip from April 2023’s 66,995 cuts. The technology sector continued to witness layoffs as Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) announced a major reduction of approximately 14,000 employees which was about 10% of its workforce. It is interesting to note that automotive sector was the sector with the highest number of job cuts last month as automakers slashed over 20,000 jobs in 2024, twice the number cut by April 2023. Of the overall job cuts, 800 were attributed to AI. Despite this, employers announced plans to hire nearly 9,802 new workers in April. However, even with the sluggish hiring trends, the unemployment rate has remained relatively stable over the past year. In March, the average duration of unemployment was 5 months, compared to 4.4 months in the same period of 2023, with the unemployment rate at 3.8%, expected to rise slightly to 3.9%. Despite concerns over job losses, the unemployment rate has not exceeded 4% in 26 consecutive months, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. To read more about unemployment, see 20 States with the Highest Unemployment Rates. Speaking of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), apart from observing thousands of job cuts, it is also opting for a hiring freeze across North America. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s job board that once had over 3,400 positions, now displays just three opportunities for its manufacturing development program. Moreover, the 2024 Annual Work Trend Index by Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and LinkedIn has confimed the growing role of AI in the global employment trends. Surveying 31,000 individuals across 31 countries, the report highlighted that employers have a preference for candidates with AI expertise over those with traditional experience. Remarkably, 71% of leaders now prioritize hiring candidates with AI skills. Given the growing invasion of AI in different sectors, there will be jobs that will disappear by 2030 like administration legal assistants. Despite the increasing demand for AI skills, there's a stark discrepancy in training initiatives. While 66% of leaders insist on AI proficiency for new hires, only 25% of firms plan to provide training in generative AI this year. This gap suggests a growing advantage for younger applicants, as employers broaden their talent search to encompass those with AI acumen beyond their organizations. Consequently, Gen Zers with AI expertise not only secure prime positions but also experience accelerated career growth as 77% of leaders intend to delegate increased responsibilities to early-career hires proficient in AI.

Content Marketing is a dynamic strategy that utilizes digital tools including text, images, videos, audio, and infographics to market content and services and retain potential audiences. According to a report by Mordor Intelligence, the global content marketing industry is expected to reach $263.09 billion in 2024. The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 14.75% during the forecasted period to reach $523.45 billion by 2029. Two of the leading factors driving growth in the industry are; the growing demand for digital transformation and online presence for business and the rise of AI-based content marketing. The global content marketing industry was revolutionized in 2022 due to the release of ChatGPT by OpenAI on November 30, 2022. ChatGPT is a large language model that uses Natural Language Processing (NPL) to produce human-like dialogue form responses to user's requests. The platform immediately gained attention and was used by over a million people during the first 5 days of its release. The number of ChatGPT users has increased drastically. According to the results from Similarweb recorded on 10th May 2024, the platform was visited by 1.8 billion people during the past 28 days. The release of ChatGPT by OpenAI led other leading technology companies to develop and release their language models. Subsequently, Gemini, Copilot, and Ernie were released by Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU), respectively. These platforms have fostered growth in the AI content creation tool market. According to a report by Future Market Insights, the AI content creation tools market was valued at $840.3 million in 2024. The market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 13.60% during the forecasted period to reach $3.01 billion by 2034.

The release of AI content generators threatened the jobs of content writers, journalists, and others associated with the industry. However, the world soon realized the limitations and potential issues linked to AI-generated content. The content generated using artificial intelligence software is redundant, based on hallucinated facts or imagined facts, spammy, and mostly plagiarized. On February 8, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) released its policy about AI-generated content stating that the appropriate use of AI or automation is not against Google’s policies, however content generated to spam and manipulate the search engine ranking is against Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) spam policy and will be penalized.

12 Best Marketing Stocks to Buy,10/5/2024 23:39,Affan Mir10 May 2024 at 4:39 pm·16-min read,"In this article, we discuss the 12 best marketing stocks to buy. To skip the detailed analysis of the industry, go directly to the 5 Best Marketing Stocks to Buy. The advertising and marketing industry is a vital component of the economy and it plays diverse roles in driving growth, nurturing innovation and creativity, and facilitating market efficiency. According to a report by Solomon Partners, the projections indicate that global advertising growth for 2024 is expected to range from 4.6% to 7.2%, nearly doubling the anticipated growth rate of 2% to 5% projected for 2023. Some of the major growth catalysts in the year for marketing and advertising companies are the Paris Olympics and the US elections. According to the report, the highest ad spending year-over-year growth is expected for out-of-home advertising at 7.2%, followed by digital ad spending at 6.3%. On the other hand, print ad spending is expected to decline by 4.6% year-over-year. In recent weeks, companies with digital advertisement segments saw a healthy rise in their ad revenues. Mega-cap tech stocks such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) beat their estimates and experienced a significant rise in their advertisement businesses. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) reported its earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, on April 24, posting an EPS of $4.71, up $0.39 from forecasts. The company’s revenue was up 27% year-over-year at $36.46 billion, ahead of estimates by $240 million. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) reported that the number of ad impressions delivered across its Family of Apps increased by 20%, compared to the previous year and the average price per ad was up 6% year-over-year. Nearly 98% of the company’s revenue comes from advertisements. At its Q1 2024 earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg made the following comments about integrating AI with its ad business: “...once our new AI services reach scale, we have a strong track record of monetizing them effectively. There are several ways to build a massive business here, including scaling business messaging, introducing ads or paid content into AI interactions, and enabling people to pay to use bigger AI models and access more compute. And on top of those, AI is already helping us improve app engagement which naturally leads to seeing more ads, and improving ads directly to deliver more value. So if the technology and products evolve in the way that we hope, each of those will unlock massive amounts of value for people and business for us over time.” Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) posted its earnings for the fiscal first quarter of 2024 on April 25 and reported an EPS of $1.89, exceeding EPS estimates by $0.38. The company's revenue was up 15.4% year-over-year at $80.54 billion. The company’s Google advertising segment reported revenues of $61.66 billion, showing an increase of over 13% year-over-year. Furthermore, YouTube ads generated a revenue of $8.09 billion, compared to $6.693 billion in the first quarter of 2023. Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) CEO, Sundar Pichai made the following comments at the company’s Q1 2024 earnings call: “We remain committed to all of this work. Finally, our monetization path. We have clear paths to AI monetization through ads and cloud, as well as subscriptions. Philip will talk more about new AI features that are helping advertisers, including bringing Gemini models into Performance Max. Our Cloud business continues to grow as we bring the best of Google AI to enterprise customers and organizations around the world. And Google One now has crossed 100 million paid subscribers. And in Q1, we introduced a new AI premium plan with Gemini Advanced. Okay, those are the six points. So now let me turn to quarterly highlights from Cloud and YouTube in a bit more detail. In Cloud, we have announced more than 1,000 new products and features over the past eight months.” While the above-mentioned companies generate most of their revenues from advertising and marketing, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is an e-commerce company. However, its ad revenue experienced the most noteworthy jump. On April 30, the company reported earnings for the fiscal first quarter of 2024. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) reported an EPS of $1.13 and beat EPS expectations by $0.30. The company's revenue surged by 12.5% year-over-year to $143.3 billion and beat Wall Street consensus by $763.92 million. The company’s advertising business brought in a revenue of $11.8 billion, up 24% year-over-year. Here is what Amazon.com, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) CEO, Andy Jassy said about its advertising business at the company’s Q1 2024 earnings call: “The strength in advertising was primarily driven by sponsored products, supported by continued improvements in relevancy and measurement capabilities for advertisers. We still see significant opportunity ahead in our sponsored products as well as areas where we’re just getting started like Prime Video ads. Prime Video ads offers brands value as we can better link the impact of streaming TV advertising to business outcomes like product sales or subscription sign-ups, whether the brands sell on Amazon or not. It’s very early for streaming TV ads but we’re encouraged by the early response. Moving to AWS. Year-over-year revenue growth accelerated to 17.2% in Q1, up from 13.2% in Q4. It’s useful to remember that year-over-year percentages are only relevant relative to the total base from which you start.” On February 28, Barclays highlighted Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) strategic focus on advertising investments and emphasized their significance in light of ongoing antitrust actions in the US and Europe, as well as the evolving landscape influenced by artificial intelligence, as reported by TheFly. The firm believes that the company’s advertising assets could potentially reach a value of $50 billion over time and can challenge Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in the advertisement segment. Barclays estimates the intrinsic worth of Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) advertising segment at $30 billion, largely propelled by platforms like LinkedIn and Bing, and anticipates a potential $20 billion surge in sales through aggressive distribution strategies. Barclays has a Buy rating on Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares with a $475 price target.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/12-best-marketing-stocks-buy-233954725.html,MSFT

Microsoft hit with $242 million US verdict in Cortana patent lawsuit,10/5/2024 21:13,Blake Brittain10 May 2024 at 2:13 pm·1-min read,"By Blake Brittain (Reuters) - Microsoft must pay patent owner IPA Technologies $242 million, a federal jury in Delaware said on Friday after determining that Microsoft's Cortana virtual-assistant software infringed an IPA patent. The jury agreed with IPA after a week-long trial that Microsoft's voice-recognition technology violates IPA's patent rights in computer-communications software. IPA is a subsidiary of patent-licensing company Wi-LAN, which is jointly owned by Canadian technology company Quarterhill and two investment firms. It bought the patent and others from SRI International's Siri Inc, which Apple acquired in 2010 and whose technology it used in its Siri virtual assistant. ""We remain confident that Microsoft never infringed on IPA's patents and will appeal,"" a Microsoft spokesperson said. Representatives for IPA and Wi-LAN did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the verdict. IPA filed the lawsuit in 2018, accusing Microsoft of infringing patents related to personal digital assistants and voice-based data navigation. The case was later narrowed to concern one IPA patent. Microsoft argued that it does not infringe and that the patent is invalid. IPA has also sued Google and Amazon over its patents. Amazon defeated IPA's lawsuit in 2021, and the Google case is still ongoing.

"With Apple entering the fight, the AI chip wars have gone nuclear",10/5/2024 15:05,Daniel Howley·Technology Editor10 May 2024 at 8:05 am·4-min read,"The artificial intelligence (AI) chip wars have officially kicked into high gear. On Tuesday, Apple (AAPL) unveiled its latest iPad Pro lineup, complete with the company’s all-new M4 chip. The processor, Apple says, features a 50% faster CPU than the prior generation Pro’s M2 chip, as well as a GPU with four times the performance of its predecessor. But Apple focused most on the M4’s neural engine, the portion of the chip dedicated to running AI applications. According to the company, the neural engine in the M4 is the company’s fastest yet, and it's more powerful than any neural processing unit available on today’s AI PCs. That might all seem like Apple puffing out its chest at the competition, and it is to a degree. But it also shows we’re entering a new era of PC marketing focused on the promise of generative AI applications running directly on our machines, rather than in the cloud. Microsoft (MSFT) is already pushing the category of AI PCs along with Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), Qualcomm (QCOM), and Nvidia (NVDA), and with Apple entering the fray, the battle over which company is the new AI champ has officially begun. The AI PC, or in the case of Apple AI iPad or AI Mac, is meant to be able to run smaller versions of the kinds of large language models that power apps like ChatGPT, Microsoft’s Copilot, and Google’s Gemini. In fact, Google (GOOG, GOOGL) already runs a version of its Gemini model called Gemini Nano on its Pixel smartphones. AI PCs are, generally, PCs that include neural processing units (NPUs), or in Apple’s case, a neural engine. These are essentially portions of a chip dedicated to powering AI applications. Intel’s Core Ultra chips, which it debuted in December, feature their own NPUs, while AMD has been showing off chips with its XDNA AI engine since May 2023. Qualcomm, for its part, has also joined the fight with its Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus chips. All of these chips should end up in Windows PCs on store shelves by the end of the year. Microsoft is already banking on AI PCs being a runaway success, going so far as to introduce a Windows keyboard button dedicated to its AI-powered Copilot software. It’s the first new keyboard button in nearly 30 years. Apple, on the other hand, has been building its neural engine into its chips since it launched its A11 processor in the iPhone X in 2017. The company has regularly touted its neural engine’s capabilities throughout the years, but the debut of the M4 chip marked the first time Apple started throwing out key performance metrics. During its press event unveiling the M4, Apple was sure to point out that it not only has been outfitting its chips with neural processing engines for years but that the M4 is capable of running 38 trillion operations per second (TOPS). TOPS is more or less a measurement of how well a chip can handle AI tasks. Qualcomm, for its part, says that its Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus chips offer 45 TOPS of performance. And according to CNET, Intel and AMD’s chips top out at 34 and 38 TOPS, respectively.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/with-apple-entering-the-fight-the-ai-chip-wars-have-gone-nuclear-150546931.html,MSFT

Kaiser suggests that the company's earnings report may be the biggest event to look forward to right now, especially for equity holders, according to the S&P 500 index. He also highlighted that if the 10-year rate was pinned at 4.75%, equities would not be largely impacted if NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) misses earnings on May 22nd. The interviewer then directs the conversation to discuss the volatility of the stock. The stock went down to $735 and $740 a couple of weeks ago, to which Kaiser emphasized how NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) poses a macro risk to the market, keeping in mind that it is priced for a significant swing of 10%. Companies like Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) went down double digitals, and big tech stocks, now stabilized, also have been down in correlation. To put NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) position into perspective, the company's earnings report and the way big and small tech companies react to it are extremely crucial to the AI space at the moment.

The announcement date, though subject to change, has not been previously reported. Bloomberg and the Information have reported that Microsoft-backed OpenAI is working on a search product to potentially compete with Alphabet's Google and with Perplexity, a well-funded AI search startup. OpenAI declined to comment before Reuters published its report on Thursday.

Employees are secretly bringing their own AI tools to work so they can keep up,10/5/2024 11:09,Sheryl Estrada10 May 2024 at 4:09 am·3-min read,"Good morning. For some time, I’ve been speaking with industry experts and CFOs about ways to implement AI in finance and how to determine a business case for generative AI. But there’s new eye-opening information for companies that haven’t yet come up with an AI plan. Microsoft's 2024 Work Trend Index, released on Wednesday in partnership with LinkedIn, finds that, in the last six months, the use of generative AI has nearly doubled, with 75% of global knowledge workers using it. (Knowledge workers are considered professionals in roles like public accountants, engineers, editors, and lawyers.) In addition, 78% of AI users are actually bringing their own AI tools to the workplace, which is coined “BYOAI.” And this action is without guidance or clearance from leadership. But, employees who are trying to keep up with a fast pace and large volumes of work are leaning on the technology. Microsoft and LinkedIn pointed out that BYOAI isn’t just implemented by Gen Z (85%). It cuts across all generations—millennials (78%), Gen X (76%), and boomers (73%). Seventy-nine percent of leaders surveyed agree their company needs to adopt AI to stay competitive. However, 59% worry about quantifying the productivity gains of AI. “While leaders agree AI is a business imperative, many believe their organization lacks a plan and vision to go from individual impact to applying AI to drive the bottom line,” according to the report. “The pressure to show immediate ROI is making leaders inert, even in the face of AI inevitability.” The findings are based on a survey of 31,000 people across 31 countries, identifying labor and hiring trends from LinkedIn, and analyzing Microsoft 365 productivity signals as well as research with Fortune 500 customers. You can read the full report here. Although many knowledge workers are eager to get the ball rolling with AI, some employees are hesitant to use the technology. I recently read an article in Harvard Business Review that speaks to this. It’s titled, “For Success with AI, Bring Everyone On Board” by David De Cremer, a professor of management and technology at Northeastern University. Cremer argues that it’s counterproductive for leaders to avoid involving rank-and-file employees in AI projects. Cremer writes: “If you want to avoid resistance from your employees when introducing AI, you must push them out of their comfort zone while ensuring that they understand why you’re doing so. They should know how you plan to take care of them during this transition. You’ll need to exercise patience because it will take time and effort for workers to become familiar with AI and see how it can help them in their jobs.” He provides suggestions on what organizations must do to develop employee-inclusive AI practices. Moving beyond experimentation with AI to business transformation is tough. But it seems to be a necessity to stay competitive. Have a good weekend.

Government and private sector researchers worry U.S. adversaries could use the models, which mine vast amounts of text and images to summarize information and generate content, to wage aggressive cyber attacks or even create potent biological weapons. Here are some threats posed by AI: DEEPFAKES AND MISINFORMATION Deepfakes - realistic yet fabricated videos created by AI algorithms trained on copious online footage - are surfacing on social media, blurring fact and fiction in the polarized world of U.S. politics. While such synthetic media has been around for several years, it's been turbocharged over the past year by a slew of new ""generative AI"" tools such as Midjourney that make it cheap and easy to create convincing deepfakes. Image creation tools powered by artificial intelligence from companies including OpenAI and Microsoft, can be used to produce photos that could promote election or voting-related disinformation, despite each having policies against creating misleading content, researchers said in a report in March. Some disinformation campaigns simply harness the ability of AI to mimic real news articles as a means of disseminating false information. While major social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube have made efforts to prohibit and remove deepfakes, their effectiveness at policing such content varies. For example, last year, a Chinese government-controlled news site using a generative AI platform pushed a previously circulated false claim that the United States was running a lab in Kazakhstan to create biological weapons for use against China, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said in its 2024 homeland threat assessment.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/explainer-risks-advanced-ai-models-025235135.html,MSFT

Government and private sector researchers worry U.S. adversaries could use the models, which mine vast amounts of text and images to summarize information and generate content, to wage aggressive cyber attacks or even create potent biological weapons. Here are some threats posed by AI: DEEPFAKES AND MISINFORMATION Deepfakes - realistic yet fabricated videos created by AI algorithms trained on copious online footage - are surfacing on social media, blurring fact and fiction in the polarized world of U.S. politics. While such synthetic media has been around for several years, it's been turbocharged over the past year by a slew of new ""generative AI"" tools such as Midjourney that make it cheap and easy to create convincing deepfakes. Image creation tools powered by artificial intelligence from companies including OpenAI and Microsoft, can be used to produce photos that could promote election or voting-related disinformation, despite each having policies against creating misleading content, researchers said in a report in March. Some disinformation campaigns simply harness the ability of AI to mimic real news articles as a means of disseminating false information. While major social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube have made efforts to prohibit and remove deepfakes, their effectiveness at policing such content varies. For example, last year, a Chinese government-controlled news site using a generative AI platform pushed a previously circulated false claim that the United States was running a lab in Kazakhstan to create biological weapons for use against China, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said in its 2024 homeland threat assessment.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/explainer-risks-advanced-ai-models-233759082.html,MSFT

Google Stares Down Largest Tech Antitrust Ruling In 2 Decades — Is AT&T-Style Breakup Next?,9/5/2024 20:21,Natan Ponieman9 May 2024 at 1:21 pm·5-min read,"Closing arguments for the largest antitrust trial to date against Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), also known as Google, wrapped up last week. Now, it's up to Judge Amit Mehta to decide on a ruling that could change the fate of the company and others in the big tech space. Mehta, of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, is expected to come up with a decision before the end of the year. The case was put forth by the Justice Department in 2020, together with attorneys general from 11 states, who are arguing that Google has engaged in anti-competitive practices in order to maintain its dominance in the internet search space. Specifically, they're looking at the billions of dollars Google pays monthly to other tech companies in order to secure its place as the default search engine in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung, LG, Motorola owned by Lenovo Group Ltd (OTC:LNVGY) and other devices as well as in browsers like Mozilla Firefox and Opera. The plaintiffs argue that this practice prevents other companies from succeeding with their own search engine products, giving Google disproportionate market share in the search engine space. Last week, court documents revealed that Google paid Apple $20 billion in 2022 to be the default search engine on Safari, the web browser used on iPhone, iPad and Mac devices. In 2021, the figure amounted to $26.3 billion when including other browsers like Firefox. Google is estimated to account for about 90% of all internet searches, widely outpacing competitors like Microsoft Corp's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Bing, Yahoo Search or DuckDuckGo, a search engine that is privately owned and focused on user privacy. The final arguments from Google's attorneys as well as DOJ lawyer David Dahlquist followed a 10-week trial between September and November 2023. Read also: Google Fights Fortnite Maker’s Play Store Changes Amid Antitrust Battle: What’s at Stake? The case, however, was three years in the making for the Justice Department.

According to sources familiar with the plans, this week, Xbox offered voluntary severance agreements to producers, quality assurance testers, and other staff at ZeniMax, which Microsoft acquired in 2020 for $7.5 billion. Additional cuts are likely across the Xbox organization, Bloomberg reports. Employees were surprised by Tuesday’s abrupt closure of three Xbox subsidiaries and the absorption of a fourth. Among those closed was Tokyo-based Tango Gameworks, known for the acclaimed action game Hi-Fi Rush, which was pitching a sequel. Xbox president Matt Booty praised Hi-Fi Rush during a town hall meeting on Wednesday. Booty mentioned that the company’s studios had been stretched too thin and that the closures aimed to reallocate resources. Booty clarified that Arkane Austin, the developer behind Prey’s shutdown, was unrelated to the poor performance of its recent multiplayer game, Redfall. Before closing, Arkane had planned to pitch a new single-player game in the Dishonored series, Bloomberg writes. Jill Braff, head of ZeniMax studios, expressed hope that the reorganization would enable a greater focus on fewer projects, given the challenge of supporting nine studios worldwide with a lean central team. Microsoft’s gaming division has grown significantly through acquisitions, including ZeniMax and Activision Blizzard, which have been worth over $76 billion combined.

OpenAI considers allowing users to create AI-generated pornography,9/5/2024 13:44,Dan Milmo Global technology editor9 May 2024 at 6:44 am·4-min read,"OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is exploring whether users should be allowed to create artificial intelligence-generated pornography and other explicit content with its products. While the company stressed its ban on deepfakes would continue to apply to the adult material, campaigners suggested the proposal undermined its mission statement to produce “safe and beneficial” AI. OpenAI, which is also the developer of the DALL-E image generator, revealed it was considering letting developers and users “responsibly” create what it termed not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content through its products. OpenAI said this could include “erotica, extreme gore, slurs, and unsolicited profanity”. It said: “We’re exploring whether we can responsibly provide the ability to generate NSFW content in age-appropriate contexts … We look forward to better understanding user and societal expectations of model behaviour in this area.” The proposal was published as part of an OpenAI document discussing how it develops its AI tools. Joanne Jang, an employee at the San Francisco-based company who worked on the document, told the US news organisation NPR that OpenAI wanted to start a discussion about whether the generation of erotic text and nude images should always be banned from its products. However, she stressed that deepfakes would not be allowed. “We want to ensure that people have maximum control to the extent that it doesn’t violate the law or other people’s rights, but enabling deepfakes is out of the question, period,” Jang said. “This doesn’t mean that we are trying now to create AI porn.” However, she conceded that whether the output was considered pornography “depends on your definition”, adding: “These are the exact conversations we want to have.” Jang said there were “creative cases in which content involving sexuality or nudity is important to our users”, but this would be explored in an “age-appropriate context”.

25 States Where Everyday Americans Earn the Lowest Incomes,9/5/2024 13:11,Afifa Mushtaque9 May 2024 at 6:11 am·10-min read,"In this article, we will look at the 25 states where everyday Americans earn the lowest incomes. We have also discussed the state of salaries in the US. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 10 States where Everyday Americans Earn the Lowest Incomes. As of 2024, salaries for new roles in the US have not only been stagnant but, in some cases, have been even decreasing. Reports indicate that 48% of surveyed US companies have lowered pay for certain positions. It is concerning to note that the job market in the US has been fluctuating since the onset of the pandemic. Employers initially offered high salaries to attract talent as there was an increase in open roles. However, as economic uncertainties persisted and companies scaled back hiring efforts, the demand for workers diminished. Sectors that once experienced high demand for workers, such as hospitality, retail, and technology, are now witnessing a reset in compensation expectations due to an oversupply of labor. To read more about industries and quit rates, see the Industries with the Highest Number of Quits in the US. While salaries have been disappointing overall in the US, average salaries by profession can also vary in different states. Massachusetts has surprisingly become the state with the highest median annual salary of about $60,690, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics salary data. The number has surpassed the expectations that one might have for New York City or Silicon Valley. However, these high wages often come hand in hand with a higher cost of living, with Hawaii being the only state, apart from the District of Columbia, where living costs are higher than those of Massachusetts. In fact, Hawaii is also considered one of the states that make the most money for the US. On the other hand, Mississippi is one of the states with the lowest average salaries in the US. to read more about average salaries by state, see Average Salary in Each State in US. There is no question about why salaries are one of the biggest sources for motivation for employees at work as salaries are crucial for maintaining a decent quality of life, especially considering the varying costs of living across different cities in the US. In major US cities like New York, San Jose, and Boston, the cost of living is significantly higher which makes it crucial to earn enough to cover basic expenses comfortably. For instance, in New York City, a single individual needs approximately $138,570 annually to live comfortably, while a family with two adults and two children requires around $318,406. Similarly, San Jose requires $136,739 for an individual and $334,547 for a family in similar circumstances. Despite these concerning numbers that make high salaries look like the ultimate determinant for an average American employee, in a recent survey, 77% of respondents across 16 countries, including the United States, confirmed their personal preference for the importance of a balanced life over career growth. This trend is particularly pronounced among younger generations as 60% of millennials and 56% of Gen Z adults are willing to trade a 20% pay cut for a better work-life balance. Conversely, older demographics show less inclination, with only 45% of Gen Xers and 33% of Baby Boomers willing to make such a sacrifice. Nevertheless, Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) has recently announced a major boost in annual salaries for its US store managers, effective February 1st. The decision sees the average salary and bonus for these managers rise to $128,000 annually, up from $117,000 previously. Additionally, the revamped bonus structure will offer the potential for bonuses of up to 200% of base salary, contingent on store performance and achieved targets. Moreover, Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) also did not let its frontline hourly associates down as they raised their average hourly pay to over $18, up from $17.50 announced in the prior year. This increment goes hand in hand with Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT)’s ongoing efforts to retain employees and enhance its competitive edge in the tight labor market. With approximately 1.6 million associates in the United States, Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT)’s investment in its workforce confirm that they have a proactive approach to sustaining growth and ensuring employee satisfaction. On the other hand, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s CEO Satya Nadella has announced plans to resume performance-based raises for certain employees after a year of stagnant salaries. This decision is following internal discontentment over compensation and aims to address employee concerns. Despite Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s $3 trillion valuation, employee satisfaction has been an ongoing issue that has prompted actions like the 2022 across-the-board compensation raise and, more recently, an increase in stock awards to retain talent. Moreover, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s recent $3.3 billion investment in Wisconsin will involve the expansion of cloud computing and AI infrastructure and is expected to create approximately 2,300 union construction jobs by 2025. Moreover, the establishment of a Data Center Academy in collaboration with Gateway Technical College will train over 1,000 students to meet the demands of the burgeoning IT sector which will further enhance job prospects in the area. 25 Poorest States in the US in 2024",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/25-states-where-everyday-americans-131146174.html,MSFT

But China in the past year has built its own domestic generative AI industry and has been urging its companies to avoid foreign technology. Here is how reliant China currently is on U.S. AI models and the impact Washington's plans may have: HOW ACCESSIBLE ARE OPENAI’S AI MODELS IN CHINA? OpenAI’s key AI services such as ChatGPT and the DALL-E image generator have not been officially rolled out in mainland China. An OpenAI spokesperson told Reuters last year that it was unable to do so in certain countries due to local ""conditions"". However, a large number of companies and engineers have accessed OpenAI’s services using proxy tools like virtual private networks (VPN) to mask their network addresses. As such, many Chinese companies have been able to build software and applications on top of OpenAI’s models. Chinese companies also frequently benchmark their own AI models against those of OpenAI. OpenAI has shut down Chinese companies’ access to its service. Last December, OpenAI suspended the account of ByteDance, TikTok’s Chinese owner, after technology website The Verge reported that ByteDance used OpenAI’s technology to develop its own AI. In Hong Kong, China’s special administrative region, access to OpenAI’s AI models is also restricted but it is not airtight. Although OpenAI’s services are unavailable there, Microsoft , an investor and a partner of OpenAI, has released Copilot, a generative AI service built with OpenAI’s latest technology, to the public.

Apple’s iPad event was an AI teaser for its future,9/5/2024 9:22,Daniel Howley·Technology Editor9 May 2024 at 2:22 am·3-min read,"Apple’s (AAPL) artificial intelligence push has begun. On Tuesday, the company unveiled its latest iPad Pros, which pack an all-new M4 processor. The chip provides the Pro with a number of benefits including a faster CPU and updated graphics processing unit. But it was Apple’s focus on the M4’s AI capabilities that stood out the most. Apple has been putting its neural engine into processors since 2017 and has previously talked up how it helps power a number of iPhone, iPad, and Mac features for some time. But the M4 unveiling was different, serving as an appetizer for the AI features the company will present at its WWDC event in June, when Apple is widely expected to debut a slew of generative AI-powered software features for its various devices. Apple pointed to a number of the M4’s AI bona fides during the keynote, with vice president of platform architecture Tim Millet specifically noting that the chip is capable of 34 trillion operations per second, a measurement commonly used when describing a chip’s AI performance. Millet also said that the M4’s neural engine is more powerful than any neural processing unit in any AI PC. That’s a direct shot at Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), and Qualcomm (QCOM), which are preparing to or are already rolling out their own AI PC chips designed to run large language models on Windows laptops and desktops. Outside of the M4’s AI processing fundamentals, Apple was mum on any substantive discussion of AI software updates. Sure, Millet said that the M4 helps the iPad Pro quickly isolate a subject from its background in a 4K video, but the M2-equipped iPad Air can do the same thing, just a bit slower. All the company had to offer was that the M4 would make AI apps and features run faster and more smoothly. The company also didn’t provide information about the M4’s performance while training or running large language models (LLMs), something that Intel, Qualcomm, and AMD regularly point to as indicators of their chips’ strengths. Still, the fact that Apple gave consumers, and Wall Street, an early look at its AI thinking is important. The company is widely viewed as behind the curve when it comes to the generative AI race, and investors are banking heavily on WWDC serving as Apple’s big AI coming-out party. CEO Tim Cook has been steadily mentioning AI more over the past few months and said during the company’s most recent earnings call that the iPhone maker is investing heavily in the technology.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/apples-ipad-event-was-an-ai-teaser-for-its-future-184058075.html,MSFT

Biden makes a Wisconsin stop to tout AI — and troll Trump's Foxconn flop,8/5/2024 18:07,Ben Werschkul·Washington Correspondent8 May 2024 at 11:07 am·4-min read,"President Biden made a trip to the swing state of Wisconsin on Wednesday with two goals. First, he was there to formally unveil a new $3.3 billion investment by Microsoft in artificial intelligence in the state. But a second clear priority was to highlight the failure of one of Donald Trump’s biggest jobs promises from his time in office. Microsoft’s (MSFT) forthcoming AI data center — as Biden was more than happy to point out repeatedly — is being built on land that was cleared during the Trump administration for a planned $10 billion Foxconn investment. The land was then abandoned when the Foxconn project was scaled way back. Trump talked a lot about infrastructure and jobs but ""didn’t build a damn thing,"" Biden said as he took the stage Wednesday afternoon, adding: ""Foxconn turned out to be just that, a con."" ""On my watch, we make promises and we keep promises,"" he added later, just in case anyone missed the message.

The news comes six years after the Trump administration announced a $10 billion investment by tech manufacturer Foxconn – with the promise to bring 13,000 jobs to the area – on the same Wisconsin land, a plan that never materialized. The new center aims to create 2,300 union construction jobs and 2,000 permanent jobs over time, according to Microsoft. Microsoft said it will use the center to train about 100,000 workers across the state on generative AI by 2030, thanks in part to a partnership with United Way Wisconsin, United Way Racine and other community partners.

It has facilities in 205 locations across 24 countries. “Employment at Foxconn Wisconsin has grown at least 42% in the three years since 2020,” the company said. “We have been Racine County’s largest taxpayer in recent years.”",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-build-ai-hub-previously-093128546.html,MSFT
12 Best Gig Economy Stocks To Buy,8/5/2024 17:07,Affan Mir8 May 2024 at 10:07 am·16-min read,"In this article, we discuss the 12 best gig economy stocks to buy. To skip the detailed analysis of the gig economy market, go directly to the 5 Best Gig Economy Stocks To Buy. The gig economy refers to a labor market characterized by short-term, freelance, or independent contractor positions, where individuals are hired on a temporary or flexible basis to complete specific tasks or projects. Gig workers are independent contractors who typically find work through online platforms or apps that connect them with clients or customers who are looking for various kinds of services such as coding, writing, and graphic designing, among others. The COVID-19 pandemic was one of the main growth catalysts for gig workers and the number of these independent contractors is rising rapidly. According to a report by MBO Partners, 45% of the US American workforce worked as independent contractors in 2023. Between 2020 and 2023, the number of independent workers grew by 89%. The report states that 40% of the gig workers said that they used online platforms to find work over the last 12 months and 47% are planning to use them over the next 12 months. According to Business Research Insights, the global gig economy market was valued at $14.75 billion in 2021. It is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20% between 2023 and 2031, reaching $92.9 billion at the end of the forecasted period. A report by the gig economy company, Upwork Inc. (NASDAQ:UPWK), posted in October 2023, revealed that Gen Z and millennials are the top earners in the gig economy with 45% of the former and 44% of the latter group making at least $2,500 a month from the platform. Moreover, as of 2022, North American and Western European citizens have the highest average freelance rates at $44 and $31 per hour, respectively. It is followed by South America at $24 per hour and Central America, Asia, Africa, and Central and Eastern Europe are all tied at $22 per hour. On February 16, MoffettNathanson’s senior research analyst, Michael Morton told CNBC that the last 12 months have been quite positive for the gig economy stocks. He said that initially, the industry was considered a weak domain by investors because it consumed $125 billion of investor capital between 2015 and 2022 while being focused on expanding market share rather than increasing profitability. However, over the last year, companies like Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) and DoorDash, Inc. (NASDAQ:DASH) have experienced a “profitability explosion” due to their corporate decisions. Morton added that according to his firm, the total addressable market for the gig economy industry is around $4 trillion. He noted that grocery delivery is a trillion-dollar market that is “underpenetrated”, and there is a chance that Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) and DoorDash, Inc. (NASDAQ:DASH) could also capture a noteworthy share of this market very soon. Micheal Morton mentioned that he has heard people refer to Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) and DoorDash, Inc. (NASDAQ:DASH) as “undeletable apps” and noted several growth prospects for these companies. They are some of the biggest gig economy companies in the world. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) posted its FY23 earnings on February 7, reporting that its gross bookings were up 19% year-over-over, and it generated a revenue of $37.28 billion, up 17% year-over-year. The company reported a net income of $1.887 billion, compared to a net loss of $9.14 billion in FY22. While Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) seems to have a promising future, it faced several headwinds in the first quarter of 2024 due to which its earnings and revenues declined slightly. It reported its Q1 earnings on May 8 with a loss per share of $0.32. Nevertheless, the company’s revenue was up 15%  year-over-year at $10.1 billion, and income from operations was $172 million, up $434 million from Q1 2023. The company reached an adjusted EBITDA of $1.4 billion, up 82% year-over-year, marking a new quarterly record for Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER). The company also generated a free cash flow of $4.2 billion over the trailing twelve months. The company’s CFO, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah, made the following remarks: “Q1 marked another strong quarter for Uber. Gross Bookings growth remained consistent at 21% YoY on a constant-currency basis (22% excluding Freight), as we generated Gross Bookings of $37.7 billion. We landed just shy of our guidance midpoint, with softer Mobility activity in LatAm as we lapped heightened demand during Carnival last year, coupled with the impact of holidays shifting into Q1 of this year. Foreign exchange was a headwind of roughly $205 million YoY or roughly 70 bps. We grew our revenue by 15% YoY on a constant-currency basis to $10.1 billion, which includes a 8 percentage point YoY headwind related to business model changes. As a reminder, certain business model changes, which have no impact on profitability, negatively impacted revenue reporting by $742 million. We expect to lap the majority of these business model changes in the second half of this year. We converted this strong top-line growth into solid profitability, with all-time high Adjusted EBITDA of $1.4 billion, up 82% YoY, and a record Adjusted EBITDA margin of 3.7% of Gross Bookings, an increase of 130 bps YoY. We intentionally held back some of our in-market Mobility investments with lower ROI as Q1 is typically a lighter quarter due to seasonal Mobility rider behaviors. We remain focused on striking the right balance between growth and profitability, and running Uber to deliver on the 3-year financial framework we set in February.” On February 15, DoorDash, Inc. (NASDAQ:DASH) reported a net loss attributed to the company and shareholders of $558 million for FY23, compared to a net loss of $1.365 billion in FY22. The company generated a revenue of $8.6 billion in 2023, compared to $6.58 billion in 2022. It announced its first quarter 2024 earnings on May 1, reporting an EPS of -$0.06. The company’s GAAP net loss including redeemable non-controlling interests was $25 million, down from $162 million in Q1 2023. The revenue for the quarter was $2.51 billion, up 23% year-over-year, which outperformed the analyst estimates by $60 million.

"Gen Zers could swipe millennials’ jobs if they have AI skills, LinkedIn and Microsoft data shows",8/5/2024 12:00,"Orianna Rosa Royle, Jane Thier8 May 2024 at 5:00 am·3-min read","Millennials, who weathered the 2008 financial crisis, face further challenges as they contend with job market shifts. Their traditional career trajectories are being reshaped by digital-savvy Gen Zers armed with AI expertise, according to the 2024 Annual Work Trend Index by Microsoft and LinkedIn. Surveying 31,000 individuals across 31 nations, the tech titans reveal a shift in employer preferences: ""Managers say AI aptitude could rival experience."" Significantly, 71% of leaders preferred hiring candidates with AI skills over those with more conventional experience. Compounding the issue, employers show little inclination to train existing staff in AI. Despite 66% of leaders insisting on AI skills for new hires, a mere 25% of firms plan to provide training in generative AI this year. This trend implies a burgeoning advantage for younger applicants, as employers must cast a wider net for talent beyond their organizations. Furthermore, Gen Zers with AI acumen not only stand to secure prime positions but also accelerate their ascent up the corporate ladder. The report reveals that 77% of leaders intend to delegate increased responsibilities to early-career hires with AI proficiencies. Karin Kimbrough, LinkedIn’s chief economist, tells Fortune that employees—not their bosses—are driving the push to integrate AI into their jobs.  That includes entry-level employees, like Gen Zers, who are still gaining their career footing. “AI is at work; employees are not waiting for their employers to set up official business processes to use it,” she said. “They’re already experimenting, learning, and trying it out, because they see the value proposition.” In the report, Microsoft and LinkedIn call those particularly AI-inclined workers “power users,” because they’re the most adept at finding ways to use AI to save time and improve their own performance—and while younger workers historically skew more pro-tech, the report finds that power user employees aren’t limited to one generation.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/gen-zers-could-swipe-millennials-120000162.html,MSFT
Workers are eyeing the exit in 2024 as LinkedIn and Microsoft study warns more people want to quit their jobs now than during the Great Resignation,8/5/2024 12:00,Orianna Rosa Royle8 May 2024 at 5:00 am·3-min read,"The cost of living has spiraled, the threat of layoffs (thanks to AI and overhiring) looms, and flexible working arrangements won before bosses started issuing return-to-office mandates are now like gold dust. That's why, after three years of workers quitting their jobs at a record pace—about 47 million Americans left their jobs in 2021 alone—experts have reassured employers that 2024 will be the year of the “Great Stay”. Even the professor who coined the term “Great Resignation” predicted that it would fizzle out by New Year's Eve 2023. However, new data from LinkedIn and Microsoft shows that they might have been overly optimistic. The two tech giants surveyed 31,000 individuals across 31 countries and found that the percentage of people (46%) who want to quit their jobs in the year ahead is actually higher than in 2021 (40%). Adding to the alarm, American employers are in for a rough ride: Around 85% of professionals in the U.S. are eyeing up a new job this year. Meanwhile, LinkedIn has already witnessed a 14% surge in job applications per role since the fall. Although previous reports have suggested that bosses are back in charge—and using their renewed power to claw back employee-first initiatives like working from home—LinkedIn and Microsoft’s report reveals that they shouldn't get too cozy just yet. And they know it. Nine out of 10 organizations globally are concerned about employee retention, and half of the hiring managers in Europe predict an increase in employee turnover in 2024. This means that keeping workers happy might just climb back to the top of managers' to-do lists. LinkedIn and Microsoft told Fortune that three reasons behind the sudden uptick in workers eyeing up the exit were burnout, a lack of learning opportunities, and artificial intelligence. LinkedIn’s Workforce Confidence Index found that 59% of U.S. employees who are actively job-seeking agree that they feel stuck in their job (vs. 35% of those who are not job-seeking) and 51% feel burnt out from their job (vs 37%). Likewise, Microsoft’s Work Trend Index echoed that 68% of people globally struggle with the pace and volume of work and 46% feel burned out.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/workers-eyeing-exit-2024-linkedin-120000835.html,MSFT
Biden lauds new Microsoft center on the same site where Trump's Foxconn project failed,8/5/2024 22:36,COLLEEN LONG and SEUNG MIN KIMUpdated 8 May 2024 at 3:36 pm·6-min read,"STURTEVANT, Wisc. (AP) — President Joe Biden on Wednesday laced into Donald Trump over a failed project in the previous administration that was supposed to bring thousands of new jobs into southeastern Wisconsin and trumpeted new economic investments under his watch that are coming to the same spot. That location in the battleground state will now be the site of a new data center from Microsoft, whose president credited the Biden administration's economic policies for paving the way for the new investments. For Biden, it offered another point of contrast between him and Trump, who had promised a $10 billion investment by the Taiwan-based electronics giant Foxconn that never came. “In fact, he came here with your senator, Ron Johnson, literally holding a golden shovel, promising to build the eighth wonder of the world. You kidding me?” Biden told the crowd of about 300 people, who clapped and cheered loudly as he spoke. “Look what happened. They dug a hole with those golden shovels, and then they fell into it.” Noting that 100 homes were destroyed to make way for the project, which wasted hundreds of millions of dollars, Biden added a jab: “Foxconn turned out to be just that — a con. Go figure.” Biden was in Sturtevant, in Racine County, to promote the $3.3 billion Microsoft data center, which the Democratic president said will employ about 2,300 union construction workers to build it and then 2,000 permanent employees to staff it. Microsoft’s president Brad Smith said in an interview with The Associated Press that Microsoft had a “steadfast commitment to under-promising and over-delivering” and praised the Biden administration and the state’s Democratic governor, Tony Evers, for economic policies that set the stage for the developments announced Wednesday. But Biden was eager to take the credit and use the opportunity to repeatedly take swings at Trump, arguing that his presumptive Republican challenger embraced the same type of “trickle-down economics” that Biden abhors and failed to revive domestic manufacturing during his four years in the White House. “Folks, during the previous administration, my predecessor made promises, which he broke more than kept, left a lot of people behind in communities like Racine,” Biden said. “On my watch, we make promises, and we keep promises."" Trump's campaign didn't address Foxconn, but the Republican former president often says the economy was in a much better position when he was in office and will be again should he win in 2024. Republican National Committee chairman Michael Whatley said Biden's trip was an attempt to “save face in Racine County as Wisconsinites feel the pain of Bidenomics.” “Manufacturing has stalled, family farms are shuttering, and costs are up for everything from electricity and gas to food and housing,” Whatley said. “It’s no wonder why Biden is losing in Wisconsin and battleground states across the country: his policies have failed and people want President Trump back in office.”",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/biden-heads-wisconsin-laud-microsoft-093913272.html,MSFT

These 3 stocks are poised to benefit from the massive energy transition,8/5/2024 8:00,Ines Ferré·Senior Business Reporter8 May 2024 at 1:00 am·3-min read,"The energy transition involves technologies ranging from renewables like solar and wind to electrical grid upgrades for increased power demand. While higher interest rates put pressure on the clean energy sector last year, surging electricity demands for everything from artificial intelligence to EV charging are expected to buoy the clean technologies industry. Incentives from the government's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) aimed at accelerating the transition to green, domestically produced technologies are also expected to lift the sector. The following are three stocks that analysts believe are well positioned to benefit from the energy transition in the US. Among renewables, First Solar has 31 Buy ratings, six Hold, and zero Sell recommendations. The Tempe, Arizona-based company is the largest supplier and domestic manufacturer of solar modules in the US, with a sales backlog extending beyond 2027. “FSLR is ahead of the curve and has established a robust domestic supply chain and manufacturing footprint, making it a large beneficiary of the IRA. As a domestic producer, FSLR is also able to limit high-cost freight and avoid tariffs and import risk,” RBC Capital’s Christopher Dendrinos recently noted. Goldman Sachs analysts are also bullish on the stock, seeing it as a beneficiary of utility scale projects' need to supply extra power for data centers and AI workloads. “Companies will likely look domestically for their panels to be able to benefit from domestic content bonus. In some cases, FSLR even partners directly with companies that own the data centers such as Microsoft (MSFT),” said Goldman Sachs analyst Carly Davenport and her team. Year to date, First Solar is up 14%. The maker of wind turbines and natural gas turbines recently spun off from GE (GE).

AI boom set to fuel data centre deals in Asia this year,8/5/2024 2:34,"Scott Murdoch, Kane Wu and Yantoultra Ngui7 May 2024 at 7:34 pm·4-min read","By Scott Murdoch, Kane Wu and Yantoultra Ngui SYDNEY/HONG KONG/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Global private equity investors and asset managers are readying for billions of dollars worth of M&A and investments linked to data centres in Asia Pacific, as the artificial intelligence (AI) boom fuels demand for digital infrastructure. The intense pace of deals in the world's most populous region comes as countries and companies respond to booming demand for AI, calling for more data capacity, industry executives said. Asia Pacific, including Japan, has led dealmaking activities in the global data centre market this year, with M&A value totalling $840.47 million, more than half of the global amount, LSEG data showed. In 2023, the region's data centre deals hit a record high of $3.45 billion, according to LSEG. That tally is set to be surpassed this year with at least a couple of large transactions in the pipeline. A number of financial sponsors, including global investment powerhouse Blackstone Inc, are looking to acquire AirTrunk, which owns 11 hyperscale data centres in Australia and the rest of the region, sources close to the transaction said. AirTrunk owners, Macquarie Group and Canada's Public Sector Pension Investment Board (PSP), are aiming to value the business at up to A$15 billion ($9.8 billion), sources said, in what could be Asia's largest data centre transaction this year. AirTrunk, Blackstone, Macquarie and PSP declined to comment. ""The AI revolution is creating an unprecedented wall of demand for high quality data centre capacity,"" said Garren Cronin, managing director of Cadence Advisory, which advised on Australian data centre operator NEXTDC's $861 million capital raising in April.

As companies are reporting their financial results for the first quarter of 2024, artificial intelligence once again appears to be one of the leitmotifs of the current earnings season. While the data for the current earnings season is unavailable, FactSet estimated that out of 179 companies that had earnings calls between December 15 and March 15, the term AI was mentioned on average 13 times. The tally of 179 marked the second highest for the term ""AI"" in the transcripts over the course of the past ten years, and was just three shy of the current record of 181 set during Q2 2023. Within that dataset, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) led the pack, as it mentioned the term AI 114 times during the company’s latest earnings call. The chip maker, known for its GPUs, has seen a significant boost in its stock price on the back of strong demand for semiconductors that power various AI applications. Its shares are up by a cool 216% since May 2023, after CEO Jensen Huang shared that he foresaw a the need for a ""trillion dollars of installed global data center infrastructure"" to transform computing from ""general purpose to accelerated."" Since then, NVIDIA's CEO, who is widely credited by the industry to have lead the development of GPU-accelerated computing applications such as medical imaging, reiterated his estimates of the AI industry. The latest on this front came in February 2024, when at the World Government Summit, Huang not only elaborated on his vision for accelerated computing but went on to stress that continued advancement of processors to fuel AI use cases will be energy efficient as well. According to him: ""So now, we're in the beginning of this new era. And what's going to happen is, there's about a trillion dollars worth of installed base of data centers around the world. And over the course four, five years, we'll have two trillion dollars worth of data centers that will be . .uh. . powering software around the world. And this architecture for accelerated computing is ideal for this next generation of software called generative AI. So that's really at the core of what is happening. While we're replacing the installed base, of, general purpose computing, remember that the performance of the architecture is going to be improving at the same time. So, you can't assume, just that you will buy more computers; you have to also assume that the computers are going to become faster. And, therefore, the total amount that you need is not going to be as much. Otherwise the mathematics that we just assumed, that computers never get any faster, you might come to the conclusion, we need fourteen different planets, and three different galaxies, and you know, four more Suns, to, to fuel all this. But obviously, computer architecture continues to advance."" All this focus on NVIDIA and AI means that its upcoming earnings release will be closely watched by investors and analysts worldwide. Another firm that once again has become the center of attention after quarter earnings is the Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp parent Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). Meta's stock had a strong run in February 2024 on the back of its fourth-quarter earnings report, which was accompanied by a surprise $0.5 quarterly dividend announcement. However, in April nearly all of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s gains were wiped out as investors looked past better-than-expected results and focused on the forward guidance that included Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s plans to spend $40 billion this year, most of which will go towards its AI initiatives. On the other hand, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) have managed to keep investor pessimism at bay, at least for now. Both companies reported their earnings a day after Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). Investors were pleased to see both Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) report robust growth in the Core segments, where artificial intelligence served as a major catalyst. Microsoft and Google's parent reported revenue and earnings above expectations and expressed optimism regarding maintaining the same momentum going forward. For Microsoft and Alphabet, the earnings from their cloud business divisions provide a glimpse into the firms' AI performance in the first quarter. Microsoft's overall results saw it beat analyst revenue and EPS estimates of $60.8 billion and $2.82, respectively, by posting revenue of $61.9 billion and earnings of $2.94 per share. Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment's sales sat at $26.7 billion, while Azure, the cloud computing platform, grew by 31%. At the earnings call, CFO Amy Wood also briefly commented on AI revenue growth by sharing that ""AI services contributed 7 points of growth as expected."" Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s first quarter earnings also highlighted AI due to strong performance by the Google Cloud segment. The company's Cloud business, which offers AI product bundles like Google One, posted $9.57 billion in revenue and marked a 28% growth on the year. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai shared details for Google Cloud's AI Hypercomputer, as he outlined that ""60% of funded Gen AI startups and nearly 90% of Gen AI unicorns are Google Cloud customers."" The executive added that business and corporate interest in AI was proceeding smoothly, with firms such as Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS) ""deploying Gen AI-driven tools to its nearly 10,000 call center agents to achieve faster resolution times for customers.""",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/12-best-artificial-intelligence-stocks-234048862.html,MSFT
US State Dept broadens security vendor list amid Microsoft hacking woes,7/5/2024 19:32,Zeba Siddiqui7 May 2024 at 12:32 pm·2-min read,"By Zeba Siddiqui SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of State has been working with a range of security vendors beyond Microsoft since China-linked hackers stole tens of thousands of the department's emails by breaching the tech giant's network last year, a senior official said. That hack, which compromised some 60,000 State Department emails, including those of Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, was one of the worst in recent years against a federal agency and triggered much criticism of Microsoft. The Cyber Safety Review Board slammed the company last month for its lack of transparency. ""It's not even that the software they gave me wasn't secure. It's that the keys to the kingdom were in the corporate network and their corporate network wasn't secure,"" Kelly Fletcher, the department's chief information officer said on the sidelines of the RSA Conference in San Francisco on Monday. ""We're seeing this sort of across the ecosystem ... that these corporate networks are really important,"" she said in an interview. ""I'm counting on all my vendors, not just Microsoft, not only to sell me software that's secure, but to have a secure corporate network."" A hacking group Microsoft calls Storm-558 had gained access to a digital key that allowed it to break into several government inboxes, the tech firm earlier said. The incident strained an already tense U.S.-China relationship as the Chinese embassy in Washington dismissed allegations that Chinese government-linked hackers were behind it. ""Microsoft is an important part of (the State Department's)ecosystem, absolutely. But they're not my only cloud vendor,"" Fletcher said, adding that the department would continue using multiple vendors. Some of them are Palo Alto, Zscaler, and Cisco, she added. Microsoft eventually revoked the hackers' access by invalidating the stolen digital key, but Fletcher said the breach could have had a much wider impact. ""At the time I did not imagine that it was actually that they could access anything they wanted in the Microsoft Office 365 environment for almost any organisation in the world, but that was in fact the case,"" she said, referring to the company's proprietary software. The department has since implemented various security measures including multifactor authentication and widening data encryption, Fletcher said.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/us-state-dept-broadens-security-193258035.html,MSFT
Are Microsoft and OpenAI becoming full-on frenemies?,7/5/2024 17:39,Sharon Goldman7 May 2024 at 10:39 am·4-min read,"Hello and welcome to Eye on AI! Microsoft and OpenAI have long had a complex, codependent relationship that always makes me want to sing Avril Lavigne (“Why’d ya have to go and make things so complicated?”). It all began with Microsoft’s $1 billion investment in OpenAI in 2019 and ramped up with its $10 billion commitment in 2023, much of which is in the form of cloud compute purchases instead of cash. In exchange, Microsoft got the right to reuse OpenAI’s models and became a minority holder specifically in the profit-making part of OpenAI’s business which, in turn, is “legally bound to pursue the Nonprofit’s mission.” That arrangement gives OpenAI some unusual powers. According to OpenAI, its nonprofit board will determine when the company has “attained AGI,” or artificial general intelligence—the point at which AI finally outperforms humans at ""economically valuable work."" Once the board decides AGI has been reached, such a system will be “excluded from IP licenses and other commercial terms with Microsoft."" Translation: Once OpenAI achieves its stated mission of reaching AGI, Microsoft will presumably not have access to or be able to profit from OpenAI's AGI-level technology. Issues around OpenAI’s nonprofit board came to a head when it suddenly fired CEO Sam Altman—and then quickly reinstated him—in November 2023. Before his ouster, Altman said he and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella were “nowhere near the frenemy territory,” saying the relationship was “really good.” But recent developments leave me wondering whether the Big Tech behemoth and the $80 billion startup are becoming full-on frenemies. After all, Nadella was blindsided by Altman’s ouster, learning of it just minutes before the rest of the world. And on a joint episode of the Pivot and On with Kara Swisher podcasts during the Altman drama, he said, “One thing, I’ll be very, very clear, is we’re never going to get back into a situation where we get surprised like this, ever again.… That’s done.” These days, Microsoft is clearly hedging its bets: Less than two months ago, Microsoft announced it was forming a new organization, called Microsoft AI, with Mustafa Suleyman, founder of DeepMind and cofounder of Inflection AI, as its CEO. Microsoft also paid $650 million for the rights to Inflection’s intellectual property. And yesterday, The Information reported that Microsoft is readying a new, massive, state-of-the-art AI model to compete with OpenAI (as well as Google and Anthropic). The new model, internally referred to as MAI-1, is being overseen by Suleyman. Meanwhile, OpenAI’s Altman appears less focused on the part of the business that benefits Microsoft, and more on the company’s relentless pursuit to reach AGI. Addressing students at Stanford University last week, he honed in on his belief that any cost in support of that mission is justified. “There is probably some more business-minded person than me at OpenAI somewhere worried about how much we’re spending, but I kinda don’t,” he said. “Whether we burn $500 million a year or $5 billion—or $50 billion a year—I don’t care, I genuinely don’t,” he continued. “As long as we can figure out a way to pay the bills, we’re making AGI. It’s going to be expensive.” Whether Microsoft will keep investing in OpenAI towards that mega-cost, ill-defined mission remains to be seen. After all, according to an internal email released last week as part of the ongoing U.S. Justice Department antitrust case against Google, Microsoft initially invested in OpenAI in 2019 because it was “very worried” that Google was years ahead in scaling up its AI efforts.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-openai-becoming-full-frenemies-173939431.html,MSFT
"Microsoft's Xbox shuts multiple studios, consolidates teams in cost-cutting move",7/5/2024 17:31,Reuters7 May 2024 at 10:31 am·1-min read,"(Reuters) - Microsoft's Xbox is shutting down a number of gaming studios including Arkane Austin, making it the latest publisher to shut down studios amid signs of a gaming slowdown. Studios such as ""Hi-Fi Rush"" maker Tango Gameworks, headquartered in Tokyo, and Canada-based Alpha Dog will also be closed and some employees will be laid off, Matt Booty, head of Xbox Game Studios said in a memo that was seen by Reuters on Tuesday. Xbox declined to comment when asked about the number of employees impacted by the layoffs. Growth in personal computing and console gaming is expected to remain below pre-pandemic levels as gamers record fewer hours of playtime owing to weaker release schedules, data from research firm Newzoo showed. The ""reprioritization of titles and resources"" is so that Xbox can invest deeply into its portfolio of games and new intellectual property, according to Booty. All the affected studios are units of ZeniMax Media, which was acquired by Microsoft for $7.5 billion in 2021, and Bethesda. Microsoft's Xbox content and services segment reported a 62% jump in third-quarter revenue last month, largely driven by the Activision Blizzard acquisition. ""Grand Theft Auto"" maker Take-Two Interactive said it would shut down two subsidiary studios as part of a mass layoff, Bloomberg News reported last week. Microsoft previously laid off 1,900 employees at Activision and Xbox at the start of the year. Some developers from Arkane Austin will join other studios and work on projects across Bethesda, the creator of ""The Elder Scrolls"" and ""Fallout"" titles.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/microsofts-xbox-shuts-multiple-studios-173130951.html,MSFT
Microsoft creates top secret AI tool for US spies,7/5/2024 17:10,Chris Price7 May 2024 at 10:10 am·45-min read,"Microsoft has developed artificial intelligence that can be used by American spies, deeming it safe because it is completely divorced from the internet. It is the first time a large language model has been fully separated from the online world and worked, a senior executive at the company told Bloomberg. Most AI models, including OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which is backed by Microsoft, rely on cloud services to learn and infer patterns from data. However, Microsoft said it wanted to deliver a truly secure system to the US intelligence community. William Chappell, Microsoft’s chief technology officer for strategic missions and technology, said the system has an “air-gapped” environment that is isolated from the internet. Sheetal Patel, assistant director of the CIA for the Transnational and Technology Mission Center, told a security conference last month: “There is a race to get generative AI onto intelligence data.” She said that the first country to use generative AI for their intelligence would win that race, adding: “And I want it to be us.” Read the latest updates below.

UPDATE 1-Microsoft hit with Spanish startups' complaint about cloud practices,7/5/2024 16:33,Foo Yun Chee7 May 2024 at 9:33 am·2-min read,"(Adds Microsoft comment) By Foo Yun Chee BRUSSELS, May 7 (Reuters) - Microsoft was hit with a Spanish startup group's complaint about its cloud practices to the Spanish antitrust regulator on Tuesday, the latest grievance over its fast-growing cloud computing services and which followed a trade group's EU complaint. The U.S. tech giant ranks second in the cloud computing sector, behind market leader Amazon but is expected to close the gap rapidly as a clutch of generative AI features powered by OpenAI's technology attract business users. The Spanish Startup Association, which represents more than 700 startups in Spain, cited a number of allegedly anti-competitive practices by Microsoft in recent years. ""Microsoft has not only taken advantage of the dominant position in the markets of Operating Systems (Windows) and traditional productivity software (Microsoft Office, Windows Server, SQL Server) to force the use of its Azure cloud, but they have also imposed artificial barriers that limit the ability of startups to compete fairly and competitively,"" the complaint seen by Reuters said. ""These practices include barriers to data portability or contractual conditions that restrict competition in software licenses, preventing the free choice of providers of these services, reducing the capacity for choice and flexibility that startups need to be able to be resilient, innovate and grow,"" the document said. Microsoft defended its cloud practices. ""Microsoft provides choice and flexibility for our customers to switch to another cloud provider at no cost, and our licensing terms enable our customers and other cloud providers to run and offer Microsoft software on every cloud,"" a spokesperson said. ""We will engage with the Spanish Startup Association to learn more about its concerns.""",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/1-microsoft-hit-spanish-startups-163351111.html,MSFT
It’s time for Apple to buy—not build—its way into AI,7/5/2024 15:36,Alexei Oreskovic7 May 2024 at 8:36 am·3-min read,"Raise your hand if you've heard this one before: Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans. Those 19 words—one imagines them etched in stone somewhere at Apple HQ in Cupertino, Calif.—have served as Apple's standard statement about acquisitions for years (to the point that tech reporters can recite the phrase from memory). As far as PR statements go, it's actually a pretty accurate description of Apple's approach to M&A. With the exception of 2014's still-perplexing $3 billion Beats acquisition, Apple likes to buy companies that are small and relatively low profile—typically they're the early pieces of whatever, longer-term technological puzzle Apple is quietly assembling (which could be anything from the VisionPro to its own line of in-house microprocessors). The problem for Apple is that there's only one tech puzzle to assemble that matters today: generative AI. It's a game changer, with the power to upend even the most dominant of business models. And it's too late for Apple to start putting that puzzle together on its own. Its biggest competitors, including Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Amazon, have already released AI products, while Apple is nowhere to be seen. To be a superpower in the age of AI probably requires owning a cutting-edge large language model. That's not something you can easily build from scratch—especially if you're trying to build version 1.0 and OpenAI is already about to release GPT 5.0. All of this is to say that this is not one of those ""from time to time"" moments in which Apple has the luxury to leisurely collect small AI startups here and there. If there was ever a time when Apple needed to ""think different,"" and buy its way into the market by acquiring a large company with a working product, this is it. There's plenty to choose from—Anthropic, Cohere, and Mistral, to name a few. On the video side of things, there's Runway. Just a few weeks ago, Inflection AI sold its IP to Microsoft, and much of its AI talent, including cofounder Mustafa Suleyman, joined Microsoft. How different would the landscape look right now if Apple had snagged the Inflection team? Antitrust is obviously a risk. But Apple can point to a market full of big fish like Microsoft, Google, Meta, Amazon, and Adobe. It's not as if Apple doesn't have the money. Apple ended the most recent quarter with $58 billion in net cash, and it's giving billions back to shareholders in massive buybacks and dividends. With AI about to transform the tech industry, it's stunning that one of the most innovative companies on Earth can't think of a better use for that capital.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/time-apple-buy-not-build-153639459.html,MSFT
12 Best Large-Cap Growth ETFs,7/5/2024 15:09,Hamna Asim7 May 2024 at 8:09 am·17-min read,"In this article, we discuss 12 best large-cap growth ETFs. If you want to skip our discussion on growth investing, head over to 5 Best Large-Cap Growth ETFs.  Large-cap growth funds focus on investing in big companies, those in the top 70% in terms of market value. Growth funds constitute companies expected to grow their revenue or earnings faster than their peers or the overall market. They are often seen as risky but can be good for investors who are not risk averse and prefer long-term investments. Tom Hancock, who heads focused equity at GMO, joined CNBC’s ETF Edge on November 15, 2023, and remarked that the growth trade momentum is aided by the leadership of mega-cap tech companies that are embracing artificial intelligence. Similarly, Nathan Geraci, president of The ETF Store, agreed with Hancock's observation but noted that only a couple of stocks are leading the growth outperformance. In his words, Geraci commented: “A lot of growth performance this year has been driven by the so-called Magnificent Seven, because if you look at many of the growth indices, they’re pretty top-heavy. The largest growth companies have been enough to really drive that performance differential versus value.” Currently, US small-cap stocks are experiencing their toughest period compared to larger companies in over two decades. This reflects the investor preference for mega-cap tech stocks while smaller players grapple with inflated interest rates. According to a Financial Times report, the Russell 2000 index has seen a 24% increase since the start of 2020, significantly trailing behind the S&P 500's impressive 60% surge during the same period. This deviation from historical norms, where smaller, fast-growing companies typically offer higher returns despite higher volatility, underscores the current market dynamics. Greg Tuorto, a small-cap portfolio manager at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, pointed out the lack of significant investment in the small-cap space since 2016 or 2017, highlighting the need for increased market enthusiasm, perhaps through M&A activity or a flourishing IPO market, to reignite small-cap growth. While there are indications of the equity market expanding beyond tech giants, persistent inflation and a strong job market have led traders to accept the likelihood of higher interest rates for longer than previously anticipated. In a scenario where the Federal Reserve maintains or even raises rates, smaller companies with significant short-term or floating-rate debt, like those in the Russell 2000, are likely to be most affected. Further making a positive case for large-cap ETFs compared to their small-cap counterparts, an academic research paper took a close look at 66 large-cap and 34 small-cap ETFs listed in the United States from 2012 to 2016, covering the full trading history of these funds. The author chose to focus on the US market because it is a major player globally, and he wanted a robust sample size for the analysis. The study partially confirms what's known as the ""size effect"". Essentially, small-cap ETFs showed better returns compared to large-cap ETFs when looking at both raw and adjusted numbers. However, it is not all smooth sailing for small caps – they come with higher risk, which does not quite balance out the gains. Plus, this outperformance is not consistent year after year. When adjusted for risk, small-cap ETFs actually fall behind their larger counterparts. The same trend holds true when comparing the performance rankings of large-cap and small-cap ETFs. Some of the best large-cap growth ETFs include Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETF (NYSE:SCHG), Vanguard Growth Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VUG), and Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ). These funds expose investors to growth stocks like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).

Kevin O’Leary’s Stock Portfolio: 10 Stock Picks for 2024,7/5/2024 15:02,Sheryar Siddiq7 May 2024 at 8:02 am·9-min read,"In this article, we discuss the 10 companies to consider in the portfolio of Kevin O’Leary for 2024. If you want to skip our overview of O'Leary's investment philosophy and learn about some more companies in his stock portfolio, go directly to Kevin O'Leary’s Stock Portfolio: 5 Stock Picks for 2024. Kevin O'Leary, affectionately known as Mr. Wonderful to fans and fellow venture capitalists, is renowned as one of the venture capitalists on ""Shark Tank"" and a commentator on economic news. The Irish-Canadian kickstarted his business journey by establishing the educational software company Softkey in 1986 by leveraging the proceeds from the sale of his SET share and a $10,000 investment from his mother. This venture eventually propelled him to the forefront of the business world. Softkey specialized in producing and distributing educational software in CD format, expanding its market presence through a series of mergers and acquisitions in the early 1990s. Notable acquisitions included WordStar, Spinnaker Software, and The Learning Company, the latter of which Softkey adopted as its name following the acquisition. In terms of investing in securities, O'Leary, Chairman of O’Shares Investment Advisors, advocates for including high-quality businesses with strong balance sheets and robust financial performance in investment portfolios. Additionally, he stresses the importance of diversification across various market sectors, with dividend payments from the companies under consideration deemed as perhaps the most vital factor. To that end, O’Shares Investment Advisors' ETF, ALPS O'Shares U.S. Quality Dividend ETF (BATS:OUSA), holds stocks embodying a blend of these three attributes. The ETF has delivered growth rates of 11.55% over the past year, 38.69% over the last five years, and an impressive 86.92% since its inception. Some notable names held by the ETF include the likes of Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). The venture capitalist recently outlined his investment approach on LinkedIn, stressing the significance of cash-flow-positive investments within a diversified portfolio. Here is what he said: “A couple of years back, I sold my ETF company to Alps, the biggest ETF player in the States. It’s called O’Shares, and that’s where my family’s wealth is parked. OUSA is part of the S&P 500, cherry-picking the highest quality balance sheets with positive cash flow from around 100 out of the 500 names. Then there’s OUSM, which grabs the Russell 2000 and weeds out the underperformers – those companies not making any real dough. Forget Shark Tank, forget Bitcoin. Sure, I’ve got a 5% stake in Bitcoin and another 5% in gold, but the meat of my US portfolio? It’s in OUSA or OUSM.” Speaking further on this, Kevin O’Leary, during his appearance on 'Good Morning America,' used some of his time to unveil a number of good stock picks for first-time investors, with The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) being one of his recommendations. While investors widely regard the home improvement retailer as a dependable choice, O’Leary is particularly fond of it due to its substantial size, robust balance sheet, and consistent dividends. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is also among O'Leary's top picks, and he holds a strong affinity for the company. ""I love it,"" he said, highlighting the company's diversified product portfolio ranging from COVID-19 vaccines to Tylenol. On the other hand, despite his reservations regarding Bitcoin ETFs, O'Leary acknowledges their regulatory approval as a significant milestone for the cryptocurrency industry. He believes that only a select few, particularly those backed by major industry players like Fidelity and BlackRock Inc., will thrive. O'Leary sees this as a step towards broader acceptance of digital payment systems, such as the USDC stablecoin. While exercising caution with Bitcoin ETFs, Mr. Wonderful remains optimistic about Bitcoin's future value, estimating it could reach between $150,000 and $250,000 by 2030. However, he disagrees with Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood's more ambitious prediction of Bitcoin hitting $1.5 million by 2030, unless there is an economic catastrophe, arguing that such a rapid surge in Bitcoin's value would imply a significant downturn in the US economy. The ""Shark Tank"" star also expressed concerns about the current state of the commercial real estate market, suggesting that it is on the verge of collapse. He believes that this downturn will have far-reaching consequences, particularly for investors and small business owners. O'Leary emphasized that the current situation is unprecedented, as the commercial real estate market is not anticipated to fully recover to pre-pandemic levels. Speaking to FOXBusiness, the venture capitalist made the following comments on office spaces: “Most of these buildings were built over the last 30 years and [have mortgages with] interest rates of less than 4%,” he said. “Now the Fed has raised rates to 5.5% terminal rate, which means these mortgages are going to be refinanced at 9% to 11% — so a 3x cost. So many of these buildings won’t be economically viable.” Helga Esteb/Shutterstock.com",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/kevin-o-leary-stock-portfolio-150244693.html,MSFT
12 Best Investments for Beginners in 2024,7/5/2024 15:00,Sheryar Siddiq7 May 2024 at 8:00 am·10-min read,"In this article, we will take a look at the 12 best investments for beginners in 2024. To skip our analysis of the recent market trends and market activity, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Investments for Beginners in 2024. With the first quarter of 2024 now concluded, the stock market has evolved. Continuing trends from Q4 2023, the period witnessed the sustained growth of artificial intelligence and technology stocks, with investors remaining optimistic about AI's potential across consumer and business applications, alongside expectations of multiple interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve throughout the year. However, as we move into the second quarter of the year, investor sentiment has shifted from anticipating a strong economic environment to reassessing strategies for allocating significant funds into the stock market. In April, U.S. job growth decelerated more than anticipated, with the annual wage increase dipping below 4.0% for the first time in nearly three years, according to the Labor Department's latest employment report released on April 3. The unemployment rate also rose slightly to 3.9% from March's 3.8%, attributed to a growing labor supply. Nonfarm payrolls expanded by 175,000 jobs last month, marking the lowest increase in six months, with revisions revealing 22,000 fewer jobs created in February and March than initially reported. Despite these figures, the jobless rate persisted below 4% for the 27th consecutive month. The signs of a cooling labor market sparked optimism that the U.S. central bank could orchestrate a ""soft landing"" for the economy, dispelling concerns of stagflation, which had been fueled by reports of subdued economic growth and elevated inflation in the first quarter. In that regard, Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman reiterated her readiness to raise the policy rate if progress stalls or reverses, while expressing confidence that inflation will continue to decline even as the central bank maintains its benchmark interest rate at current levels: ""My baseline outlook continues to be that inflation will decline further with the policy rate held steady, but I still see a number of upside inflation risks that affect my outlook. While the current stance of monetary policy appears to be at a restrictive level, I remain willing to raise the federal funds rate at a future meeting should the incoming data indicate that progress on inflation has stalled or reversed."" Although inflation has decreased from its peak in mid-2022, it remains significantly above the central bank's target range. Most reports this year have indicated an annual inflation rate of around 3%, with the Fed's preferred measure, the core personal consumption expenditures price (PCE) index, recently standing at 2.8%. Rising prices have led to upward pressure on wages, contributing to an inflationary environment that has prevented the Fed from taking aggressive steps to cut interest rates, despite market expectations suggesting otherwise. If you're a beginner in the world of investments and finance, diving right in can seem daunting with everything mentioned above. However, there are strategies to simplify the process and increase your chances of success. One approach is to focus on established, well-known companies with strong financial foundations. These household names often offer more stability and growth potential over time.

OpenAI to launch tool to detect images created by DALL-E 3,7/5/2024 13:36,Reuters7 May 2024 at 6:36 am·1-min read,"(Reuters) - OpenAI is launching a tool that can detect images created by its text-to-image generator DALL-E 3, the Microsoft-backed startup said on Tuesday amid rising worries about the influence of AI-generated content in this year's global elections. The company said the tool correctly identified images created by DALL-E 3 about 98% of the time in internal testing and can handle common modifications such as compression, cropping and saturation changes with minimal impact. The ChatGPT creator also plans to add tamper-resistant watermarking to mark digital content such as photos or audio with a signal that should be hard to remove. As part of the efforts, OpenAI has also joined an industry group that includes Google, Microsoft and Adobe and plans to provide a standard that would help trace origin of different media. In April, during the ongoing general election in India, fake videos of two Bollywood actors that are seen criticizing Prime Minister Narendra Modi have gone viral online. The spread of AI-generated content and deepfakes are being increasingly used in India and in elections elsewhere in the world including in the U.S., Pakistan and Indonesia. OpenAI said it is joining Microsoft in launching a $2 million ""societal resilience"" fund to support AI education.

"British Microsoft-backed self-driving startup Wayve raises $1 billion, clocking new high in Europe-based AI funding deal",7/5/2024 13:21,Prarthana Prakash7 May 2024 at 6:21 am·4-min read,"British self-driving startup Wayve has raised $1 billion in its latest funding round, setting a record for venture capital investment into a Europe-based AI company. Announced Tuesday, the Series C round, led by Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, also included AI giants Nvidia and Microsoft. London-based Wayve, founded in 2017, makes software for autonomous driving that enables vehicles to learn as they drive and make on-the-road decisions on their own. Wayve counts Microsoft and Meta’s chief scientist, Yann Le Cunn, among its high-profile backers. The company, founded by University of Cambridge PhD students Alex Kendall and Amar Shah, had raised $300 million in previous funding rounds. The company’s valuation following the latest venture capital investment has not been disclosed. Wayve will use the funds to expand and launch its AI software products—which it refers to as “Embodied AI” because similar systems could be used for any autonomous device that has to navigate and act in the physical world—eventually deploying those systems in vehicles built by major automotive manufacturers. The startup’s software is different from previous generations of self-driving AI because its models are trained “end-to-end”—taking in camera and sensor data about what is happening around the vehicle and outputting the best driving action to take. The company has also trained an AI system that pairs a large language model with a driving model, so that a vehicle can explain what it is seeing and why it is taking certain actions, and also take instruction in natural language. Earlier self-driving cars relied on multiple small AI models, each of which did one particular thing, such as identify objects in camera data, and then fused these small models together with complicated rules-based software to arrive at driving decisions. “This significant funding milestone highlights our team’s unwavering conviction that Embodied AI will address the long-standing challenges the industry has faced in scaling this technology to everyone, everywhere,” Wayve cofounder and CEO Kendall said in a statement Tuesday. The investment is a big win for Britain, which already has twice as many AI-focused companies as any other European country, employing over 50,000 people and contributing £3.7 billion ($4.6 billion) to the economy. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has tried to position the country as a global AI hub, at the forefront of both development and regulation. Votes of confidence from leading companies have helped affirm the U.K.’s position. For instance, in April Microsoft announced it would open an office dedicated to AI research in London.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/british-microsoft-backed-self-driving-132135143.html,MSFT

Microsoft hit with Spanish startups' complaint about cloud practices,7/5/2024 16:34,Foo Yun CheeUpdated 7 May 2024 at 9:34 am·2-min read,"By Foo Yun Chee BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Microsoft was hit with a Spanish startup group's complaint about its cloud practices to the Spanish antitrust regulator on Tuesday, the latest grievance over its fast-growing cloud computing services and which followed a trade group's EU complaint. The U.S. tech giant ranks second in the cloud computing sector, behind market leader Amazon but is expected to close the gap rapidly as a clutch of generative AI features powered by OpenAI's technology attract business users. The Spanish Startup Association, which represents more than 700 startups in Spain, cited a number of allegedly anti-competitive practices by Microsoft in recent years. ""Microsoft has not only taken advantage of the dominant position in the markets of Operating Systems (Windows) and traditional productivity software (Microsoft Office, Windows Server, SQL Server) to force the use of its Azure cloud, but they have also imposed artificial barriers that limit the ability of startups to compete fairly and competitively,"" the complaint seen by Reuters said. ""These practices include barriers to data portability or contractual conditions that restrict competition in software licenses, preventing the free choice of providers of these services, reducing the capacity for choice and flexibility that startups need to be able to be resilient, innovate and grow,"" the document said. Microsoft defended its cloud practices. ""Microsoft provides choice and flexibility for our customers to switch to another cloud provider at no cost, and our licensing terms enable our customers and other cloud providers to run and offer Microsoft software on every cloud,"" a spokesperson said. ""We will engage with the Spanish Startup Association to learn more about its concerns.""

""Interest rates are higher for longer than most people supposed in the middle of last year.

15 Best Places to Retire in Alabama,6/5/2024 19:47,Rabia Mazhar6 May 2024 at 12:47 pm·12-min read,"This article takes a look at the 15 best places to retire in Alabama. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis of the investment landscape surrounding US retirement, you may go to 5 Best Places to Retire in Alabama. Turns out college students aren’t the only ones prone to leaving things to the last minute - several adults are pretty much on the same track when it comes to saving for their retirement. In the US, there is no legal requirement under which a company has to offer a 401(k) plan to its employees in most states- although companies such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) do offer 401(k) plans with partial matching. Without this requirement, many people miss out on saving for retirement altogether. In fact, according to Ramsey Solutions, employer-sponsored retirement savings plans are withheld from about a third of US workers, whereas the latest Survey of Consumer Finances reports that a massive 46% of Americans are without a retirement account altogether. All this does not seem very promising, especially with a Northwestern Mutual study revealing that Americans themselves believe they require a whopping $1.46 million for a comfortable retirement. The question of the hour, then, is how can this disparity between what Americans need in their retirement and what they currently have be solved? Founder and CEO of hedge fund management company Pershing Square Capital Management, Bill Ackman, has a rather unique perspective. Ackman proposes that the US government give every newborn child in the country seven grand. Of course, Ackman doesn’t propose simply handing the money away. Instead, he details putting $7,000 into an account when a child is born, barring it from withdrawals, exempting it from taxation, using it in index fund investment, and letting the amount compound. “We can't wait until people start creating an IRA or a 401(k) by the time they're, you know, 25 or 30 or 35 ... Just because of the laws of compounding. That extra 25 years is very, very material.” -Bill Ackman, Founder and CEO, Pershing Square Capital Management According to numbers by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly 3.6 million children were born in the US in 2023. If Ackman’s advice is implemented, the cost comes out to about $25 billion. While this number may seem shockingly high, it’s a drop in the ocean compared to the US government’s 2024 fiscal year spending which included a national defense budget of $433 billion. As for more real avenues, there are other paths that individuals can explore for retirement savings in the case of their company not offering a 401(k) plan. Some options that Americans can look towards include traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs, and health savings accounts. Each of these has its own benefit. For instance, traditional IRAs allow you to accumulate tax-advantaged retirement dollars, Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals and growth during retirement as well as flexibility as there are no minimum distributions, and health savings accounts are also known for their tax-free growth. Of course, these are just some of the retirement savings options available to individuals, and the investment world is much more vast. So, even if you don’t enroll in plans such as those offered by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) employees, all is not lost when it comes to saving and investing for your Golden Years. There’s no age limit to it either - even if you’ve reached your 50s, there are still steps that you can take to secure your retirement. For possible ideas, you can refer to retirement savings tips for 55-to-64-year-olds. Speaking of saving and investing, the amount that you accumulate for your retirement is directly tied to the location of your retirement. Consider Alabama, for instance - $2,500 a month would fare very differently than in states such as California or New Jersey. Starting off with one of the biggest monthly expenses, the state of Alabama is extremely accommodating when it comes to rent. Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) lists the median price for a one-bedroom rental in Alabama to sit at $925 - a whole 42% lower than Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z)’s reported national median of $1,600. The state is also tax-friendly toward retirees. Not only is Alabama among the states that won’t tax Social Security income in 2024, but private and public pensions are also exempt from taxation. On the non-financial side, there are other benefits to an Alabama retirement with climate being one of them. The state enjoys a temperate humid subtropical climate, ideal for retirees who want to avoid extreme weather conditions. All in all, retiring in Alabama is a good idea.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/15-best-places-retire-alabama-194747837.html,MSFT

15 Countries with the Highest Average Salaries in Asia,6/5/2024 16:47,Afifa Mushtaque6 May 2024 at 9:47 am·9-min read,"In this article, we will look at the 15 countries with the highest average salaries in Asia. We have also discussed the economic development taking place in Asia in 2024. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Countries with the Highest Average Salaries in Asia. According to the Asian Development Bank, Developing Asia is forecasted to grow by 4.9% in 2024 and maintain the same rate in 2025, driven by factors like the end of interest rate hikes and a recovery in goods exports, especially in semiconductor demand. India is leading in the investment-driven growth, positioning itself as a major economic engine in the region. Moreover, inflation in developing Asia is projected to be 3.2% in 2024, slightly decreasing to 3.0% in 2025. Subregionally, South Asia is leading in growth, with forecasts of 6.3% in 2024 and 6.6% in 2025. India's growth is anticipated to remain strong at 7.0% in fiscal year 2024, supported by rising consumption and investment. Bangladesh expects growth driven by garment exports, while Bhutan sees growth due to hydropower investment. Pakistan and Sri Lanka are set to recover from previous contractions, though challenges like inflation persist. Southeast Asia forecasts growth of 4.6% in 2024 and 4.7% in 2025, with Indonesia, Thailand, Viet Nam, the Philippines, and Malaysia driving growth through strong domestic demand and recovering exports. Meanwhile, the Pacific expects a slight decline in 2024 before picking up in 2025, with Papua New Guinea leading growth due to increased mining activity. While the economic development looks promising, it is worth highlighting that in South Asia, job creation has struggled to keep up with the rapid expansion of the working-age population, according to a report by the World Bank. Over the period from 2000 to 2023, employment grew at a rate of 1.7% annually, while the working-age population increased by 1.9% each year. This imbalance led to a situation where the region was only able to generate an average of 10 million jobs annually, despite a working-age population growth of 19 million per year. India, the largest economy in South Asia, has experienced major challenges in job creation despite strong economic growth. The country's employment ratio declined over the same period, except for a partial rebound in 2023. While India's economy is expected to expand at a rate of 6.6% with the potential for even stronger growth, private investment remains weak. Speaking of jobs, finance specialists and information technology specialists are two of the highest paying jobs in Asia. To read more about highest payings jobs, see the Best Remote Jobs That Pay at Least $100 an Hour. Owing to the economic potential of Asia, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is currently involved in several contributions to Asia, particularly in Malaysia, with a landmark investment of $2.2 billion over the next four years. It is Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s largest commitment in its 32-year history in Malaysia and is essentially focused on several key areas such as building digital infrastructure and creating AI skilling opportunities. The investment will also entail building cloud and AI infrastructure in Malaysia, which will not only meet the growing demand for cloud computing services but also enable the country to capitalize on the economic opportunities presented by AI technology. Additionally, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) aims to provide AI skilling opportunities for an additional 200,000 people in Malaysia and hence, contribute to the development of a skilled workforce prepared for the AI era. Furthermore, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is strengthening its partnership with the Government of Malaysia to establish a national AI Centre of Excellence and enhance the country’s cybersecurity capabilities. While Asia has been a hot destination for investments by several multinational companies, it is not immune to global lay offs. For example, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) plans to slash around 50 investment banking jobs in the Asia-Pacific region, with the majority concentrated in Hong Kong and China. These cuts will affect roughly 13% of the regional banking workforce and highlight the severity of the challenges facing the industry.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/15-countries-highest-average-salaries-164711109.html,MSFT

Here's Why We Think Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Might Deserve Your Attention Today,5/5/2024 13:01,editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St)5 May 2024 at 6:01 am·3-min read,"For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away. So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it.  View our latest analysis for Microsoft  If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Microsoft managed to grow EPS by 16% per year, over three years. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up. Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. The music to the ears of Microsoft shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 41% to 45% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book. In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image. Fortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of Microsoft's future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting. Owing to the size of Microsoft, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$1.0b. This comes in at 0.03% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors. One important encouraging feature of Microsoft is that it is growing profits. If that's not enough on its own, there is also the rather notable levels of insider ownership.

The ending of Google's monopoly trial has Silicon Valley on edge,5/5/2024 11:38,Alexis Keenan·Reporter5 May 2024 at 4:38 am·5-min read,"Google has a lot at stake as a federal judge weighs whether the tech giant’s search empire should be broken up. So does the rest of Silicon Valley. A landmark antitrust case pitting Google (GOOG, GOOGL) against the Justice Department entered its final stage this past week as prosecutors from the federal government and 14 states said in their closing arguments that Google illegally monopolized the online search and search advertising markets. Google's lawyer, John Schmidtlein, pushed back one more time with a claim the company has made from the beginning: ""Google is winning because it’s better,"" he said. A government win would certainly threaten a giant piece of Google’s $237.8 billion profit engine. But the outcome, which will be decided by US District Judge Amit Mehta in the weeks or months to come, also has giant implications for some of the other big names in the tech world. That's because Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) are defending themselves against a series of other federal- and state-led antitrust suits, some of which make similar claims, and because all three stand to lose or gain depending on the outcome. In Apple’s case, US attorneys have alleged the iPhone maker blocked rivals from entering the smartphone market by using a “web of contractual restrictions.” A similar claim was made by the government in Google's case, which hinges on several types of contracts that Google allegedly used to cement its search dominance. ""The broad lessons here are a long way off, but this is clearly a really important time when the very first of these tech cases is going to be decided,"" said University of Washington antitrust professor Douglas Ross. ""I do think they're going to be interested in how narrowly or broadly [the judge] defines the markets here,"" Ross added, ""and if there is any learning in what he writes that might have application elsewhere.""",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/the-ending-of-googles-monopoly-trial-has-silicon-valley-on-edge-113835464.html,MSFT
Warren Buffett pays tribute to Charlie Munger on a 'tough day' for shareholders,4/5/2024 16:29,Seana Smith·Host4 May 2024 at 9:29 am·4-min read,"A new vibe at the Woodstock of capitalism. Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK-A, BRK-B) annual shareholder meeting on Saturday marked a new era for the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett. It’s the investing legend’s first without his right-hand man, Charlie Munger, who passed away on Nov. 28, 2023, just shy of his 100th birthday. While Munger’s absence is significant, his presence loomed throughout the CHI Health Center in Omaha, Nebraska. Charlie Munger’s name was among the first words uttered by Buffett as he took the stage. Buffett described Munger as the “architect of Berkshire,” and his request to shareholders to “join me in applauding Charlie” was met with cheers and a standing ovation by a crowd that included the likes of Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, Citigroup (C) CEO Jane Fraser, and Microsoft (MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates. “In terms of having a partner, I simply cannot think of a conversation I had with Charlie that he misled me,” Buffett later told the packed house. Buffett added: “In terms of managing money, there wasn’t anybody better in the world to talk to for many, many decades than Charlie.” The meeting started with a video tribute to the former vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, which included a number of Munger’s famous one-liners from prior meetings, including “I think that every time you saw the word EBITDA, you should substitute the word 'bulls***' earnings.” EBITDA is more formally known on the Street as shorthand for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Companies tend to hype the metric as a purer read on the health of the business rather than net profits. “It’s a bittersweet moment, … a tough day for a lot of people,” new Brooks Running CEO Dan Sheridan told me of Munger’s absence.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-pays-tribute-to-charlie-munger-on-a-tough-day-for-shareholders-162940889.html,MSFT
23 Most Profitable Stocks of the Last 12 Months,4/5/2024 11:38,Usman Kabir4 May 2024 at 4:38 am·23-min read,"In this article, we discuss the 23 most profitable stocks of the last 12 months. If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to 5 Most Profitable Stocks of the Last 12 Months.  The United States stock market has come a long way since the turn of the millennium more than two decades ago. Emerging from the dotcom boom and bust without permanent damage, the economy has faced the financial meltdown of 2008, a tech-enabled boom that has resulted in trillion dollar valuations, and the pandemic crisis of 2020 that ground business to almost a complete halt across the globe. From 2003 to 2023, the benchmark S&P 500 has registered double digits annual returns thirteen times. Investors at the stock market have made money from this growth by piling into profitable stocks like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). However, even as these tech stocks become the hottest equities, old-school value investing has yet to lose charm. Value investors who like to invest in profitable companies with high gross margins and net income have made shrewd investments in businesses with a solid track record over these twenty years. For example instead of NVDA, we identified the cheapest AI stock that is trading at less than 5 times market value excluding cash and investments using the value investing approach. The present condition of the stock market is better understood in the context of a recent research report by investment advisory Deutsche Bank. The report underlines that the seven biggest companies in the S&P 500 now have a combined market capitalization that make these firms the second biggest stock market in the world, almost double the size of the Japanese market that is in fourth position. Jim Reid, the head of global economics and thematic research at the advisory, has warned that this makes the US market most concentrated in history.  The fortunes of these firms are set to rise even further as AI hype and rate cut expectations serve to increase interest in growth stocks. Businesses are investing heavily in AI tools to keep pace with industry demand in this regard. Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), recently highlighted the role that he expected AI to play in changing work trends in the coming years and months. He made these comments during the second quarter earnings call at the end of January.  “A growing body of evidence makes clear the role AI will play in transforming work. Our own research, as well as external studies, show as much as 70% improvement in productivity, using generative AI for specific work tasks, and overall early Copilot for Microsoft 365 users were 29% faster in the series of tasks, like searching, writing, and summarizing. Two months in, we have seen faster adoption than either our E3 or E5 suites as enterprises, like Dentsu, Honda, Pfizer, all deploy Copilot to their employees, and we are expanding availability to organizations of all sizes. We're also seeing a Copilot ecosystem begin to emerge ISVs like Atlassian, Mural, and Trello, as well as customers like Air India, Bayer, and Siemens have all built plug-ins for specific lines of business that extend Copilot's capabilities.” Our Methodology To select stocks for this list, we used the FinViz stock screener to identify companies with high gross margins and net income. The Finance Charts database was then used to identify firms with the best net income growth in the past twenty years. The analyst ratings of each stock are also discussed to provide readers with some context for their investment choices. The hedge fund sentiment around each stock was calculated using the data of around 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the fourth quarter of 2023. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator. An overhead view of a bustling stock exchange, with brokers and traders exchanging stocks.

Microsoft debuts new Copilot+ PCs using OpenAI's GPT-4o while taking shots at Apple,20/5/2024 18:04,Daniel Howley·Technology Editor20 May 2024 at 11:04 am·3-min read,"Microsoft (MSFT) is going all in on AI for the PC. The company on Monday announced a new category of PCs called Copilot+ PCs, a new variety of computers equipped with so-called AI PC chips and running Microsoft's latest version of Windows 11 and its Copilot AI software. Microsoft also revealed that its Copilot+ PCs will now run on OpenAI's GPT-4o model, allowing the assistant to interact with your PC via text, video, and voice. Users will also be able to share their screen with Copilot and have a natural conversation with the app. ""The richest AI experiences will harness the power of the cloud and the edge working together in concert. This in turn will lead to a new category of devices that turn the world itself into a prompt,"" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said on Monday. ""For us, this vision starts with our most beloved and most widely used canvas: Windows."" Microsoft's new PC push comes as the PC market enters the early innings of a turnaround after two years of declines. According to IDC, PC shipments grew 1.5% in the first quarter, compared to a 28.7% decline during the same time in 2023. Yusuf Mehdi, Microsoft executive vice president and consumer chief marketing officer, said the company expects over 50 million AI PCs to be purchased over the next year. Copilot+ PCs are an offshoot of AI PCs, which are generally defined as PCs running on Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), and Qualcomm (QCOM) chips with built-in neural processing units, or neural engines, that can run generative AI applications locally without needing to connect to the internet. Copilot+ PCs will include 16GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage to ensure performance. In a pre-recorded demonstration of Copilot's GPT-4o integration, a user fired up the game Minecraft and asked Copilot how to craft a sword. The assistant could see what the user was doing in the game and walk him through everything he needed to do to build the item. Microsoft says it will integrate Copilot for a number of gaming apps, and because it will run on your PC's NPU rather than its GPU, it shouldn't hurt overall performance.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-debuts-new-copilot-pcs-using-openais-gpt-4o-while-taking-shots-at-apple-180409406.html,MSFT
Satya Nadella transformed Microsoft’s culture during his decade as CEO by turning everyone into ‘learn-it-alls’ instead of ‘know-it-alls’,20/5/2024 19:58,Chloe Berger20 May 2024 at 12:58 pm·3-min read,"Smart alecks rub most people the wrong way, including, but not limited to, Satya Nadella. Taking the helm at the software company 10 years ago, Nadella wasn’t afraid of making waves and pushing his new employees to think differently. Instead of resting on its laurels, Microsoft must “stay humble, stay hungry, and exhibit a growth mindset,” he told Fortune’s Jeremy Kahn. Those who live by a growth mindset “believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work—brains and talent are just the starting point,” Carol Dweck, coiner of the term and a Stanford psychologist, said in 2015. That’s contrasted from a fixed mindset, wherein people believe their skills are innate or a fixed quality, or that “talent alone creates success.” Nadella doesn’t buy the latter concept. Staying on your toes in the ever-developing tech world where AI is changing the game means sometimes being willing to dance a bit, or move with the flow. Indeed, the growth mindset has become the software company’s most favored buzzword of the decade, leaping from every intro psych class textbook into the speeches of Microsoft executives. The shift from being a “know-it-all” to “learn-it-all” is a defining part of Nadella’s messaging when it comes to his desired workplace culture, writes Kahn. At Microsoft, being a learn-it-all requires an embrace of upskilling, according to a company blog post, which said it’s difficult, if not impossible, to gain new skills if a company's culture says ""we’ve learned all we can."" “If you take two kids at school, one of them has more innate capability but is a know-it-all. The other person has less innate capability but is a learn-it-all. The learn-it-all does better than the know-it-all,” Nadella said back in 2019 on the podcast Hello Monday. That’s a sharp left turn from a pre-Nadella culture, explained Scott Hanselman, vice president of Microsoft’s developer community. The change is seen down to the software itself. Hanselman said the tech giant had a reputation for forcing developers to use the company’s entire tech stack. There’s less of a top-down approach at play now, as developers are now allowed to select certain features to implement and are asked for feedback on what they’d like to see more from the company. “Azure is beholden to them; they are the customer, and they will keep using it if they find it helpful and delightful,” he told Kahn.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/satya-nadella-transformed-microsoft-culture-195843116.html,MSFT
Microsoft makes its AI pitch with Copilot+ PCs,20/5/2024 19:18,"Martyn Landi, PA Technology Correspondent20 May 2024 at 12:18 pm·3-min read","Microsoft is the latest tech giant to make its pitch for being the leading AI company in 2024, unveiling new PCs built around its Copilot AI assistant.

Microsoft's AI chatbot will 'recall' everything you do on a PC,20/5/2024 21:55,"MATT O'BRIEN, MANUEL VALDESUpdated 20 May 2024 at 2:55 pm·3-min read","REDMOND, Wash. (AP) — Microsoft wants laptop users to get so comfortable with its artificial intelligence chatbot that it will remember everything you're doing on your computer and help figure out what you want to do next. The software giant on Monday revealed a new class of AI-imbued personal computers as it confronts heightened competition from Big Tech rivals in pitching generative AI technology that can compose documents, make images and serve as a lifelike personal assistant at work or home. The announcements ahead of Microsoft's annual Build developer conference centered on fusing its AI assistant, called Copilot, into the Windows operating system for PCs, where Microsoft already has the eyes of millions of consumers. The new features will include Windows Recall, giving the AI assistant what Microsoft describes as “photographic memory” of a person's virtual activity. Microsoft promises to protect users' privacy by giving them the option to filter out what they don't want tracked, and keeping the tracking on the device. It's a step toward machines that “instantly see us, hear, reason about our intent and our surroundings,” said CEO Satya Nadella. “We’re entering this new era where computers not only understand us, but can actually anticipate what we want and our intent,"" Nadella said at an event at the company's headquarters in Redmond, Washington. The conference that starts Tuesday in Seattle follows big AI announcements last week from rival Google, as well as Microsoft's close business partner OpenAI, which built the AI large language models on which Microsoft's Copilot is based. Google rolled out a retooled search engine that periodically puts AI-generated summaries over website links at the top of the results page; while also showing off a still-in-development AI assistant Astra that will be able to “see” and converse about things shown through a smartphone’s camera lens. ChatGPT-maker OpenAI unveiled a new version of its chatbot last week, demonstrating an AI voice assistant with human characteristics that can banter about what someone's wearing and even attempt to assess a person’s emotions. The voice sounded so much like Scarlett Johansson playing an AI character in the sci-fi movie “Her” that OpenAI dropped the voice from its collection Monday. OpenAI also rolled out a new desktop version of ChatGPT designed for Apple's Mac computers.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/microsofts-ai-chatbot-recall-everything-185736872.html,MSFT

Is Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) the Best Quality Dividend Stock to Buy According to Reddit?,20/5/2024 16:43,Vardah Gill20 May 2024 at 9:43 am·5-min read,"Dividend stocks are in the limelight this year as many tech companies have joined the dividend club since the start of 2024. In addition to this, global companies have distributed a record amount in dividends last year. Retail investors are always on the lookout for income stocks. For this reason, we have analyzed the 15 Best Quality Dividend Stocks to Buy According to Reddit in a new article. In this article we are going to take a look at whether Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the best quality dividend stock to buy according to Reddit. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a Washington-based multinational technology company that is mainly known for its Windows operating systems. In addition to this, the company also offers a wide range of services through its cloud-computing platform. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was the most popular company among elite funds at the end of Q4 2023, with 302 hedge funds holding stakes in the company, as per Insider Monkey’s database. The collective value of these stakes is over $87.3 billion. drserg / Shutterstock.com Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has revolutionized both personal and business computing with its products for the software industry. The company’s Azure cloud computing platform is widely gaining momentum among business professionals. Its revenue from cloud services is a significant contributor to its total earnings. In the company’s most recent quarter, it reported a 23% year-over-year growth in its cloud revenue at over $35 billion. Vulcan Value Partners mentioned Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q1 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say: “Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the world’s largest software company with a broad range of offerings including Microsoft office, gaming, Azure cloud computing, LinkedIn, and more. It was a material contributor for the second consecutive quarter, and we discussed it at length in last quarter’s letter. The company continues to execute well.” Where tech companies mainly prefer reinvesting profits into growth and innovation, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) changed the paradigm and initiated its dividend policy in 2003 with a per-share dividend of $0.08. The company has been growing its payouts for the past 18 consecutive years, currently offering a quarterly dividend of $0.75 per share. In addition to this, the company’s 5-year average dividend growth rate comes in at 10.23%. With a payout ratio of 25.3%, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s dividend is also sustainable. This means that the company distributes less than one-third of its profits to shareholders as dividends. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) recently announced its fiscal Q3 2024 earnings and reported revenue of roughly $61.8 billion, which showed a 17% growth from the same period last year. The revenue not only showed growth but also beat analysts’ estimates by $1.01 billion. Its operating income amounted to $27.6 billion, up 23% from the third quarter of 2023. During the quarter, the company generated $32 billion in operating cash flow, up from $24.4 billion in the prior year period. The company’s solid cash position enabled it to uphold its commitment to shareholders by returning $8.4 billion to them through dividends and share repurchases in Q3 2024. While Microsoft Corporation's (NASDAQ:MSFT) dividend is strong and sustainable, the stock’s dividend yield tends to come up short when compared to some other high-yield dividend stocks in the market. As of May 18, the stock has a dividend yield of 0.71%, which is less than a 1.3% yield for the S&P 500. The low dividend yield does not satisfy income investors, who seek regular income on their dividend investments. The stock can be added to a diversified dividend portfolio but this means missing out on other high-yield dividend stock opportunities. According to the Reddit community, Microsoft is currently offering strong financial health along with stable dividend growth. However, some Redditors expressed concerns about the stock being modestly overvalued. The stock is currently trading at a P/E multiple of 36.5x, which is seen as too high by some. Moreover, its competitive industry may push the company to prioritize capital expenditure over dividends to remain relevant.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-corporation-nasdaq-msft-best-164343928.html,MSFT
Sony Had A Good Q4 Game But It Needs To Figure Out How To Evolve Beyond PlayStation,20/5/2024 16:11,Upwallstreet20 May 2024 at 9:11 am·2-min read,"On Tuesday, Sony Group Corporation (NYSE: SONY) reported its fourth quarter results. Sony’s net profit grew from stronger earnings that were generated by its gaming and move business. For the three months that ended in March,  Sony reported revenue grew 13% YoY to 3.481 trillion yen, while net profit rose 34% YoY to 189.005 billion yen which is about $1.21 billion. The gaming business reported that operating profit more than doubled to 105.98 billion yen, while the movie business followed with a nearly doubled operating profit of 30.67 billion yen. For the fiscal year, Sony sold 20.8 million units of PlayStation 5, which is more than 19.1 million units it sold during the previous fiscal year. Like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Sony annoucned it will be laying off about 900 employees from its PlayStation business in response to the videogame industry’s struggles to regain its vigor in a post-pandemic reality. Back in October, Microsoft laid off about 8% of its videogaming workforce. Even GameStop Corporation (NYSE: GME) also announced job cuts. Moreover, the videogame retailer’s stock plummeted on Friday as meme-stock mania faded. GameStop reported preliminary first quarter results and they showed a first quarter drop in sales. GameStop expects first quarter sales to range between $872 million to $892 million while it reported $1.24 billion during last year’s comparable quarter. But, GameStop is also expecting to narrow down its net loss from last year’s $50.5 million to somewhere between $27 million and $37 million. The Japanese entertainment and electronics company plans to spin off its financial business, which is why it guided for a revenue drop of 5.5% to 12.310 trillion yen and a net profit decline of 4.7% to 925 billion yen. However, Sony guided for its game business operating profit to continue to rise at 6.8% to 310 billion yen. Sony also expects its movie business profits to rise 2% to 120 billion yen. Sony and Microsoft rivalry will live on, but there’s bigger fish to fry. Both for Sony and its rival Microsoft, findings ways to grow revenue is more important than winning the console war. Microsoft undoubtedly upleveled its game by acquiring Activision Blizzard but console wars are becoming less and less relevant as both Microsoft and Sony need to figure out how to evolve in the new gaming era that is in the making.

A Momentum Score of B makes SNOW further attractive to investors. You can find the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. SNOW has been suffering from challenging macroeconomic conditions, including persistent inflation, which have hurt its customer spending patterns.

Snowpark is expected to contribute 3% to product revenues in fiscal 2025. Product revenues are expected to be $3.25 billion, indicating 22% year-over-year growth for fiscal 2025.The growing adoption of Snowpark by data scientists and engineers is expected to have aided the company’s top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter. For first-quarter 2025, Snowflake expects revenues between $745 million and $750 million, implying year-over-year growth between 26% and 27%.Newly introduced solutions, including Cortex, a new fully-managed service making AI simple and secure, Streamlit in Snowflake, Snowpark ML Modeling API, and Cortex ML functions, are expected to have benefited top-line growth.

The index crossed 40,000 for the first time on May 16. The Dow has been on a rally since the beginning of the year. The Dow has registered 19 record closing highs in 2024. Year to date, the blue-chip index has gained 7.9% and has now ended in the green for five consecutive weeks. Positive economic data has been responsible for the Dow’s recent rally. The Labor Department reported earlier this month that inflation eased in April after increasing in the first three months of the year. The consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.3% month over month in April, lower than the consensus estimate of a rise of 0.4%. On a year-over-year basis, CPI rose 3.4%, in line with analysts’ expectations. Core CPI, which excludes the volatile food and energy prices, also rose 0.3% sequentially in April after increasing 0.4% in the first three months of the year. Year over year, CPI rose 3.6% in April, the lowest monthly increase since April 2021. Besides, job additions to the economy slowed in April, indicating that the labor market is finally cooling. Also, U.S. GDP grew a meager 1.6% in the first quarter after rising 3.4% in the final quarter of 2023, suggesting a slowdown. A slowdown in the manufacturing and services sector PMI in April further suggested a slowing economy, fueling the rally. Investors are again optimistic that the Federal Reserve will soon start its planned rate cuts. Last month, the central bank said that it’s unlikely that there will be another interest rate hike. Moreover, the Fed still plans three 25-basis-point rate cuts by the end of 2024. Markets are now pricing in a 73.2% chance that the Fed will cut the benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points in September, according to the CME FedWatch tool.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/4-blue-chip-stocks-focus-130400181.html,MSFT

Microsoft debuts 'Copilot+' PCs with AI features,20/5/2024 22:20,Max A. CherneyUpdated 20 May 2024 at 3:20 pm·4-min read,"By Max A. Cherney SEATTLE (Reuters) -Microsoft on Monday debuted a new category of personal computers with AI features as it rushes to build the emerging technology into products across its business and compete with Alphabet and Apple. At an event on its campus in Redmond, Washington, Chief Executive Satya Nadella introduced what Microsoft calls ""Copilot+"" PCs, saying that it and a range of manufacturers would sell them, including Acer and Asustek Computer. Microsoft launched the laptops as its shares trade near record highs following a Wall Street rally driven by expectations that AI will fuel strong profit growth for the company and its Big Tech rivals. Able to handle more artificial-intelligence tasks without calling on cloud data centers, the new computers will start at $1,000 and begin shipping on June 18. The ability to crunch AI data directly on the computer lets Copilot+ include a feature called ""Recall."" ""Recall"" tracks everything done on the computer, from Web browsing to voice chats, creating a history stored on the computer that the user can search when they need to remember something they did, even months later. The company also demonstrated its Copilot voice assistant acting as a real-time virtual coach to a user playing the ""Minecraft"" video game. Yusuf Mehdi, who heads up consumer marketing for Microsoft, said the company expects that 50 million AI PCs will be purchased over the next year. At the press event, he said faster AI assistants that run directly on a PC will be ""the most compelling reason to upgrade your PC in a long time."" Global PC shipments dipped about 15% to 242 million last year, according to research firm Gartner, which suggests Microsoft expects the new category of computers to account for around one-fifth of all PCs sold. ""People just need to be convinced that the device experience alone justifies this entirely new category of Copilot+ machines,” said analyst Ben Bajarin of Creative Strategies.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-unveil-ai-devices-features-100141507.html,MSFT
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is facing the AI arms race with urgency—and maybe a little paranoia,20/5/2024 9:47,"Diane Brady, Nicholas Gordon20 May 2024 at 2:47 am·3-min read","Good morning. In his decade as CEO of Microsoft, Satya Nadella has transformed a troubled tech giant into the world’s most valuable company, with a market cap of more than $3.1 trillion. In his 32 years at Microsoft, though, Nadella has lived through four major technology platform shifts—from PCs to the web, mobile, cloud computing and now AI—and he knows how the company struggled to compete after some of them. That may explain the air of urgency and mild paranoia that Nadella projects in Fortune’s latest cover story on Nadella by my colleague Jeremy Kahn. As Nadella told Jeremy: “When the paradigm shifts, do you have something to contribute? Because there is no God-given right to exist if you don’t have anything relevant.” With Microsoft’s partnership and $13 billion-plus investment in OpenAI, Nadella has given the tech giant a clear lead in the AI era. (The Microsoft Build developer conference kicks off tomorrow and is likely to feature several significant AI-fueled upgrades.) As Jeremy points out in his article, the company’s ties to OpenAI also come with risk, as we saw when OpenAI’s board fired—and then begrudgingly rehired—CEO Sam Altman last year. The recent departure of OpenAI researchers Ilya Sutskever and Jan Leike also sparked concern since it led to the dissolution of a team focused on the safety of hypothetical future AI systems that would be more capable than any human. And plenty of rivals are rushing in to compete. No one is more aware of the risks than Nadella. He lived through the Microsoft antitrust case in the late 1990s that forced the company to open up its Windows operating system to competition after it was found guilty of trying to monopolize the browser market. That experience may have factored into the company's recent decision to unbundle its Teams videoconference app from its Office software (though the still-looming threat of EU antitrust action was likely a bigger impetus). He saw Microsoft make failed bets on media players, cell phones, tablets and other technologies. He notices when customers give a piece of their business, however small, to a rival.  But Nadella is perhaps most sensitive to public scrutiny, telling Jeremy that what keeps him up at night is the possibility that his company might lose “its license to operate”—the one that relies on maintaining public trust by being a force for good in the communities in which it operates. Maintaining that license means investing in local economies, as he recently demonstrated with several announcements in Asia. It means figuring out how to meet Microsoft's 2030 goals to become carbon negative when its AI push has sent CO2 emissions up 30% since 2020. And throughout his tenure, it has meant trying to create and sustain a culture that’s humble, hungry and ready to grow. Check out Jeremy’s story here. More news below.

Satya Nadella’s far-sighted bets have made Microsoft a huge success. His biggest fear: that he’ll miss tech’s next big shift,20/5/2024 9:30,Jeremy Kahn20 May 2024 at 2:30 am·27-min read,"Something has caught Satya Nadella’s attention. It’s a small thing—just a five-letter word inside a box, lurking in the corner of a complicated PowerPoint slide, flashed on a screen for a fraction of a second inside a convention hall in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. But it niggles. “You’re doing also Llama? You’re using both?” Nadella asks, a note of surprise in his voice. Llama is the AI model, not the animal. It is a piece of open-source software created by Meta, the social media giant that has pivoted hard to AI and is competing with Microsoft and others to dominate the foundations of the emerging generative AI economy. “Both” is a reference to the fact that this Malaysian agriculture technology company—chosen to show off its use of Microsoft’s technology to Microsoft’s CEO— is using Meta’s rival AI model in addition to GPT-4, the large language model (LLM) created by Microsoft’s strategic partner, OpenAI. Nadella wants his Redmond, Wash.–based software giant to have the most capable, popular AI models on the market. “Um, yep, so we are, we are using Llama also,” says Adrian Lee, the chief technology officer at Agroz, the Malaysian startup, a hint of embarrassment in his reply. Agroz, which builds hydroponic farms, has created an AI chatbot to answer farmers’ questions about how best to tend their lettuce and bok choy.  “What are you using Llama for?” Nadella asks pointedly, standing before Lee at Agroz’s exhibition kiosk. Agroz, Lee explains, eventually wants to use humanoid robots for farming, and the robots may need to operate offline. Some versions of Meta’s Llama model are compact enough to be embedded in robots or phones, unlike the larger GPT-4. “Take a look at Phi,” Nadella says, switching from CEO-as-chief-market-researcher to CEO-as-chief-salesman. Phi is a family of small language models Microsoft has built in-house and offered, like Llama, as open-source software. Nadella apparently knows the parameter count of the smallest Phi model off the top of his head, and he rattles it off—just 3.8 billion parameters, making it small enough to run “on the edge.” Lee says Agroz will experiment with Phi. Meanwhile Agroz’s CEO Gerard Lim offers Nadella some Agroz-grown bok choy. “Oh, you want me to eat it?” Nadella says. He takes a small piece. “Mmmm,” he says, chewing vigorously, and, no doubt, chewing over the lesson about how perilously competitive the AI race is. It’s a telling exchange. Few companies have benefited as much from the generative AI boom as Microsoft. Investor fervor for the technology has helped make Nadella’s company a perennial contender for the title of the world’s most valuable corporation, with a market cap that consistently bobs somewhere in excess of $3 trillion. When Nadella took the reins at Microsoft in 2014, the company was floundering. Under his predecessor, Steve Ballmer, it had missed the smartphone revolution, was lagging on tablets, and was even losing market share in the PC operating system business that made it a household name. Microsoft’s shares had fallen more than 40% during Ballmer’s tenure. In 10-plus years as CEO, Nadella has reinvigorated the company, successfully steering it through two technological transformations: from PCs to the era of cloud computing, and now, to the age of AI. Nadella’s prescient and early bet on OpenAI and its technology, and the fruitful-if-sometimes-tense relationship that ensued, have given Microsoft as good a shot as any company at supremacy in this new era. The company arguably hasn’t been this powerful since it dominated the PC market in the 1990s’ “Wintel” era. But as Nadella begins his second decade at the helm, there’s no guarantee Microsoft will retain its lead. Regulators, hackers, and rivals each present threats serious enough to potentially undermine its industry leadership. Above all, it must reckon with its own leviathan size—and avoid becoming a victim of bureaucracy and bloat when AI’s protean nature calls for speed, agility and finesse.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/satya-nadella-far-sighted-bets-093000489.html,MSFT
"Dow at 40,000: Why stocks still have 'plenty of room to run'",19/5/2024 15:55,Seana Smith·HostUpdated 19 May 2024 at 8:55 am·4-min read,"Investors are catching the bull by the horns. That’s the sentiment gripping Wall Street, as stocks notch record highs and the market is on track for its best month of the year. A late surge in the final stretch of trading pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJIA) to close above 40,000 for the first time ever Friday — a milestone that comes just 874 trading days after the Dow first closed above 30,000. The blue-chip index added 1.2% for the week, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq (^IXIC) both recorded their longest weekly winning streaks since February. “Psychologically it's amusing,” JPMorgan Asset Management’s Jack Manley said of the milestone on Yahoo Finance’s ‘Morning Brief.’ “The rally feels good because the macro data has been pretty good,” he said. Goldman Sachs (GS), Microsoft (MSFT), and UnitedHealth (UNH) were the top three point contributors to the Dow’s charge from 30,000 to 40,000. And the makeup of the Dow looks different than it did during previous milestones. The index most recently replaced Walgreens (WBA) with Amazon (AMZN), bringing it to its current composition. This week’s softer inflation print helped bolster the case for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates before year end, as more investors place their bets on a soft landing. In a note to clients this week, Truist co-chief investment strategist Keith Lerner wrote the recent rally is a “healthy sign and typical characteristic of a bull market,” suggesting “upside potential remains.”",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/dow-at-40000-why-stocks-still-have-plenty-of-room-to-run-160152850.html,MSFT

How China is using AI news anchors to deliver its propaganda,18/5/2024 7:00,Dan Milmo and Amy Hawkins18 May 2024 at 12:00 am·7-min read,"The news presenter has a deeply uncanny air as he delivers a partisan and pejorative message in Mandarin: Taiwan’s outgoing president, Tsai Ing-wen, is as effective as limp spinach, her period in office beset by economic under performance, social problems and protests. “Water spinach looks at water spinach. Turns out that water spinach isn’t just a name,” says the presenter, in an extended metaphor about Tsai being “Hollow Tsai” – a pun related to the Mandarin word for water spinach. This is not a conventional broadcast journalist, even if the lack of impartiality is no longer a shock. The anchor is generated by an artificial intelligence programme, and the segment is trying, albeit clumsily, to influence the Taiwanese presidential election. The source and creator of the video are unknown, but the clip is designed to make voters doubt politicians who want Taiwan to remain at arm’s length from China, which claims that the self-governing island is part of its territory. It is the latest example of a sub-genre of the AI-generated disinformation game: the deepfake news anchor or TV presenter. Such avatars are proliferating on social networks, spreading state-backed propaganda. Experts do say this kind of video will continue to spread as the technology becomes more widely accessible. “It does not need to be perfect,” said Tyler Williams, the director of investigations at Graphika, a disinformation research company. “If a user is just scrolling through X or TikTok, they are not picking up little nuances on a smaller screen.” Beijing has already experimented with AI-generated news anchors. In 2018, the state news agency Xinhua unveiled Qiu Hao, a digital news presenter, who promised to bring viewers the news “24 hours a day, 365 days a year”. Although the Chinese public is generally enthusiastic about the use of digital avatars in the media, Qiu Hao failed to catch on more widely. China is at the forefront of the disinformation element of the trend. Last year, pro-China bot accounts on Facebook and X distributed AI-generated deepfake videos of news anchors representing a fictitious broadcaster called Wolf News. In one clip, the US government was accused of failing to deal with gun violence, while another highlighted China’s role at an international summit. In a report released in April, Microsoft said Chinese state-backed cyber groups had targeted the Taiwanese election with AI-generated disinformation content, including the use of fake news anchors or TV-style presenters. In one clip cited by Microsoft, the AI-generated anchor made unsubstantiated claims about the private life of the ultimately successful pro-sovereignty candidate – Lai Ching-te – alleging he had fathered children outside marriage. Microsoft said the news anchors were created by the CapCut video editing tool, developed by the Chinese company ByteDance, which owns TikTok.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/china-using-ai-news-anchors-070000223.html,MSFT
"Apple’s iPad Pro is its most incredible product, but software holds it back",17/5/2024 19:59,Daniel Howley·Technology EditorUpdated 17 May 2024 at 12:59 pm·4-min read,"Apple’s (AAPL) latest 13-inch iPad Pro is a marvel of engineering. But software still hamstrings the iPad Pro’s true potential, relegating the device to a sleek, high-end package for consuming content rather than allowing the iPad Pro to realize its productivity potential. The company has packed its latest M4 processor with up to 10 CPU and 10 GPU cores, more than you’ll find in its current MacBook Air and at least one version of its MacBook Pro, into a tablet thinner than Apple’s iPod Nano. At just 5.1 millimeters thick, the iPad Pro feels like if you hold it by one end, the other will droop like a piece of loose-leaf paper. It doesn’t, of course. The 11-inch iPad Pro is almost as thin at 5.3 mm. Oh, and then there’s the new Ultra Retina XDR display. Apple says the screen combines two OLED panels to boost its overall brightness while offering the same exceptional benefits you’d get out of a normal OLED display. That means inky blacks and brilliant colors. And all of that is going to cost you. A base 13-inch iPad Pro with Apple’s Magic Keyboard will set you back $1,648. That’s more than a high-end 13-inch MacBook Air and an entry-level MacBook Pro. I could deal with that price, though, if the iPad Pro didn’t have one big setback — iPadOS. Over the years, the iPad has made progress toward offering more Mac-like capabilities. You can run multiple apps at the same time, connect to an external display for a larger workspace, group apps together, and more.

Elon Musk to expand Tesla gigafactory rocked by Left-wing protests,17/5/2024 17:00,James Titcomb17 May 2024 at 10:00 am·40-min read,"Elon Musk’s Tesla has been given the green light to expand its Berlin gigafactory despite environmental activists taking part in huge protests at the plant last week. The local council in Gruenheide, the Brandenburg municipality where the Berlin factory is based, voted 11 to six to allow the company to expand the facility, Tesla’s only European plant. The decision comes three months after local residents voted to block the expansion, which prompted Tesla to submit a scaled-down plan. The referendum was non-binding but the company had promised to revise its plans after the vote. Tesla’s Berlin gigafactory has become a hotspot for environmental and Left-wing protests in recent months, which culminated last week in scores of activists breaking through police lines to reach the walls of the facility. Several weeks earlier, the factory’s power supplies were vandalised, forcing it to stop production. A majority of councillors in Gruenheide voted in favour of the expansion plan, which is roughly half the size of Tesla’s previous proposal to clear around 250 acres of forest. The company hopes to double production to around 1m cars per year. The meeting featured demonstrations outside the local parliament, while those attending the meeting had their bags checked at the door amid a police presence. The expansion will still have to be approved by local environmental regulators and could be subject to legal challenges. It includes connecting the factory to a local train route to ease traffic congestion.

Does Reddit's (RDDT) OpenAI Partnership Make It Worth Buying?,17/5/2024 13:53,Aniruddha Ganguly17 May 2024 at 6:53 am·4-min read,"Reddit RDDT shares jumped 11.74% in after-hours trading on May 16, following the announcement of its partnership with Microsoft MSFT-backed OpenAI.The deal will bring Reddit content to OpenAI’s ChatGPT and other products and, at the same time, will help the social media company incorporate new AI-powered features into its forums. OpenAI will also become Reddit’s advertising partner.Since its initial public offering in March, Reddit shares have gained 22.6%, outperforming the Zacks Internet Software industry and the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector. Reddit’s huge data trove makes it an invaluable source for big techs like Alphabet GOOGL division Google, Amazon AMZN and Microsoft for training their large language models (LLMs). LLMs form the base of Generative AI applications.Generative AI and AI-related startups like OpenAI have attracted close to $50 billion in investments since 2023, affirming the growing interest in the technology and its applications. Microsoft invested close to $13 billion in OpenAI as it sought to gain a front seat in the startup’s AI innovations. Another startup, Anthropic, raised close to $2 billion and $4 billion from investors led by Alphabet’s division Google and Amazon, respectively, as it sought a valuation of close to $30 billion.OpenAI’s GPT-4, Anthropic’s Claude 3 Opus, and Google DeepMind’s Gemini Ultra are the three most capable tools currently available in the Generative AI domain. Reddit Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Reddit Inc. Quote   However, OpenAI and Anthropic are facing increasing competition from their original backers — Microsoft, Amazon and Google, respectively — as these big techs plan to build their own LLMs primarily because these are cheaper to build in-house and they can exercise more control on how to use the models. The OpenAI deal is expected to give them a glimpse of the potency of RDDT’s data in training their models.Reddit’s partnership with Google, which involves training the latter’s LLMs, has been a game changer. An expanded partnership in February this year made it easier for users to find, discover and engage in content and communities on Reddit that are most relevant to them.RDDT is already benefiting from growing data licensing deals as other revenues surged more than 450% year over year to $20 million in the first quarter of 2024. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s prospects are supported by strong ad revenue growth expectations driven by an expanding user base. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Reddit currently has a Zacks Momentum Score of A, which makes it further attractive. Google is playing an important role in expanding its user base as it is getting better at displaying RDDT’s content. In first-quarter 2024, Daily Active Uniques (“DAUq”) increased 37% year over year to 82.7 million. Logged-in DAUq: Global, which RDDT considers as the core metrics of the business, jumped 27% year over year to 43.1 million in the reported quarter.Reddit’s focus on making the platform faster and more user-friendly is noteworthy. It continues to invest in AI and machine learning to improve relevance, engagement and moderation. RDDT plans to deploy its own trained LLMs to improve moderation. These initiatives are expected to drive user engagement.Reddit’s plan to monetize its platform through the launch of a revamped version of user awards and Reddit Gold (its virtual currency) bodes well for its future prospects.Its focus on reducing campaign setup time for self-serve and small and medium businesses (SMBs), as well as the launch of free formats, which provide advertisers with a versatile and creative format to drive deeper engagement with users, is expected to drive ad revenues.Reddit Pro, a free suite of AI-powered insights and tools, is currently in beta with more than 1000 businesses, including Taco Bell, Wendy’s, NFL, the Wall Street Journal, as well as several SMBs. Shopping also remains on the horizon, with RDDT launching shopping ads and testing dynamic product ads. Reddit’s user-friendly and advertiser-friendly focus is a key catalyst. Upcoming user interface improvements, better on-platform search capabilities and monetization plans provide strong growth opportunities. RDDT plans to grow revenues twice as fast as cost growth over the long term, which surely makes the stock attractive for investors at its current level.

Sainsbury’s to work with Microsoft on AI tools to help customers and staff,17/5/2024 13:47,"Martyn Landi, PA Technology Correspondent17 May 2024 at 6:47 am·2-min read","Sainsbury’s has signed a deal with Microsoft to use the technology giant’s artificial intelligence tools to help customers and staff. The supermarket said it will use the technology to create more engaging stores and online shopping experiences for customers, while AI-powered data tools will help staff save time and focus on key tasks. It will use generative AI to create a more interactive online shopping experience, and improve product searches. For staff, Sainsbury’s said they will have access to real-time data for certain key processes, such as shelf replenishment, using AI and cameras on shelf edges to guide workers to the specific items that need restocking – saving time and freeing them up to focus on other priorities. The supermarket added it will also use AI-powered tools to address customer and staff queries. Clodagh Moriarty, Sainsbury’s chief retail and technology officer, said: “Our collaboration with Microsoft will accelerate our ambition to become the UK’s leading AI-enabled grocer. “It’s one of the key ways we’re investing in transforming our capabilities over the next three years, enabling us to take another big leap forward in efficiency and productivity, continue to provide leading customer service, and deliver returns for our shareholders.” Microsoft is one of the biggest companies in the AI space, having created its own AI-powered assistant within its Windows software, Copilot, and is the largest investor in OpenAI, the firm behind ChatGPT. Microsoft is expected to announce a wide range of AI-powered updates when it holds its annual developer conference next week.

UK watchdog decides not to investigate Microsoft's AI partnership with France's Mistral,17/5/2024 13:07,Associated Press Finance17 May 2024 at 6:07 am·1-min read,"LONDON (AP) — British regulators said Friday they don't need to open a competition investigation into Microsoft's partnership with French artificial intelligence company Mistral, a month after asking for industry feedback on the deal. Microsoft announced earlier this year that it was partnering with the buzzy French startup in a move that that could lessen the software giant’s reliance on ChatGPT-maker OpenAI for supplying the next wave of chatbots and other generative AI products. The Competion and Markets Authority said in a brief update that the tie-up “does not qualify for investigation"" under U.K. merger rules. The watchdog had said in April that it was seeking comments from “interested third parties,” before deciding whether to carry out an in-depth antitrust investigation. By deciding not to probe the deal, ""the CMA confirmed that the structure of the partnership between Mistral and Microsoft does not grant sufficient rights/influence to Microsoft,"" Alex Haffner, competition partner at U.K. law firm Fladgate, said by email. The watchdog is still looking into Microsoft's hiring of key staff from another startup, Inflection AI, as well as Amazon’s $4 billion investment in San Francisco-based Anthropic. It didn't provide updates on those reviews, which were announced at the same time last month. Nor has it issued an update on its review of Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI since it asked for comments on that deal in December. The mystery is over: Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a major stake in the insurance company Chubb, finally revealing the investment he has kept under wraps since last year.

Big Tech is pouring billions into British AI investments—but the U.K. risks becoming a sidekick to U.S. tech giants,17/5/2024 12:21,Noel Hurley17 May 2024 at 5:21 am·5-min read,"Microsoft’s plan to open a new AI hub in London is a huge endorsement for the U.K. as a world leader in AI. But I do question whether it is wholly good news for the long-term. The U.K. has shown time and again that some of the very best AI expertise in the world lies here. The pool of talent we have available in this country, the standard of research and development present in our academic institutions, and the U.K.’s (generally) stable economic conditions have, for decades, made our island nation a highly attractive place for tech’s big hitters to lay down roots. That’s why American businesses come here, as well as companies from Japan, China, South Korea, Germany, and Singapore. And recent history highlights the real pedigree we have in software process and design. In a recent interview, Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt declared his wishes for building a “British Microsoft,” warning that such an endeavor would take a decade to materialize. But it wouldn’t be the first time the U.K. has produced a tech titan of its own. I previously spent more than 20 years working at Arm, starting in the 1990s. During this time, the company grew from a small spinout (named Acorn Computers) in Cambridge, to a global tech behemoth. It became, arguably, the largest processor company in the world. This was made possible by talent from the likes of Cambridge, Oxford, UCL, Southampton, Manchester, and many other British academic institutions. We were the world leaders. Another breakthrough moment for U.K. AI was the founding of DeepMind in 2010. It was one of the most exciting AI companies in the world. But DeepMind was then acquired by Google in 2014 for a $400 million (a massive figure at the time). So why is it that with all this talent, our attention seems to constantly be on moves made by companies and capital from overseas, rather than focusing on building and keeping our own tech ventures, and turning them into the world players they could be? The fact that we herald the likes of Microsoft further embedding themselves into the fabric of U.K. tech surely begs the question as to why, as a nation, we haven’t cracked the code for building tech heavyweights of our own. Our universities are very capable of creating spinouts, the funding environment is conducive for raising, and early-stage venture capital is accessible. However, the capital required for these companies to continue growing and being capable of challenging the best tech businesses worldwide simply doesn’t exist. This is a challenge that the U.K. government isn’t yet addressing. We need to ensure that U.K. startups have the ability to scale and remain in the U.K. The goliath-sized funding round raised by U.K. self-driving car technology startup Wayve is a perfect example of this capital tipping point issue in action. The company recently secured $1.05 billion (£840 million) in funding led by Japan’s SoftBank, with Microsoft and Nvidia also participating. This is the largest known investment in an AI company in the U.K.—and more broadly Europe—to date, and it was once again driven by overseas capital.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/big-tech-pouring-billions-british-122143594.html,MSFT

Here's why investors seem to be hesitant to own AMD stock: Mizuho,17/5/2024 10:18,Investing.com17 May 2024 at 3:18 am·2-min read,"Investors are growing increasingly skeptical about owning AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) stock, a Mizuho desk analyst highlighted in a new note. “Why add AMD if I own NVDA and AVGO here that are cheaper and feel much lower risk?” appears to be the key pushback among market participants, the analyst said. The chipmaker’s shares rose to an intraday high of $168 on Thursday, amid a broader surge in the technology sector driven by the recently released softer-than-expected inflation data. It seemed like a short squeeze was affecting much of the tech market, the analyst noted. Notably, AMD’s chipmaking peer Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) Technology was up 6-7% at one point despite the lack of any specific news or events. Meanwhile, AMD remains a significant short position for many East Coast hedge funds, and numerous long-only (LO) investors are steering clear of it ahead of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s Blackwell launch later this year. “Stock feels like a plane crash survivor on a life raft in middle of a massive ocean just looking for land,” the analyst wrote. “I remain a bull and love the risk reward if you have patience and duration (think 6-9 months). But I get the worry, hesitancy and concerns amongst investors.” Mizuho’s expert also said that AMD “could be the next Dell (NYSE:DELL),” another major hedge fund short that surged on a bullish preview from Morgan Stanley ahead of their earnings at the end of May. Meanwhile, new reports suggest that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) plans to promote AMD's MI300X GPUs for generative AI at their upcoming Build conference. While it’s known that Microsoft uses AMD's MI300 GPUs to balance Nvidia, recent negative calls in March and April implied that Microsoft was cutting orders to shift funds to Nvidia’s Blackwell GPUs, set for release later this year. “I would watch AMD today, and while this MSFT news itself is unlikely some major catalyst, any focus by MSFT on AMD’s MI300 next week to me feels like a positive catalyst as the cons view is MSFT will cut MI300 orders this yr and AMD will miss MI300 rev bogeys of $9-10B next yr,” the analyst concluded.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-investors-seem-hesitant-101833984.html,MSFT

Cherney SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Microsoft said on Thursday it plans to offer its cloud computing customers a platform of AMD artificial intelligence chips that will compete with components made by Nvidia, with details to be given at its Build developer conference next week. It will also launch a preview of new Cobalt 100 custom processors at the conference. Microsoft's clusters of Advanced Micro Devices' flagship MI300X AI chips will be sold through its Azure cloud computing service. They will give its customers an alternative to Nvidia's H100 family of powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) which dominate the data center chip market for AI but can be hard to obtain due to high demand. To build AI models or run applications, companies typically must string together - or cluster - multiple GPUs because the data and computation will not fit on a single processor. AMD, which expects $4 billion in AI chip revenue this year, has said the chips are powerful enough to train and run large AI models. As well as Nvidia's top-shelf AI chips, Microsoft's cloud computing unit sells access to its own in-house AI chips called Maia. Separately, the Cobalt 100 processors Microsoft plans to preview next week offer 40% better performance over other processors based on Arm Holdings' technology, the company said.

"Some of the most talented, high-ranking workers at Apple, Microsoft, and SpaceX jumped ship after return-to-office mandates, new study reveals",16/5/2024 16:02,Jane Thier16 May 2024 at 9:02 am·7-min read,"The focus of return-to-office discussions have long focused on the individuals. Why might workers prefer to stay home? Which age groups are most amenable to in-person work, and which are most combative? Does office collaboration make the most sense for creative types or heads-down numbers people? Can workers really be productive left to their own devices? Yet the lingering question of how widespread remote work shapes company outcomes, as well as the wider sector landscape, largely remains unanswered because the whole experiment remains in flux. But a new working paper from researchers at the University of Michigan and University of Chicago, titled “Return to Office and the Tenure Distribution,” comes fairly close to positing an answer: Return-to-office (RTO) mandates, when they’re not wanted, are bad news for companies looking to keep their talent. The researchers matched 260 million resumes to company data to analyze causal effects of RTO mandates on employees’ tenure at Microsoft, SpaceX, and Apple. In scientific terms, they found “a reduction in counterfactual tenure that increases for employees with longer tenure.” In layman’s terms: When the firms enacted RTO mandates, senior employees headed for the door—often to direct competitors—who let them work from home. The number of top-brass employees at Microsoft—as a share of the company headcount—dropped by over 5% post-mandate; at Apple, it was 4%. (Microsoft mandated 50% of the week in-office; Apple, just one day a week.) SpaceX was the worst of the bunch, with a 15% drop, which the researchers chalk up to its uniquely stringent requirement: Five days a week in-person. That human outflow poses an enduring threat to “productivity, innovation, and competitiveness”—the component parts that separate a thriving company from one in freefall. Microsoft’s internal data doesn’t align with the paper’s findings, Amy Coleman, its vice president of human resources and corporate functions, told Fortune via email. The term “return to office mandate” is also inaccurate, she said, adding that Microsoft is a hybrid workplace “that revolves around flexibility and a mix of workstyles across worksite, work location and work hours.” In 2022, Microsoft’s chief human resources officer Kathleen Hogan told Fortune the company considers “working from home up to 50% of the time as standard.” Representatives for Apple and SpaceX did not respond to Fortune’s request for comment, though an Apple spokesperson told the Washington Post that the study drew “inaccurate conclusions” and “does not reflect the realities” of Apple’s business or attrition rates. The statistical analysis came from People Data Labs resumé data, David Van Dijcke, a coauthor and University of Michigan economics PhD student, tells Fortune. “The takeaway is definitely that the effects [of RTO mandates] are more deleterious than people thought before.” Granted, the study is far from all-encompassing; it only studied three major firms, and they were all “early movers” in the RTO push, Van Dijcke acknowledges, pointing to each of their 2022 mandate announcements. That meant senior employees who left Microsoft, Apple, and SpaceX had “pretty good outside options,” namely competing companies that offered remote work with far fewer strings attached. “If we think of Covid as ending in 2022, that was certainly followed by an influx of people claiming they would leave—and then really leaving when the first return-to-office mandates happened,” Anthony Nyberg, a management professor at the University of South Carolina’s Darla Moore School of Business, tells Fortune. “Apple and Microsoft really agonized over how to change their policies—Amazon, too, made many public comments.” To be sure, Nyberg went on, mandating an office return is a major strategic decision—and even in the Michigan study, which found a statistically significant portion of high-earning workers leaving, it remains unclear whether that’s necessarily a bad thing for their former companies. “A big part of this is likely to become a sorting effect in terms of talent finding their best-fit organizations,” Nyberg says. “And people going to competing companies has been a truism for all of eternity.”",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/most-talented-high-ranking-workers-160212454.html,MSFT
"Google, Apple, and Microsoft make their products friendlier to users with disabilities",16/5/2024 14:47,David Meyer16 May 2024 at 7:47 am·3-min read,"It’s Global Accessibility Awareness Day today, and Big Tech firms have accordingly issued a flurry of announcements about how they’ll make their products friendlier to people whose use of devices is hindered by disabilities. Most coverage of Google’s I/O developer event this week may have focused on its generative AI news, but the company also announced an expansion of Project Gameface to the Android platform. Google announced that project last year—it’s an open-source, hands-free gaming “mouse” that uses the webcam to capture the gamer’s head movements and facial gestures, translating them into cursor movements via the magic of machine learning. Now Google is open-sourcing more of the code so developers can make better Android accessibility apps. Gaming may have been the inspiration for Project Gameface—specifically, the needs of a gaming streamer named Lance Carr, who has muscular dystrophy—but the applications clearly go far beyond, with Google promising use cases in educational and work settings too. In a similar vein, Apple yesterday also announced an upcoming iPhone and iPad feature called Eye Tracking. This does what the name suggests, giving users a way to navigate through and activate the elements of an app, just by letting the front-facing camera track their eye movements. Apple also revealed other accessibility features that will be coming soon: Music Haptics, which will help deaf or hard-of-hearing iPhone users experience music with the aid of “taps, textures, and refined vibrations”; Vocal Shortcuts, which will let users trigger complex tasks by uttering simple sounds; and a bunch of new accessibility features specific to the CarPlay and visionOS environments. Meanwhile, on the intriguing-hardware front, we have Microsoft’s announcement yesterday of the Proteus controller for Xbox and PC gamers. Designed by peripherals startup ByoWave, the Proteus is a kit comprising “snap and play” parts that let people customize a wireless controller according to their needs. There’s a “mother cube” that serves as the controller’s brain, a cube features the directional pad, a piece with a mini control stick, another two providing left and right triggers, and so on. There are many possible configurations, from traditional controller layouts to wand-like columns and tabletop-friendly rectangles. Preorders are open now, with the kit ($255 to first-comers, $299 thereafter) shipping in the fall. Microsoft also used the occasion of Global Accessibility Awareness Day to promise fixes for what some gamers with disabilities experienced from a major change that the company made last November when it started blocking the use of unauthorized accessories with the Xbox console. This has been an issue for those who had put together custom controller setups to fit their unique requirements, with equipment coming from small specialist manufacturers that aren’t official Microsoft licensees. Part of Microsoft’s solution is for those manufacturers to get in touch and make their controllers official, but the company is also updating its own Adaptive Controller, which the Xbox always accepts, to expand support for more accessories. The $99 Adaptive Controller is a clever piece of gear that includes some built-in controller functionality of its own, but more importantly acts as a hub for specialized equipment, such as switches that are controlled by biting, sipping, and puffing with the mouth, or with one's feet. “We appreciate and acknowledge that gaming with a disability is highly individualistic, and the solution for one may not be the solution for all,” the company said.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/google-apple-microsoft-products-friendlier-144738151.html,MSFT
How to Boost Your Portfolio with Top Computer and Technology Stocks Set to Beat Earnings,16/5/2024 13:00,Zacks Equity Research16 May 2024 at 6:00 am·2-min read,"Two factors often determine stock prices in the long run: earnings and interest rates. Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter. We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises. 2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist The Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure. The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Nvidia (NVDA) holds a Zacks Rank #1 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $5.68 a share six days away from its upcoming earnings release on May 22, 2024. NVDA has an Earnings ESP figure of 2.9%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $5.68 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.52. NVDA is one of just a large database of Computer and Technology stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Microsoft (MSFT). Microsoft is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on July 23, 2024. MSFT's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $2.90 a share 68 days from its next earnings release. Microsoft's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 0.33% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.89. Because both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, NVDA and MSFT could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/boost-portfolio-top-computer-technology-130004137.html,MSFT

Yes, I know the last year has been all AI every day, but this theme is still early days. Exciting new products built from generative AI models are just beginning to come to market and will continue to change the way we interact with technology. Just this week there were two significant releases from both Microsoft’s, OpenAI and Alphabet. Additionally, now that broad markets have traded sideways for the better part of two months, energy has been built for a major breakout in the leading names. These product releases should be a valuable catalyst for the next big rally. OpenAI introduced the newest iteration of their primary AI model, GPT-4o. The demonstrations of GPT-4o were extremely impressive, with one video showing the AI model interacting with and tutoring a young boy on his math homework. The GPT, young boy and father were all in conversation with each other, and the GPT helped him through the process in a supportive and logical way. It was really something, and I recommend those interested seek out some of the most recent demonstrations released online. Then, at Google I/O, Alphabet’s annual developer conference, the company introduced its newest AI enabled “Agents,” built throughout its platforms. This product is built on Gemini, Alphabet’s response to OpenAI’s GPT. In one demo, the presenter wanted to return a pair of shoes they bought online. They took a picture of them, and said to the agent, “I want to return these shoes, they don’t fit.” Gemini proceeded to find the order info in Gmail, fill out a return form, and scheduled a pickup from UPS. It really functioned like a personal assistant. The presentation also showed Gemini agents planning detailed trips catered to specific interests, summarizing long email chains, and working across multiple external websites to really simplify workflow. Again, I recommend those interested go watch the demo videos.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-investment-ideas-feature-highlights-095200168.html,MSFT

Berkshire revealed it acquired nearly 26 million shares of Chubb in a Wednesday Securities and Exchange Commission filing of the company’s first-quarter investments. That translates to a value of approximately $6.7bn (£5.28bn). Berkshire had requested confidential treatment from the Securities and Exchange Commission in the third and fourth quarter of last year for one or more of its equity holdings. The treatment was sought presumably because Buffett wanted to accumulate Chubb without tipping off other investors and potentially boosting the price of Chubb shares.

D.C. is testing its Big Tech antitrust campaign far from D.C.,16/5/2024 8:00,Alexis Keenan·Reporter16 May 2024 at 1:00 am·6-min read,"The Biden administration is testing its antitrust push far from Washington as it seeks to unwind the dominance of Big Tech. No longer is the nation’s capital the go-to trial venue of choice for the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission as they file competition challenges against the biggest names in Silicon Valley. Instead, it’s New Jersey where the government chose to sue Apple (AAPL). Or California, where it challenged Microsoft (MSFT). Or the state of Washington, where it confronted Amazon (AMZN). Or Virginia, where it filed a second antitrust suit against Google (GOOG, GOOGL). ""They’re clearly filing these tech cases in different jurisdictions where the law is less developed,"" said Douglas Ross, a professor of antitrust at the University of Washington School of Law. ""And they're doing it for a reason."" A variety of strategies could explain the multi-jurisdictional approach, according to antitrust lawyers. Prosecutors could be targeting appeals courts with case law more favorable to their legal theories, since all of the district courts selected by Biden’s FTC and DOJ report to different courts of appeals. The government could also be weighing the speed of a court in handling litigation and the convenience to anticipated witnesses, said Juan Arteaga, a partner with Crowell & Moring’s antitrust litigation division. It’s also possible, he added, that government officials may want to showcase vigorous anticompetitive enforcement to the rest of the country. ""I think the current leadership team and the DOJ antitrust division have really made it a point to try to take antitrust enforcement out of the D.C. bubble,"" Arteaga said.

On Tuesday, the company announced a flurry of AI products and services during its I/O developer conference with the aim of repositioning itself as the world’s AI software leader. “We are fully in our Gemini era,” CEO Sundar Pichai said during his keynote, referring to the company’s latest Gemini AI models, while noting that AI is still “in the very early days of the AI platform shift.” For years, Google was considered Silicon Valley’s AI powerhouse. But OpenAI and Microsoft (MSFT) threw the company off course, entering into a multibillion-dollar, multiyear partnership in 2023 that saw Microsoft integrate OpenAI’s most advanced models into its productivity, search, and cloud products. All this helped crown Microsoft as the world’s most valuable company earlier this year. Google’s climb back hasn’t been easy. It originally debuted a ChatGPT competitor called Bard that fell short of initial expectations. And more recently, it bungled the rollout of its generative AI-powered image generator, a tool that the company admitted was not “working the way we intended.” Stealing back the AI throne starts with Google reinventing its most important product: Search. Now — or soon, as it’s rolling out over time — at the top of the screen, you’ll find a generative AI-powered area called AI Overview that offers summarized responses to queries along with links to the sources. It’s a major departure for Google and could impact everything from the company’s advertisers, its main source of revenue, to websites that rely on the firm for search traffic, such as travel platforms and media organizations. While the Search changes are easily the biggest updates to Google’s public-facing products, they weren’t the only consequential announcements at the show. Google also showed off a new AI-powered prototype assistant called Project Astra. During a pre-recorded stage demo, the platform, which views content streamed through your smartphone camera, was able to identify objects, solve programming problems, and more.

Tanking Profit Overshadowed Alibaba's AI Growth And Reignited Domestic E-Commerce,15/5/2024 15:05,Upwallstreet15 May 2024 at 8:05 am·3-min read,"On Tuesday, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA) reported its net profit took quite a dive during the fiscal fourth quarter, after already having a hard time throughout 2023 as it underwent its largest-ever corporate restructuring. For the quarter ended on March 31st, Alibaba posted revenue grew 7% YoY to 221.9 billion yuan, which amounts $30.7 billion, as it boosted domestic e-commerce sales. But, Alibaba reported its net income attributable to ordinary shareholders tanked as much as 86% YoY to 3.27 billion yuan, which is about $452 million, attributing the poor result to a net loss from investments in publicly-traded companies, compared to last year’s quarter when it made a net gain. Early signs of reignited e-commerce growth. Although Alibaba is still grappling with cautious consumers in China amid the economic slowdown, its core e-commerce business has improved due to its focus on low-cost goods. Taobao and Tmall division that represent its e-commerce segment reported 4% YoY growth to 93.2 billion yuan, accelerating from previous quarter’s 2% growth. Customer management revenue which consists of sales received from services such as marketing that merchants get from Alibaba, reported 5% YoY growth, also improving from being flat in the previous quarter. International commerce business grew 45% YoY 27.4 billion yuan. Cloud growth fails to impress, but AI rose to the task. The cloud computing division is having a hard time to shine. Last year, Alibaba decided not proceed with the spinoff of the division that competes with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) AWS and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL)-owned Google Cloud. For the reported quarter, Cloud computing brought in 25.6 billion yuan to the revenue table, posting the same growth rate of 3% YoY from the previous quarter. However, AI-related revenue reported a triple-digit YoY growth. AI-revenue came from various sectors, including foundational model companies, internet companies, financial services and the automotive industry. On Monday, Microsoft-backed OpenAI launched its new AI model, GPT-4o. Through a livestreamed event, Microsoft-backed OpenAI demonstrated its latest effort of expanding the use of its chatbot and improving its capabilities as it made a significant step when it comes to ease of use. Microsoft-backed Open AI demonstrated the capabilities of the new model that is able to even perceive the user’s emotion, help calm a user down before making a public speech as well as read a story in a different tone or even sing it.

"Workers heading back to the office on Mondays, caterer Compass says",15/5/2024 12:18,Yadarisa Shabong15 May 2024 at 5:18 am·1-min read,"By Yadarisa Shabong May 15 (Reuters) - Mondays are now as busy as Thursdays in office canteens in the United States and Britain, the world's largest food catering firm Compass Group said on Wednesday. Compass, which caters to staff at companies such as Microsoft and Shell, raised its annual profit forecast on Wednesday after its half-year ended March benefited from more workers returning to offices. Many global companies including Microsoft, Amazon and Apple have hybrid working policies where employees are required to be in the office for part of the working week. Companies are trying to lure back staff using incentives such as free or subsidised food after the COVID-19 pandemic dramatically changed the way people worked. Initially, workers had been reluctant to return to the office on days either side of the weekend. But Mondays have become busier across all markets and particularly in Britain and the United States, a Compass spokesperson said. Cost-conscious workers are also spending more in office canteens rather than in high street restaurants, where prices have risen sharply. That has compensated for a decline in overall footfall, CEO Dominic Blakemore told analysts. Fridays remain the quietest day of the week in terms of footfall, although that day has the highest average transaction spend based on fewer people, the spokesperson added.

5 Most Powerful Countries in the World by Economy,14/5/2024 17:56,Talha Qureshi14 May 2024 at 10:56 am·6-min read,"In this article, we will look at the 5 Most Powerful Countries in the World by Economy. The United States of America, China, and Germany are some of the most powerful countries in the world by economy. Factors including strong GDP growth, low inflation rates, increased employment opportunities, and strong investment determine a country’s economic power. In addition to these factors, the overall world economic outlook also contributes to the economic performance of these countries. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) April 2024 update, the world economy grew at 3.2% in 2023 and is forecasted to continue growing at the same rate in 2024 and 2025. The advanced economies of the world are expected to witness a slight increase in growth rate and are forecasted to grow at 1.7% in 2024 as compared to a 1.6% growth rate in 2023. On the other hand, growth for emerging and developing economies is expected to slow down modestly from 4.3% in 2023 to 4.2% in 2024. Global headline inflation is easing and was close to the pre-pandemic level in late 2023 for most economies. During the last quarter of 2023, headline inflation was recorded to be 2.3% down from 9.5% in the second quarter of 2022 in a quarter-wise analysis. While headline inflation for emerging and developing countries has also cooled down from its peak of 13.7% in the first quarter of 2022, it is still considerably high and was recorded at 9.9% in the last quarter of 2023. The mean inflation rate for developing countries is high due to uncontrolled inflation in some countries. For instance, on May 3rd, Reuters reported that annual consumer price inflation in Turkey climbed up by 69.8% in April, the rise was still below expectations, however, it was the highest since late 2022. The Finance Minister of Turkey, Mehmet Simsek, said that though inflation will peak in May, it will start to ease sharply to be in line with the government's prediction.

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Saudi Arabian Oil Company (TADAWUL:2222) are two of the leading companies leading the global economy. Let's discuss some updates from them. On May 8th, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced $3.3 billion in Wisconsin to strengthen artificial intelligence economic activity, innovation, and job creation. The investment package is designed to upgrade Southeast Wisconsin as a hub of cloud computing, and will also lead to the building of the country's first manufacturing-focused Artificial innovation lab. Moreover, the initiative also aims to address the skill gap within the state and will help equip over 100,000 residents with essential AI skills. The president of the United States, Joe Biden along with the president of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Brad Smith announced this new investment package at Gateway Technical College. Saudi Arabian Oil Company (TADAWUL:2222) is an integrated energy and chemical company based in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia with operations running internationally. The company operates in the upstream and downstream segments and deals with the exploration, development, and production, of hydrocarbon products, and other related chemicals. On April 27th Saudi Arabian Oil Company (TADAWUL:2222) announced that it is exploring a joint venture in its Saudi Aramco Jubail Refinery Company with its Chinese partner Rongsheng Petrochemical Co., Ltd. (SHE:002493) as a new downstream partner. Saudi Arabian Oil Company (TADAWUL:2222) recently signed a cooperation framework agreement that envisions Rongsheng Petrochemical Co., Ltd. (SHE:002493) acquiring 50% of the stake in the Saudi Aramco Jubail Refinery Company. The agreement also lays the foundation for the development of liquid-to-chemical expansion projects at the refinery. The Aramco Downstream President, Mohammed Y. Al Qahtani, said that this partnership is a step towards key geographical expansions and to attract investment in the Saudi downstream sector. With that, let’s look at some of the most powerful countries in the world by economy. 5 Most Powerful Countries in the World by Economy Our Methodology To create the list of 5 most powerful countries in the world by economy, we relied on four main economic indicators including GDP at current prices, real GDP growth rates, GDP per capita (PPP), and GDP per capita growth rates, all sourced from IMF. We used the GDP at current prices as our primary metric to rank the countries. GDP is one of the most commonly used single measures to gauge a country’s overall economic activity and represent the total value of all the final goods and services produced within a country during a year. We have used recent data for 2024 for all of our indicators. The list is arranged in ascending order of countries' GDP.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/5-most-powerful-countries-world-175638657.html,MSFT
"Google debuts a slew of generative AI features as fight with rivals OpenAI, Microsoft, and Apple heats up",14/5/2024 17:56,Daniel Howley·Technology Editor14 May 2024 at 10:56 am·4-min read,"Google (GOOG, GOOGL) unveiled a slew of generative AI products at its Google I/O developer conference on Tuesday, including its Gemini Live assistant, updates for its Android and Workspaces platforms, and an overhaul of its flagship Search product. The announcements are part of Google’s broader effort to reestablish itself as Silicon Valley’s AI leader after it was caught off guard by Microsoft’s (MSFT) partnership with OpenAI in 2022. The new products also come a day after OpenAI unveiled its GPT-4o AI model and days before rivals Microsoft and Apple (AAPL) debut their own major generative AI updates. The biggest announcement is that Google is updating its Search platform to include generative AI results at the top of the screen. The feature, which was originally available as part of a preview in the company's Search Labs, is now coming to all US users and rolling out globally in the coming future. Another one of the biggest announcements was a new, personalized AI assistant called Gemini Live. The feature, powered by the company’s Gemini 1.5 Pro model, will allow you to speak directly to the assistant on your mobile device, providing you with responses in a number of natural-sounding voices. On the Android front, Google says it's expanding the assistant to interact with apps like Google Messages and Gmail, allowing users, for example, to drag and drop generated images from Gemini into texts and emails. Users can also use the app to ask specific questions about YouTube videos, and it will scour the video's captions to find an answer. Google is also updating its on-device version of Gemini, called Gemini Nano, with new multimodal features. Multimodal means that a generative AI model can work across mediums including text, images, and video. Google’s vice president of engineering for Gemini experiences, Amar Subramanya, told Yahoo Finance he’s been using Gemini Live for brainstorming, bouncing ideas off of the assistant. Subramanya said early testers have also been using Gemini Live for scenarios including translation. In the coming months, Google says Gemini Live will be able to access a user's cameras, allowing the assistant to interact with the real world and things it sees. OpenAI has also shown off these capabilities in demos of its GPT-4o. In one example, Subramanya said he asked the assistant to find a recipe for a pineapple upside-down cake for 15 people and add the ingredients to his Keep shopping list. The assistant found a recipe for eight people, scaled the proportions from eight to 15 people, and put the items Subramanya needed to put it together into his shopping list.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/google-debuts-a-slew-of-generative-ai-features-as-fight-with-rivals-openai-microsoft-and-apple-heats-up-175635303.html,MSFT

The company will roll out its generative AI updates to US users beginning today and more than a billion people worldwide by the end of the year. The announcement, as part of Google’s I/O developer conference, brings a new look to Search via its AI Overview. The feature provides a brief, AI-generated answer to searches, coupled with a series of links to the sources cited in the response. Google is also working on answering more complex answers via an update in Search Labs — which offers users the ability to test upcoming capabilities. The company says you'll be able to search for a yoga or Pilates studio in Boston that offers discounts to new members and how far it is from Beacon Hill, and Search will provide an answer without you having to perform multiple searches. It will also allow you to do things like look for meal plans for a group or put together a vacation itinerary. There is also a new video search option coming to Search Labs, which enables users to take a video and use it as a search prompt. In one example, the company says a user dealing with a problem related to a record player arm would be able to take a video of the issue, and Search would be able to provide an AI Overview explanation of the malfunction and how to address it. But don’t expect this multistep or video search to be available today. Google said it’s coming to its Search Labs soon and will only be available for English queries in the US for now. I’ve been using AI Overview, and it's been a helpful addition to Search, whether I was looking for information about obscure video games from the 1990s or about how to treat a foot injury.

Microsoft is investing billions in AI. Here’s how it’s using the technology within its own HR ranks,14/5/2024 12:25,Emma Burleigh14 May 2024 at 5:25 am·3-min read,"Good morning! The AI revolution is upon us, and CHROs across the world are scrambling to figure out how to integrate the new technology into their companies. It can be used to optimize everything from screening résumés to interviewing candidates, and it's on its way to becoming the new super tool for managers everywhere—if they learn how to implement it in a meaningful way. Microsoft is one of the biggest players in the AI space, thanks to big bets early on and pouring billions into OpenAI, among other investments. But the company has also been tasked with rolling out the technology within its own workforce of more than 200,000 employees. And a recent LinkedIn post from Christopher J. Fernandez, Microsoft’s VP of human resources, provides an insight into what they’ve been up to so far. Fernandez writes that Microsoft’s “human-centered approach,” based on the company’s responsible AI tenants, has been key; those include accountability, inclusiveness, reliability and safety, fairness, transparency, and privacy and security. “The principles have guided every decision our HR team has made related to the implementation of first- and third-party AI solutions,” he writes. He also highlights that HR workers don’t need computer engineering degrees to be key players in the AI metamorphosis of corporate America. “The adoption and transformation journey I and my team have been on proves you need not be a technologist to drive material digital transformation and AI adoption in your organization,” he writes. To that end, Microsoft trained and empowered HR employees to become “citizen developers” for their own AI needs via a platform that did not require advanced coding skills. That allowed Microsoft HR workers to build their own AI applications and custom tools to transform operations and automate tedious processes. One such creation was the HR Virtual Agent, an AI-powered HR bot that answered routine employee questions about benefits and workplace issues, and led to a productivity gain of around 160,000 hours for HR service advisors. In another instance, HR workers built upon an existing generative AI product to create the Copilot in Dynamics 365 Customer Service AI application, a case management tool which was rolled out to the company’s global HR service centers this year. It has led to a 26% faster response rate to initial HR inquiries, and a 7% reduction in case resolution time. Fernandez writes that the company’s workers overall have had higher job satisfaction and an optimized employee experience because of HR’s foray into AI. HR workers using Copilot Dynamics 365 Customer Service were 16% more likely to say they enjoyed their job. And looking forward, Microsoft will continue to leverage AI in the HR function. “Jobs will change and evolve with AI, as has been the case with all technological advancements in history,” he writes. “We cannot predict what the future holds, but we can be the ones to shape our future with AI.” Emma Burleighemma.burleigh@fortune.com",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-investing-billions-ai-using-122512702.html,MSFT
"The Gates Foundation is losing its smarter half, Warren Buffett says",14/5/2024 11:59,"Samantha Delouya, CNN14 May 2024 at 4:59 am·4-min read","On Monday, Melinda French Gates announced her resignation from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, officially ending one of the world’s leading philanthropic partnerships. If you ask Warren Buffett, the foundation is losing its smarter half. In a 2008 Fortune profile, the Berkshire Hathaway CEO said French Gates helped focus the foundation’s mission. “He’s smart as hell, obviously,” Buffett said of Microsoft cofounder and former CEO Bill Gates. “But in terms of seeing the whole picture, she’s smarter,” referring to French Gates. French Gates’ departure marks the end of an era for the 24-year-old foundation, which she cofounded with her ex-husband, Bill Gates “This is not a decision I came to lightly,” French Gates said in a statement on social media, announcing that her last day of work would be June 7. Since its founding in 2000, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has grown into one of the world’s largest private charitable organizations, paying out a total of $77.6 billion in grants through the end of 2023. In her departure announcement, French Gates said she plans to continue her philanthropic work independently, focusing on issues affecting women and girls in the United States and around the world. Here’s how she became one of the world’s preeminent philanthropists. French Gates started her career at Microsoft, where she was hired after graduating from Duke University, according to a 2008 profile in Fortune Magazine. She began her philanthropic life in 1997, one year after she left her job at Microsoft, cofounding the Gates Library Foundation with her then-husband, Bill Gates. The foundation’s mission was to help US public libraries offer free internet access, according to the Bill and Melinda Gates’ Foundation’s website. That foundation was a precursor to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which officially launched in 2000 with a focus on global health, science and education.

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 73% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company. Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute. In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Microsoft.  Check out our latest analysis for Microsoft  Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing. We can see that Microsoft does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Microsoft, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Microsoft. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.0% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.3% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.0% of the company stock.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/73-ownership-shares-microsoft-corporation-110021747.html,MSFT

Investors Heavily Search Microsoft Corporation (MSFT): Here is What You Need to Know,13/5/2024 13:00,Zacks Equity Research13 May 2024 at 6:00 am·5-min read,"Microsoft (MSFT) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock. Shares of this software maker have returned -1.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.3% change. The Zacks Computer - Software industry, to which Microsoft belongs, has lost 2.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term? Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision. Revisions to Earnings Estimates Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings. We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. Microsoft is expected to post earnings of $2.89 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.2%. The consensus earnings estimate of $11.76 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +19.9%. This estimate has changed +1.3% over the last 30 days. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $13.19 indicates a change of +12.1% from what Microsoft is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%. Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Microsoft is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-microsoft-corporation-130014506.html,MSFT
"France bags $16 billion investment boost from Microsoft, Pfizer and others as Macron goes on FDI charm offensive",13/5/2024 11:30,Prarthana Prakash13 May 2024 at 4:30 am·3-min read,"It’s been a solid start to the week for France. Officials announced today that the country has bagged €15 billion ($16.2 billion) in investments from multinational companies ranging from tech to pharmaceuticals, helping bolster its business landscape. Microsoft, Amazon, Morgan Stanley, Sanofi and more are planning to pump investments into their French businesses as part of President Emmanuel Macron’s “Choose France” summit on Monday. This is a serious amount to announce in one day, even for a country that typically receives substantial foreign direct investment (FDI), like France. To put it in perspective, in 2022, which was a particularly strong year, the country received $36.4 billion FDI inflow in 2022, according to the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). The Choose France event, now in its seventh year, positions France as a leading hub for global business. This year, in one of its most significant FDI announcements, a total of 56 projects were added. Microsoft, for instance, has committed €4 billion ($4.3 billion) to build its cloud and AI capabilities to train a million people and help 2,500 startups grow over the next three years. Fellow tech giant Amazon also unveiled new investments worth $1.3 billion. French pharma company Sanofi has plowed €1 billion ($1 billion) into the country to expand drug production. Its peers Pfizer and AstraZeneca also said they’d invest close to $1 billion in France. “This new investment will create more than 500 jobs and significantly strengthen France’s ability to control the production of essential medicines from start to finish, for the present day and into the future,” Sanofi said in a statement Monday.

15 Jobs That Will Be in Demand in 2030,12/5/2024 14:29,Afifa Mushtaque12 May 2024 at 7:29 am·9-min read,"In this article, we will look at the 15 jobs that will be in demand in 2030. We have also talked about the role of AI in hiring and jobs in general. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Jobs That Will Be in Demand in 2030. In April 2024, nearly 65,000 individuals in the US lost their jobs which is 90,000 less job cuts observed in March and a slight dip from April 2023’s 66,995 cuts. The technology sector continued to witness layoffs as Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) announced a major reduction of approximately 14,000 employees which was about 10% of its workforce. It is interesting to note that automotive sector was the sector with the highest number of job cuts last month as automakers slashed over 20,000 jobs in 2024, twice the number cut by April 2023. Of the overall job cuts, 800 were attributed to AI. Despite this, employers announced plans to hire nearly 9,802 new workers in April. However, even with the sluggish hiring trends, the unemployment rate has remained relatively stable over the past year. In March, the average duration of unemployment was 5 months, compared to 4.4 months in the same period of 2023, with the unemployment rate at 3.8%, expected to rise slightly to 3.9%. Despite concerns over job losses, the unemployment rate has not exceeded 4% in 26 consecutive months, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. To read more about unemployment, see 20 States with the Highest Unemployment Rates. Speaking of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), apart from observing thousands of job cuts, it is also opting for a hiring freeze across North America. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s job board that once had over 3,400 positions, now displays just three opportunities for its manufacturing development program. Moreover, the 2024 Annual Work Trend Index by Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and LinkedIn has confimed the growing role of AI in the global employment trends. Surveying 31,000 individuals across 31 countries, the report highlighted that employers have a preference for candidates with AI expertise over those with traditional experience. Remarkably, 71% of leaders now prioritize hiring candidates with AI skills. Given the growing invasion of AI in different sectors, there will be jobs that will disappear by 2030 like administration legal assistants. Despite the increasing demand for AI skills, there's a stark discrepancy in training initiatives. While 66% of leaders insist on AI proficiency for new hires, only 25% of firms plan to provide training in generative AI this year. This gap suggests a growing advantage for younger applicants, as employers broaden their talent search to encompass those with AI acumen beyond their organizations. Consequently, Gen Zers with AI expertise not only secure prime positions but also experience accelerated career growth as 77% of leaders intend to delegate increased responsibilities to early-career hires proficient in AI.

20 Best AI Content Detectors in 2024,11/5/2024 22:32,Talha Qureshi11 May 2024 at 3:32 pm·12-min read,"In this article, we will look at the 20 best AI content detectors in 2024. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Best AI Content Detectors in 2024. Content Marketing is a dynamic strategy that utilizes digital tools including text, images, videos, audio, and infographics to market content and services and retain potential audiences. According to a report by Mordor Intelligence, the global content marketing industry is expected to reach $263.09 billion in 2024. The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 14.75% during the forecasted period to reach $523.45 billion by 2029. Two of the leading factors driving growth in the industry are; the growing demand for digital transformation and online presence for business and the rise of AI-based content marketing. The global content marketing industry was revolutionized in 2022 due to the release of ChatGPT by OpenAI on November 30, 2022. ChatGPT is a large language model that uses Natural Language Processing (NPL) to produce human-like dialogue form responses to user's requests. The platform immediately gained attention and was used by over a million people during the first 5 days of its release. The number of ChatGPT users has increased drastically. According to the results from Similarweb recorded on 10th May 2024, the platform was visited by 1.8 billion people during the past 28 days. The release of ChatGPT by OpenAI led other leading technology companies to develop and release their language models. Subsequently, Gemini, Copilot, and Ernie were released by Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU), respectively. These platforms have fostered growth in the AI content creation tool market. According to a report by Future Market Insights, the AI content creation tools market was valued at $840.3 million in 2024. The market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 13.60% during the forecasted period to reach $3.01 billion by 2034. Looking at country-wise growth rates, the United States market is expected to grow at the fastest CAGR of 10.5% mainly due to its highly digitized economy and a wide range of businesses with a growing online presence.

The release of AI content generators threatened the jobs of content writers, journalists, and others associated with the industry. However, the world soon realized the limitations and potential issues linked to AI-generated content. The content generated using artificial intelligence software is redundant, based on hallucinated facts or imagined facts, spammy, and mostly plagiarized. On February 8, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) released its policy about AI-generated content stating that the appropriate use of AI or automation is not against Google’s policies, however content generated to spam and manipulate the search engine ranking is against Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) spam policy and will be penalized. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are two of the leading tech companies developing AI content generators. If you want to read more about AI companies you can look at 16 Biggest Publicly Traded AI Companies in the World. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is the developer of the large language model, Gemini. On February 22, Reuters reported that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) paused image generation at its AI platform Gemini due to inaccurate results for some historical depictions. Google started offering image generation using generative AI technology through Gemini during the initial days of February 2024. The tool was updated and on February 26th Google reported that it planned to relaunch the tool after fixing it. Here are some comments related to Gemini from Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Q1 2024 earnings call: ""The teams are making rapid progress, developing Gemini and other models. In February, we rolled out Gemini 1.5 Pro, which shows dramatic performance enhancements across a number of dimensions. It includes a breakthrough in long context understanding, achieving the longest context window of any large -scale foundation model yet. Combining this with Gemini’s native multimodal understanding across audio, video, text code, and more, it’s highly capable. We are already seeing developers and enterprise customers enthusiastically embrace Gemini 1.5 and use it for a wide range of things. Beyond Gemini, we have built other useful models, including our Gemma open models, as well as imagine visual models and others. Second, infrastructure leadership. We have the best infrastructure for the AI era."" Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is another leading technology company and the maker of Copilot, a large language model-based AI Chatbot. On March 30, Reuters reported that the US Congress has banned its staff from using Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) AI Copilot due to the risk of leaking data to non-House approved cloud servers. In response, the Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has announced a roadmap for its AI tools that meet the federal government’s security criteria and is intended to be delivered later this year. Moreover, over the last two years, two Democratic and two Republican senators have introduced legislation to ban the use of AI that creates false content depicting candidates related to federal election campaigns.

The advertising and marketing industry is a vital component of the economy and it plays diverse roles in driving growth, nurturing innovation and creativity, and facilitating market efficiency. According to a report by Solomon Partners, the projections indicate that global advertising growth for 2024 is expected to range from 4.6% to 7.2%, nearly doubling the anticipated growth rate of 2% to 5% projected for 2023. Some of the major growth catalysts in the year for marketing and advertising companies are the Paris Olympics and the US elections. According to the report, the highest ad spending year-over-year growth is expected for out-of-home advertising at 7.2%, followed by digital ad spending at 6.3%. On the other hand, print ad spending is expected to decline by 4.6% year-over-year. In recent weeks, companies with digital advertisement segments saw a healthy rise in their ad revenues. Mega-cap tech stocks such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) beat their estimates and experienced a significant rise in their advertisement businesses. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) reported its earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, on April 24, posting an EPS of $4.71, up $0.39 from forecasts.

(NASDAQ:META) reported that the number of ad impressions delivered across its Family of Apps increased by 20%, compared to the previous year and the average price per ad was up 6% year-over-year. Nearly 98% of the company’s revenue comes from advertisements. At its Q1 2024 earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg made the following comments about integrating AI with its ad business: “...once our new AI services reach scale, we have a strong track record of monetizing them effectively. There are several ways to build a massive business here, including scaling business messaging, introducing ads or paid content into AI interactions, and enabling people to pay to use bigger AI models and access more compute. And on top of those, AI is already helping us improve app engagement which naturally leads to seeing more ads, and improving ads directly to deliver more value. So if the technology and products evolve in the way that we hope, each of those will unlock massive amounts of value for people and business for us over time.” Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) posted its earnings for the fiscal first quarter of 2024 on April 25 and reported an EPS of $1.89, exceeding EPS estimates by $0.38. The company's revenue was up 15.4% year-over-year at $80.54 billion. The company’s Google advertising segment reported revenues of $61.66 billion, showing an increase of over 13% year-over-year. Furthermore, YouTube ads generated a revenue of $8.09 billion, compared to $6.693 billion in the first quarter of 2023. Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) CEO, Sundar Pichai made the following comments at the company’s Q1 2024 earnings call: “We remain committed to all of this work. Finally, our monetization path. We have clear paths to AI monetization through ads and cloud, as well as subscriptions. Philip will talk more about new AI features that are helping advertisers, including bringing Gemini models into Performance Max. Our Cloud business continues to grow as we bring the best of Google AI to enterprise customers and organizations around the world. And Google One now has crossed 100 million paid subscribers. And in Q1, we introduced a new AI premium plan with Gemini Advanced. Okay, those are the six points. So now let me turn to quarterly highlights from Cloud and YouTube in a bit more detail. In Cloud, we have announced more than 1,000 new products and features over the past eight months.” While the above-mentioned companies generate most of their revenues from advertising and marketing, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is an e-commerce company. However, its ad revenue experienced the most noteworthy jump. On April 30, the company reported earnings for the fiscal first quarter of 2024. Amazon.com, Inc.

Here is what Amazon.com, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) CEO, Andy Jassy said about its advertising business at the company’s Q1 2024 earnings call: “The strength in advertising was primarily driven by sponsored products, supported by continued improvements in relevancy and measurement capabilities for advertisers. We still see significant opportunity ahead in our sponsored products as well as areas where we’re just getting started like Prime Video ads.

It’s very early for streaming TV ads but we’re encouraged by the early response. Moving to AWS. Year-over-year revenue growth accelerated to 17.2% in Q1, up from 13.2% in Q4.

Microsoft hit with $242 million US verdict in Cortana patent lawsuit,10/5/2024 21:13,Blake Brittain10 May 2024 at 2:13 pm·1-min read,"By Blake Brittain (Reuters) - Microsoft must pay patent owner IPA Technologies $242 million, a federal jury in Delaware said on Friday after determining that Microsoft's Cortana virtual-assistant software infringed an IPA patent. The jury agreed with IPA after a week-long trial that Microsoft's voice-recognition technology violates IPA's patent rights in computer-communications software. IPA is a subsidiary of patent-licensing company Wi-LAN, which is jointly owned by Canadian technology company Quarterhill and two investment firms. It bought the patent and others from SRI International's Siri Inc, which Apple acquired in 2010 and whose technology it used in its Siri virtual assistant. ""We remain confident that Microsoft never infringed on IPA's patents and will appeal,"" a Microsoft spokesperson said. Representatives for IPA and Wi-LAN did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the verdict. IPA filed the lawsuit in 2018, accusing Microsoft of infringing patents related to personal digital assistants and voice-based data navigation. The case was later narrowed to concern one IPA patent. Microsoft argued that it does not infringe and that the patent is invalid. IPA has also sued Google and Amazon over its patents. Amazon defeated IPA's lawsuit in 2021, and the Google case is still ongoing.

"With Apple entering the fight, the AI chip wars have gone nuclear",10/5/2024 15:05,Daniel Howley·Technology Editor10 May 2024 at 8:05 am·4-min read,"The artificial intelligence (AI) chip wars have officially kicked into high gear. On Tuesday, Apple (AAPL) unveiled its latest iPad Pro lineup, complete with the company’s all-new M4 chip. The processor, Apple says, features a 50% faster CPU than the prior generation Pro’s M2 chip, as well as a GPU with four times the performance of its predecessor. But Apple focused most on the M4’s neural engine, the portion of the chip dedicated to running AI applications. According to the company, the neural engine in the M4 is the company’s fastest yet, and it's more powerful than any neural processing unit available on today’s AI PCs. That might all seem like Apple puffing out its chest at the competition, and it is to a degree. But it also shows we’re entering a new era of PC marketing focused on the promise of generative AI applications running directly on our machines, rather than in the cloud. Microsoft (MSFT) is already pushing the category of AI PCs along with Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), Qualcomm (QCOM), and Nvidia (NVDA), and with Apple entering the fray, the battle over which company is the new AI champ has officially begun. The AI PC, or in the case of Apple AI iPad or AI Mac, is meant to be able to run smaller versions of the kinds of large language models that power apps like ChatGPT, Microsoft’s Copilot, and Google’s Gemini. In fact, Google (GOOG, GOOGL) already runs a version of its Gemini model called Gemini Nano on its Pixel smartphones. AI PCs are, generally, PCs that include neural processing units (NPUs), or in Apple’s case, a neural engine. These are essentially portions of a chip dedicated to powering AI applications. Intel’s Core Ultra chips, which it debuted in December, feature their own NPUs, while AMD has been showing off chips with its XDNA AI engine since May 2023. Qualcomm, for its part, has also joined the fight with its Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus chips. All of these chips should end up in Windows PCs on store shelves by the end of the year. Microsoft is already banking on AI PCs being a runaway success, going so far as to introduce a Windows keyboard button dedicated to its AI-powered Copilot software. It’s the first new keyboard button in nearly 30 years. Apple, on the other hand, has been building its neural engine into its chips since it launched its A11 processor in the iPhone X in 2017. The company has regularly touted its neural engine’s capabilities throughout the years, but the debut of the M4 chip marked the first time Apple started throwing out key performance metrics.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to 5 Biggest Publicly Traded AI Companies in the World. On May 8, Stuart Kaiser, Citi's Head of Equity Trading Strategy, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance where he discussed the role of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in shaping the market for artificial intelligence. Kaiser suggests that the company's earnings report may be the biggest event to look forward to right now, especially for equity holders, according to the S&P 500 index. He also highlighted that if the 10-year rate was pinned at 4.75%, equities would not be largely impacted if NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) misses earnings on May 22nd. The interviewer then directs the conversation to discuss the volatility of the stock. The stock went down to $735 and $740 a couple of weeks ago, to which Kaiser emphasized how NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) poses a macro risk to the market, keeping in mind that it is priced for a significant swing of 10%. Companies like Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) went down double digitals, and big tech stocks, now stabilized, also have been down in correlation. To put NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) position into perspective, the company's earnings report and the way big and small tech companies react to it are extremely crucial to the AI space at the moment. The interviewer then questions how megacap tech stocks upheld their leadership position in the market. The interviewer highlights that the NASDAQ 100 hit a high in July last year and mid-January this year, and has been sideways since, relative to the S&P 500 index. Kaiser highlights the magnificent seven including, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA),  held 70% of the market cap last year, however, now they position in the 40% to 50% range, with names like Meta and Tesla not performing as well. He also suggested that the best-case scenario would be NVIDIA missing due to high demand and low supply, indicating that the market is still in high demand. He closed the interview by highlighting that if the industry is to keep progressing, NVIDIA is to keep working harder. You can also take a look at the best AI stocks that will skyrocket.

Employees are secretly bringing their own AI tools to work so they can keep up,10/5/2024 11:09,Sheryl Estrada10 May 2024 at 4:09 am·3-min read,"Good morning. For some time, I’ve been speaking with industry experts and CFOs about ways to implement AI in finance and how to determine a business case for generative AI. But there’s new eye-opening information for companies that haven’t yet come up with an AI plan. Microsoft's 2024 Work Trend Index, released on Wednesday in partnership with LinkedIn, finds that, in the last six months, the use of generative AI has nearly doubled, with 75% of global knowledge workers using it. (Knowledge workers are considered professionals in roles like public accountants, engineers, editors, and lawyers.) In addition, 78% of AI users are actually bringing their own AI tools to the workplace, which is coined “BYOAI.” And this action is without guidance or clearance from leadership. But, employees who are trying to keep up with a fast pace and large volumes of work are leaning on the technology. Microsoft and LinkedIn pointed out that BYOAI isn’t just implemented by Gen Z (85%). It cuts across all generations—millennials (78%), Gen X (76%), and boomers (73%). Seventy-nine percent of leaders surveyed agree their company needs to adopt AI to stay competitive. However, 59% worry about quantifying the productivity gains of AI. “While leaders agree AI is a business imperative, many believe their organization lacks a plan and vision to go from individual impact to applying AI to drive the bottom line,” according to the report. “The pressure to show immediate ROI is making leaders inert, even in the face of AI inevitability.” The findings are based on a survey of 31,000 people across 31 countries, identifying labor and hiring trends from LinkedIn, and analyzing Microsoft 365 productivity signals as well as research with Fortune 500 customers. You can read the full report here. Although many knowledge workers are eager to get the ball rolling with AI, some employees are hesitant to use the technology. I recently read an article in Harvard Business Review that speaks to this. It’s titled, “For Success with AI, Bring Everyone On Board” by David De Cremer, a professor of management and technology at Northeastern University. Cremer argues that it’s counterproductive for leaders to avoid involving rank-and-file employees in AI projects. Cremer writes: “If you want to avoid resistance from your employees when introducing AI, you must push them out of their comfort zone while ensuring that they understand why you’re doing so. They should know how you plan to take care of them during this transition. You’ll need to exercise patience because it will take time and effort for workers to become familiar with AI and see how it can help them in their jobs.” He provides suggestions on what organizations must do to develop employee-inclusive AI practices. Moving beyond experimentation with AI to business transformation is tough. But it seems to be a necessity to stay competitive. Have a good weekend.

The bill, sponsored by House Republicans Michael McCaul and John Molenaar and Democrats Raja Krishnamoorthi and Susan Wild, would also give the Commerce Department express authority to bar Americans from working with foreigners to develop AI systems that pose risks to U.S. national security.

Google Stares Down Largest Tech Antitrust Ruling In 2 Decades — Is AT&T-Style Breakup Next?,9/5/2024 20:21,Natan Ponieman9 May 2024 at 1:21 pm·5-min read,"Closing arguments for the largest antitrust trial to date against Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), also known as Google, wrapped up last week. Now, it's up to Judge Amit Mehta to decide on a ruling that could change the fate of the company and others in the big tech space. Mehta, of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, is expected to come up with a decision before the end of the year. The case was put forth by the Justice Department in 2020, together with attorneys general from 11 states, who are arguing that Google has engaged in anti-competitive practices in order to maintain its dominance in the internet search space. Specifically, they're looking at the billions of dollars Google pays monthly to other tech companies in order to secure its place as the default search engine in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung, LG, Motorola owned by Lenovo Group Ltd (OTC:LNVGY) and other devices as well as in browsers like Mozilla Firefox and Opera. The plaintiffs argue that this practice prevents other companies from succeeding with their own search engine products, giving Google disproportionate market share in the search engine space. Last week, court documents revealed that Google paid Apple $20 billion in 2022 to be the default search engine on Safari, the web browser used on iPhone, iPad and Mac devices. In 2021, the figure amounted to $26.3 billion when including other browsers like Firefox. Google is estimated to account for about 90% of all internet searches, widely outpacing competitors like Microsoft Corp's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Bing, Yahoo Search or DuckDuckGo, a search engine that is privately owned and focused on user privacy. The final arguments from Google's attorneys as well as DOJ lawyer David Dahlquist followed a 10-week trial between September and November 2023. Read also: Google Fights Fortnite Maker’s Play Store Changes Amid Antitrust Battle: What’s at Stake? The case, however, was three years in the making for the Justice Department.

According to sources familiar with the plans, this week, Xbox offered voluntary severance agreements to producers, quality assurance testers, and other staff at ZeniMax, which Microsoft acquired in 2020 for $7.5 billion. Additional cuts are likely across the Xbox organization, Bloomberg reports. Employees were surprised by Tuesday’s abrupt closure of three Xbox subsidiaries and the absorption of a fourth. Among those closed was Tokyo-based Tango Gameworks, known for the acclaimed action game Hi-Fi Rush, which was pitching a sequel. Xbox president Matt Booty praised Hi-Fi Rush during a town hall meeting on Wednesday. Booty mentioned that the company’s studios had been stretched too thin and that the closures aimed to reallocate resources. Booty clarified that Arkane Austin, the developer behind Prey’s shutdown, was unrelated to the poor performance of its recent multiplayer game, Redfall. Before closing, Arkane had planned to pitch a new single-player game in the Dishonored series, Bloomberg writes. Jill Braff, head of ZeniMax studios, expressed hope that the reorganization would enable a greater focus on fewer projects, given the challenge of supporting nine studios worldwide with a lean central team. Microsoft’s gaming division has grown significantly through acquisitions, including ZeniMax and Activision Blizzard, which have been worth over $76 billion combined.

OpenAI considers allowing users to create AI-generated pornography,9/5/2024 13:44,Dan Milmo Global technology editor9 May 2024 at 6:44 am·4-min read,"OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is exploring whether users should be allowed to create artificial intelligence-generated pornography and other explicit content with its products. While the company stressed its ban on deepfakes would continue to apply to the adult material, campaigners suggested the proposal undermined its mission statement to produce “safe and beneficial” AI. OpenAI, which is also the developer of the DALL-E image generator, revealed it was considering letting developers and users “responsibly” create what it termed not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content through its products. OpenAI said this could include “erotica, extreme gore, slurs, and unsolicited profanity”. It said: “We’re exploring whether we can responsibly provide the ability to generate NSFW content in age-appropriate contexts … We look forward to better understanding user and societal expectations of model behaviour in this area.” The proposal was published as part of an OpenAI document discussing how it develops its AI tools. Joanne Jang, an employee at the San Francisco-based company who worked on the document, told the US news organisation NPR that OpenAI wanted to start a discussion about whether the generation of erotic text and nude images should always be banned from its products. However, she stressed that deepfakes would not be allowed. “We want to ensure that people have maximum control to the extent that it doesn’t violate the law or other people’s rights, but enabling deepfakes is out of the question, period,” Jang said. “This doesn’t mean that we are trying now to create AI porn.” However, she conceded that whether the output was considered pornography “depends on your definition”, adding: “These are the exact conversations we want to have.” Jang said there were “creative cases in which content involving sexuality or nudity is important to our users”, but this would be explored in an “age-appropriate context”.

We have also discussed the state of salaries in the US. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 10 States where Everyday Americans Earn the Lowest Incomes. As of 2024, salaries for new roles in the US have not only been stagnant but, in some cases, have been even decreasing. Reports indicate that 48% of surveyed US companies have lowered pay for certain positions. It is concerning to note that the job market in the US has been fluctuating since the onset of the pandemic. Employers initially offered high salaries to attract talent as there was an increase in open roles. However, as economic uncertainties persisted and companies scaled back hiring efforts, the demand for workers diminished. Sectors that once experienced high demand for workers, such as hospitality, retail, and technology, are now witnessing a reset in compensation expectations due to an oversupply of labor. To read more about industries and quit rates, see the Industries with the Highest Number of Quits in the US. While salaries have been disappointing overall in the US, average salaries by profession can also vary in different states. Massachusetts has surprisingly become the state with the highest median annual salary of about $60,690, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics salary data. The number has surpassed the expectations that one might have for New York City or Silicon Valley. However, these high wages often come hand in hand with a higher cost of living, with Hawaii being the only state, apart from the District of Columbia, where living costs are higher than those of Massachusetts. In fact, Hawaii is also considered one of the states that make the most money for the US. On the other hand, Mississippi is one of the states with the lowest average salaries in the US. to read more about average salaries by state, see Average Salary in Each State in US. There is no question about why salaries are one of the biggest sources for motivation for employees at work as salaries are crucial for maintaining a decent quality of life, especially considering the varying costs of living across different cities in the US. In major US cities like New York, San Jose, and Boston, the cost of living is significantly higher which makes it crucial to earn enough to cover basic expenses comfortably. For instance, in New York City, a single individual needs approximately $138,570 annually to live comfortably, while a family with two adults and two children requires around $318,406. Similarly, San Jose requires $136,739 for an individual and $334,547 for a family in similar circumstances. Despite these concerning numbers that make high salaries look like the ultimate determinant for an average American employee, in a recent survey, 77% of respondents across 16 countries, including the United States, confirmed their personal preference for the importance of a balanced life over career growth. This trend is particularly pronounced among younger generations as 60% of millennials and 56% of Gen Z adults are willing to trade a 20% pay cut for a better work-life balance. Conversely, older demographics show less inclination, with only 45% of Gen Xers and 33% of Baby Boomers willing to make such a sacrifice. Nevertheless, Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) has recently announced a major boost in annual salaries for its US store managers, effective February 1st. The decision sees the average salary and bonus for these managers rise to $128,000 annually, up from $117,000 previously. Additionally, the revamped bonus structure will offer the potential for bonuses of up to 200% of base salary, contingent on store performance and achieved targets. Moreover, Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) also did not let its frontline hourly associates down as they raised their average hourly pay to over $18, up from $17.50 announced in the prior year. This increment goes hand in hand with Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT)’s ongoing efforts to retain employees and enhance its competitive edge in the tight labor market. With approximately 1.6 million associates in the United States, Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT)’s investment in its workforce confirm that they have a proactive approach to sustaining growth and ensuring employee satisfaction. On the other hand, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s CEO Satya Nadella has announced plans to resume performance-based raises for certain employees after a year of stagnant salaries. This decision is following internal discontentment over compensation and aims to address employee concerns. Despite Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s $3 trillion valuation, employee satisfaction has been an ongoing issue that has prompted actions like the 2022 across-the-board compensation raise and, more recently, an increase in stock awards to retain talent. Moreover, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s recent $3.3 billion investment in Wisconsin will involve the expansion of cloud computing and AI infrastructure and is expected to create approximately 2,300 union construction jobs by 2025. Moreover, the establishment of a Data Center Academy in collaboration with Gateway Technical College will train over 1,000 students to meet the demands of the burgeoning IT sector which will further enhance job prospects in the area. 25 Poorest States in the US in 2024",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/25-states-where-everyday-americans-131146174.html,MSFT
EXPLAINER-How dependent is China on US artificial intelligence technology?,9/5/2024 10:25,Josh Ye9 May 2024 at 3:25 am·4-min read,"By Josh Ye HONG KONG, May 9 (Reuters) - The Biden administration plans to put guardrails on U.S.-developed artificial intelligence (AI) models that power popular chatbots like ChatGPT to safeguard the technology from countries such as China and Russia, Reuters has reported. But China in the past year has built its own domestic generative AI industry and has been urging its companies to avoid foreign technology. Here is how reliant China currently is on U.S. AI models and the impact Washington's plans may have: HOW ACCESSIBLE ARE OPENAI’S AI MODELS IN CHINA? OpenAI’s key AI services such as ChatGPT and the DALL-E image generator have not been officially rolled out in mainland China. An OpenAI spokesperson told Reuters last year that it was unable to do so in certain countries due to local ""conditions"". However, a large number of companies and engineers have accessed OpenAI’s services using proxy tools like virtual private networks (VPN) to mask their network addresses. As such, many Chinese companies have been able to build software and applications on top of OpenAI’s models. Chinese companies also frequently benchmark their own AI models against those of OpenAI. OpenAI has shut down Chinese companies’ access to its service. Last December, OpenAI suspended the account of ByteDance, TikTok’s Chinese owner, after technology website The Verge reported that ByteDance used OpenAI’s technology to develop its own AI. In Hong Kong, China’s special administrative region, access to OpenAI’s AI models is also restricted but it is not airtight. Although OpenAI’s services are unavailable there, Microsoft , an investor and a partner of OpenAI, has released Copilot, a generative AI service built with OpenAI’s latest technology, to the public. By partnering with Microsoft, companies there can also gain access to OpenAI’s AI models.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/explainer-dependent-china-us-artificial-102511134.html,MSFT
Apple’s iPad event was an AI teaser for its future,9/5/2024 9:22,Daniel Howley·Technology Editor9 May 2024 at 2:22 am·3-min read,"Apple’s (AAPL) artificial intelligence push has begun. On Tuesday, the company unveiled its latest iPad Pros, which pack an all-new M4 processor. The chip provides the Pro with a number of benefits including a faster CPU and updated graphics processing unit. But it was Apple’s focus on the M4’s AI capabilities that stood out the most. Apple has been putting its neural engine into processors since 2017 and has previously talked up how it helps power a number of iPhone, iPad, and Mac features for some time. But the M4 unveiling was different, serving as an appetizer for the AI features the company will present at its WWDC event in June, when Apple is widely expected to debut a slew of generative AI-powered software features for its various devices. Apple pointed to a number of the M4’s AI bona fides during the keynote, with vice president of platform architecture Tim Millet specifically noting that the chip is capable of 34 trillion operations per second, a measurement commonly used when describing a chip’s AI performance. Millet also said that the M4’s neural engine is more powerful than any neural processing unit in any AI PC. That’s a direct shot at Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), and Qualcomm (QCOM), which are preparing to or are already rolling out their own AI PC chips designed to run large language models on Windows laptops and desktops. Outside of the M4’s AI processing fundamentals, Apple was mum on any substantive discussion of AI software updates. Sure, Millet said that the M4 helps the iPad Pro quickly isolate a subject from its background in a 4K video, but the M2-equipped iPad Air can do the same thing, just a bit slower. All the company had to offer was that the M4 would make AI apps and features run faster and more smoothly. The company also didn’t provide information about the M4’s performance while training or running large language models (LLMs), something that Intel, Qualcomm, and AMD regularly point to as indicators of their chips’ strengths. Still, the fact that Apple gave consumers, and Wall Street, an early look at its AI thinking is important. The company is widely viewed as behind the curve when it comes to the generative AI race, and investors are banking heavily on WWDC serving as Apple’s big AI coming-out party. CEO Tim Cook has been steadily mentioning AI more over the past few months and said during the company’s most recent earnings call that the iPhone maker is investing heavily in the technology.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/apples-ipad-event-was-an-ai-teaser-for-its-future-184058075.html,MSFT

Microsoft to shut Africa development centre in Nigeria,8/5/2024 19:25,Reuters8 May 2024 at 12:25 pm·1-min read,"LAGOS (Reuters) - Microsoft is closing down its Africa Development Centre in the continent's most populous nation Nigeria, which will lead to job losses, a spokesperson said on Wednesday.

Biden makes a Wisconsin stop to tout AI — and troll Trump's Foxconn flop,8/5/2024 18:07,Ben Werschkul·Washington Correspondent8 May 2024 at 11:07 am·4-min read,"President Biden made a trip to the swing state of Wisconsin on Wednesday with two goals. First, he was there to formally unveil a new $3.3 billion investment by Microsoft in artificial intelligence in the state. But a second clear priority was to highlight the failure of one of Donald Trump’s biggest jobs promises from his time in office. Microsoft’s (MSFT) forthcoming AI data center — as Biden was more than happy to point out repeatedly — is being built on land that was cleared during the Trump administration for a planned $10 billion Foxconn investment. The land was then abandoned when the Foxconn project was scaled way back. Trump talked a lot about infrastructure and jobs but ""didn’t build a damn thing,"" Biden said as he took the stage Wednesday afternoon, adding: ""Foxconn turned out to be just that, a con."" ""On my watch, we make promises and we keep promises,"" he added later, just in case anyone missed the message. Biden spoke at Gateway Technical College in Sturtevant, Wisc., in the afternoon before heading to campaign events elsewhere in Wisconsin and Chicago. Wednesday’s speech also offered some insights into Biden’s potential approach to the key issue of AI in the years ahead. ""We are going to build something special,"" Microsoft president Brad Smith said before Biden took the stage. He added what was perhaps a dig at Foxconn, saying, ""One thing that I’ve always felt is so important about the work we are doing here is to underpromise, overdeliver, and work with the community.""

President Joe Biden will appear at the site in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin, on Wednesday to highlight the administration’s efforts to invest in job growth in America. The news comes six years after the Trump administration announced a $10 billion investment by tech manufacturer Foxconn – with the promise to bring 13,000 jobs to the area – on the same Wisconsin land, a plan that never materialized. The new center aims to create 2,300 union construction jobs and 2,000 permanent jobs over time, according to Microsoft. Microsoft said it will use the center to train about 100,000 workers across the state on generative AI by 2030, thanks in part to a partnership with United Way Wisconsin, United Way Racine and other community partners. It also plans to open a lab on the campus of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee to help companies and manufacturers infuse the technology into their businesses. Microsoft Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella earned a master’s degree in computer science at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, according to his company profile. In his remarks Wednesday, Biden plans to directly point his finger at Trump for the failed project, according to a White House official.

12 Best Gig Economy Stocks To Buy,8/5/2024 17:07,Affan Mir8 May 2024 at 10:07 am·16-min read,"In this article, we discuss the 12 best gig economy stocks to buy. To skip the detailed analysis of the gig economy market, go directly to the 5 Best Gig Economy Stocks To Buy. The gig economy refers to a labor market characterized by short-term, freelance, or independent contractor positions, where individuals are hired on a temporary or flexible basis to complete specific tasks or projects. Gig workers are independent contractors who typically find work through online platforms or apps that connect them with clients or customers who are looking for various kinds of services such as coding, writing, and graphic designing, among others. The COVID-19 pandemic was one of the main growth catalysts for gig workers and the number of these independent contractors is rising rapidly. According to a report by MBO Partners, 45% of the US American workforce worked as independent contractors in 2023. Between 2020 and 2023, the number of independent workers grew by 89%. The report states that 40% of the gig workers said that they used online platforms to find work over the last 12 months and 47% are planning to use them over the next 12 months. According to Business Research Insights, the global gig economy market was valued at $14.75 billion in 2021. It is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20% between 2023 and 2031, reaching $92.9 billion at the end of the forecasted period. A report by the gig economy company, Upwork Inc. (NASDAQ:UPWK), posted in October 2023, revealed that Gen Z and millennials are the top earners in the gig economy with 45% of the former and 44% of the latter group making at least $2,500 a month from the platform. Moreover, as of 2022, North American and Western European citizens have the highest average freelance rates at $44 and $31 per hour, respectively. It is followed by South America at $24 per hour and Central America, Asia, Africa, and Central and Eastern Europe are all tied at $22 per hour. On February 16, MoffettNathanson’s senior research analyst, Michael Morton told CNBC that the last 12 months have been quite positive for the gig economy stocks. He said that initially, the industry was considered a weak domain by investors because it consumed $125 billion of investor capital between 2015 and 2022 while being focused on expanding market share rather than increasing profitability. However, over the last year, companies like Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) and DoorDash, Inc. (NASDAQ:DASH) have experienced a “profitability explosion” due to their corporate decisions. Morton added that according to his firm, the total addressable market for the gig economy industry is around $4 trillion. He noted that grocery delivery is a trillion-dollar market that is “underpenetrated”, and there is a chance that Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) and DoorDash, Inc. (NASDAQ:DASH) could also capture a noteworthy share of this market very soon. Micheal Morton mentioned that he has heard people refer to Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) and DoorDash, Inc. (NASDAQ:DASH) as “undeletable apps” and noted several growth prospects for these companies. They are some of the biggest gig economy companies in the world. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) posted its FY23 earnings on February 7, reporting that its gross bookings were up 19% year-over-over, and it generated a revenue of $37.28 billion, up 17% year-over-year. The company reported a net income of $1.887 billion, compared to a net loss of $9.14 billion in FY22. While Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) seems to have a promising future, it faced several headwinds in the first quarter of 2024 due to which its earnings and revenues declined slightly. It reported its Q1 earnings on May 8 with a loss per share of $0.32. Nevertheless, the company’s revenue was up 15%  year-over-year at $10.1 billion, and income from operations was $172 million, up $434 million from Q1 2023. The company reached an adjusted EBITDA of $1.4 billion, up 82% year-over-year, marking a new quarterly record for Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER). The company also generated a free cash flow of $4.2 billion over the trailing twelve months. The company’s CFO, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah, made the following remarks: “Q1 marked another strong quarter for Uber. Gross Bookings growth remained consistent at 21% YoY on a constant-currency basis (22% excluding Freight), as we generated Gross Bookings of $37.7 billion. We landed just shy of our guidance midpoint, with softer Mobility activity in LatAm as we lapped heightened demand during Carnival last year, coupled with the impact of holidays shifting into Q1 of this year. Foreign exchange was a headwind of roughly $205 million YoY or roughly 70 bps. We grew our revenue by 15% YoY on a constant-currency basis to $10.1 billion, which includes a 8 percentage point YoY headwind related to business model changes. As a reminder, certain business model changes, which have no impact on profitability, negatively impacted revenue reporting by $742 million. We expect to lap the majority of these business model changes in the second half of this year. We converted this strong top-line growth into solid profitability, with all-time high Adjusted EBITDA of $1.4 billion, up 82% YoY, and a record Adjusted EBITDA margin of 3.7% of Gross Bookings, an increase of 130 bps YoY. We intentionally held back some of our in-market Mobility investments with lower ROI as Q1 is typically a lighter quarter due to seasonal Mobility rider behaviors. We remain focused on striking the right balance between growth and profitability, and running Uber to deliver on the 3-year financial framework we set in February.” On February 15, DoorDash, Inc. (NASDAQ:DASH) reported a net loss attributed to the company and shareholders of $558 million for FY23, compared to a net loss of $1.365 billion in FY22. The company generated a revenue of $8.6 billion in 2023, compared to $6.58 billion in 2022. It announced its first quarter 2024 earnings on May 1, reporting an EPS of -$0.06. The company’s GAAP net loss including redeemable non-controlling interests was $25 million, down from $162 million in Q1 2023. The revenue for the quarter was $2.51 billion, up 23% year-over-year, which outperformed the analyst estimates by $60 million.

Surveying 31,000 individuals across 31 nations, the tech titans reveal a shift in employer preferences: ""Managers say AI aptitude could rival experience."" Significantly, 71% of leaders preferred hiring candidates with AI skills over those with more conventional experience. Compounding the issue, employers show little inclination to train existing staff in AI. Despite 66% of leaders insisting on AI skills for new hires, a mere 25% of firms plan to provide training in generative AI this year. This trend implies a burgeoning advantage for younger applicants, as employers must cast a wider net for talent beyond their organizations. Furthermore, Gen Zers with AI acumen not only stand to secure prime positions but also accelerate their ascent up the corporate ladder. The report reveals that 77% of leaders intend to delegate increased responsibilities to early-career hires with AI proficiencies. Karin Kimbrough, LinkedIn’s chief economist, tells Fortune that employees—not their bosses—are driving the push to integrate AI into their jobs.  That includes entry-level employees, like Gen Zers, who are still gaining their career footing. “AI is at work; employees are not waiting for their employers to set up official business processes to use it,” she said. “They’re already experimenting, learning, and trying it out, because they see the value proposition.” In the report, Microsoft and LinkedIn call those particularly AI-inclined workers “power users,” because they’re the most adept at finding ways to use AI to save time and improve their own performance—and while younger workers historically skew more pro-tech, the report finds that power user employees aren’t limited to one generation.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/gen-zers-could-swipe-millennials-120000162.html,MSFT
Workers are eyeing the exit in 2024 as LinkedIn and Microsoft study warns more people want to quit their jobs now than during the Great Resignation,8/5/2024 12:00,Orianna Rosa Royle8 May 2024 at 5:00 am·3-min read,"The cost of living has spiraled, the threat of layoffs (thanks to AI and overhiring) looms, and flexible working arrangements won before bosses started issuing return-to-office mandates are now like gold dust. That's why, after three years of workers quitting their jobs at a record pace—about 47 million Americans left their jobs in 2021 alone—experts have reassured employers that 2024 will be the year of the “Great Stay”. Even the professor who coined the term “Great Resignation” predicted that it would fizzle out by New Year's Eve 2023. However, new data from LinkedIn and Microsoft shows that they might have been overly optimistic. The two tech giants surveyed 31,000 individuals across 31 countries and found that the percentage of people (46%) who want to quit their jobs in the year ahead is actually higher than in 2021 (40%). Adding to the alarm, American employers are in for a rough ride: Around 85% of professionals in the U.S. are eyeing up a new job this year. Meanwhile, LinkedIn has already witnessed a 14% surge in job applications per role since the fall. Although previous reports have suggested that bosses are back in charge—and using their renewed power to claw back employee-first initiatives like working from home—LinkedIn and Microsoft’s report reveals that they shouldn't get too cozy just yet. And they know it. Nine out of 10 organizations globally are concerned about employee retention, and half of the hiring managers in Europe predict an increase in employee turnover in 2024. This means that keeping workers happy might just climb back to the top of managers' to-do lists. LinkedIn and Microsoft told Fortune that three reasons behind the sudden uptick in workers eyeing up the exit were burnout, a lack of learning opportunities, and artificial intelligence. LinkedIn’s Workforce Confidence Index found that 59% of U.S. employees who are actively job-seeking agree that they feel stuck in their job (vs. 35% of those who are not job-seeking) and 51% feel burnt out from their job (vs 37%). Likewise, Microsoft’s Work Trend Index echoed that 68% of people globally struggle with the pace and volume of work and 46% feel burned out.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/workers-eyeing-exit-2024-linkedin-120000835.html,MSFT
Biden lauds new Microsoft center on the same site where Trump's Foxconn project failed,8/5/2024 22:36,COLLEEN LONG and SEUNG MIN KIMUpdated 8 May 2024 at 3:36 pm·6-min read,"STURTEVANT, Wisc. (AP) — President Joe Biden on Wednesday laced into Donald Trump over a failed project in the previous administration that was supposed to bring thousands of new jobs into southeastern Wisconsin and trumpeted new economic investments under his watch that are coming to the same spot. That location in the battleground state will now be the site of a new data center from Microsoft, whose president credited the Biden administration's economic policies for paving the way for the new investments. For Biden, it offered another point of contrast between him and Trump, who had promised a $10 billion investment by the Taiwan-based electronics giant Foxconn that never came. “In fact, he came here with your senator, Ron Johnson, literally holding a golden shovel, promising to build the eighth wonder of the world. You kidding me?” Biden told the crowd of about 300 people, who clapped and cheered loudly as he spoke. “Look what happened. They dug a hole with those golden shovels, and then they fell into it.” Noting that 100 homes were destroyed to make way for the project, which wasted hundreds of millions of dollars, Biden added a jab: “Foxconn turned out to be just that — a con. Go figure.” Biden was in Sturtevant, in Racine County, to promote the $3.3 billion Microsoft data center, which the Democratic president said will employ about 2,300 union construction workers to build it and then 2,000 permanent employees to staff it. Microsoft’s president Brad Smith said in an interview with The Associated Press that Microsoft had a “steadfast commitment to under-promising and over-delivering” and praised the Biden administration and the state’s Democratic governor, Tony Evers, for economic policies that set the stage for the developments announced Wednesday. But Biden was eager to take the credit and use the opportunity to repeatedly take swings at Trump, arguing that his presumptive Republican challenger embraced the same type of “trickle-down economics” that Biden abhors and failed to revive domestic manufacturing during his four years in the White House. “Folks, during the previous administration, my predecessor made promises, which he broke more than kept, left a lot of people behind in communities like Racine,” Biden said. “On my watch, we make promises, and we keep promises."" Trump's campaign didn't address Foxconn, but the Republican former president often says the economy was in a much better position when he was in office and will be again should he win in 2024. Republican National Committee chairman Michael Whatley said Biden's trip was an attempt to “save face in Racine County as Wisconsinites feel the pain of Bidenomics.” “Manufacturing has stalled, family farms are shuttering, and costs are up for everything from electricity and gas to food and housing,” Whatley said. “It’s no wonder why Biden is losing in Wisconsin and battleground states across the country: his policies have failed and people want President Trump back in office.”",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/biden-heads-wisconsin-laud-microsoft-093913272.html,MSFT

These 3 stocks are poised to benefit from the massive energy transition,8/5/2024 8:00,Ines Ferré·Senior Business Reporter8 May 2024 at 1:00 am·3-min read,"The energy transition involves technologies ranging from renewables like solar and wind to electrical grid upgrades for increased power demand. While higher interest rates put pressure on the clean energy sector last year, surging electricity demands for everything from artificial intelligence to EV charging are expected to buoy the clean technologies industry. Incentives from the government's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) aimed at accelerating the transition to green, domestically produced technologies are also expected to lift the sector. The following are three stocks that analysts believe are well positioned to benefit from the energy transition in the US. Among renewables, First Solar has 31 Buy ratings, six Hold, and zero Sell recommendations. The Tempe, Arizona-based company is the largest supplier and domestic manufacturer of solar modules in the US, with a sales backlog extending beyond 2027. “FSLR is ahead of the curve and has established a robust domestic supply chain and manufacturing footprint, making it a large beneficiary of the IRA. As a domestic producer, FSLR is also able to limit high-cost freight and avoid tariffs and import risk,” RBC Capital’s Christopher Dendrinos recently noted. Goldman Sachs analysts are also bullish on the stock, seeing it as a beneficiary of utility scale projects' need to supply extra power for data centers and AI workloads. “Companies will likely look domestically for their panels to be able to benefit from domestic content bonus. In some cases, FSLR even partners directly with companies that own the data centers such as Microsoft (MSFT),” said Goldman Sachs analyst Carly Davenport and her team. Year to date, First Solar is up 14%. The maker of wind turbines and natural gas turbines recently spun off from GE (GE).

AI boom set to fuel data centre deals in Asia this year,8/5/2024 2:34,"Scott Murdoch, Kane Wu and Yantoultra Ngui7 May 2024 at 7:34 pm·4-min read","By Scott Murdoch, Kane Wu and Yantoultra Ngui SYDNEY/HONG KONG/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Global private equity investors and asset managers are readying for billions of dollars worth of M&A and investments linked to data centres in Asia Pacific, as the artificial intelligence (AI) boom fuels demand for digital infrastructure. The intense pace of deals in the world's most populous region comes as countries and companies respond to booming demand for AI, calling for more data capacity, industry executives said. Asia Pacific, including Japan, has led dealmaking activities in the global data centre market this year, with M&A value totalling $840.47 million, more than half of the global amount, LSEG data showed. In 2023, the region's data centre deals hit a record high of $3.45 billion, according to LSEG. That tally is set to be surpassed this year with at least a couple of large transactions in the pipeline. A number of financial sponsors, including global investment powerhouse Blackstone Inc, are looking to acquire AirTrunk, which owns 11 hyperscale data centres in Australia and the rest of the region, sources close to the transaction said. AirTrunk owners, Macquarie Group and Canada's Public Sector Pension Investment Board (PSP), are aiming to value the business at up to A$15 billion ($9.8 billion), sources said, in what could be Asia's largest data centre transaction this year.

12 Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy Now According to Wall Street Analysts,7/5/2024 23:40,Ramish Cheema7 May 2024 at 4:40 pm·10-min read,"In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 best artificial intelligence stocks to buy now according to Wall Street analysts. If you want to skip our coverage of the latest developments in the artificial intelligence scene, then you can skip ahead to 5 Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy Now According to Wall Street Analysts.  As companies are reporting their financial results for the first quarter of 2024, artificial intelligence once again appears to be one of the leitmotifs of the current earnings season. While the data for the current earnings season is unavailable, FactSet estimated that out of 179 companies that had earnings calls between December 15 and March 15, the term AI was mentioned on average 13 times. The tally of 179 marked the second highest for the term ""AI"" in the transcripts over the course of the past ten years, and was just three shy of the current record of 181 set during Q2 2023. Within that dataset, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) led the pack, as it mentioned the term AI 114 times during the company’s latest earnings call. The chip maker, known for its GPUs, has seen a significant boost in its stock price on the back of strong demand for semiconductors that power various AI applications. Its shares are up by a cool 216% since May 2023, after CEO Jensen Huang shared that he foresaw a the need for a ""trillion dollars of installed global data center infrastructure"" to transform computing from ""general purpose to accelerated."" Since then, NVIDIA's CEO, who is widely credited by the industry to have lead the development of GPU-accelerated computing applications such as medical imaging, reiterated his estimates of the AI industry. The latest on this front came in February 2024, when at the World Government Summit, Huang not only elaborated on his vision for accelerated computing but went on to stress that continued advancement of processors to fuel AI use cases will be energy efficient as well. According to him: ""So now, we're in the beginning of this new era. And what's going to happen is, there's about a trillion dollars worth of installed base of data centers around the world. And over the course four, five years, we'll have two trillion dollars worth of data centers that will be . .uh. . powering software around the world. And this architecture for accelerated computing is ideal for this next generation of software called generative AI. So that's really at the core of what is happening. While we're replacing the installed base, of, general purpose computing, remember that the performance of the architecture is going to be improving at the same time. So, you can't assume, just that you will buy more computers; you have to also assume that the computers are going to become faster. And, therefore, the total amount that you need is not going to be as much. Otherwise the mathematics that we just assumed, that computers never get any faster, you might come to the conclusion, we need fourteen different planets, and three different galaxies, and you know, four more Suns, to, to fuel all this. But obviously, computer architecture continues to advance."" All this focus on NVIDIA and AI means that its upcoming earnings release will be closely watched by investors and analysts worldwide. Another firm that once again has become the center of attention after quarter earnings is the Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp parent Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). Meta's stock had a strong run in February 2024 on the back of its fourth-quarter earnings report, which was accompanied by a surprise $0.5 quarterly dividend announcement. However, in April nearly all of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s gains were wiped out as investors looked past better-than-expected results and focused on the forward guidance that included Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s plans to spend $40 billion this year, most of which will go towards its AI initiatives. On the other hand, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) have managed to keep investor pessimism at bay, at least for now. Both companies reported their earnings a day after Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). Investors were pleased to see both Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) report robust growth in the Core segments, where artificial intelligence served as a major catalyst. Microsoft and Google's parent reported revenue and earnings above expectations and expressed optimism regarding maintaining the same momentum going forward. For Microsoft and Alphabet, the earnings from their cloud business divisions provide a glimpse into the firms' AI performance in the first quarter. Microsoft's overall results saw it beat analyst revenue and EPS estimates of $60.8 billion and $2.82, respectively, by posting revenue of $61.9 billion and earnings of $2.94 per share. Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment's sales sat at $26.7 billion, while Azure, the cloud computing platform, grew by 31%. At the earnings call, CFO Amy Wood also briefly commented on AI revenue growth by sharing that ""AI services contributed 7 points of growth as expected."" Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s first quarter earnings also highlighted AI due to strong performance by the Google Cloud segment. The company's Cloud business, which offers AI product bundles like Google One, posted $9.57 billion in revenue and marked a 28% growth on the year. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai shared details for Google Cloud's AI Hypercomputer, as he outlined that ""60% of funded Gen AI startups and nearly 90% of Gen AI unicorns are Google Cloud customers."" The executive added that business and corporate interest in AI was proceeding smoothly, with firms such as Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS) ""deploying Gen AI-driven tools to its nearly 10,000 call center agents to achieve faster resolution times for customers.""",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/12-best-artificial-intelligence-stocks-234048862.html,MSFT
US State Dept broadens security vendor list amid Microsoft hacking woes,7/5/2024 19:32,Zeba Siddiqui7 May 2024 at 12:32 pm·2-min read,"By Zeba Siddiqui SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of State has been working with a range of security vendors beyond Microsoft since China-linked hackers stole tens of thousands of the department's emails by breaching the tech giant's network last year, a senior official said. That hack, which compromised some 60,000 State Department emails, including those of Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, was one of the worst in recent years against a federal agency and triggered much criticism of Microsoft. The Cyber Safety Review Board slammed the company last month for its lack of transparency. ""It's not even that the software they gave me wasn't secure. It's that the keys to the kingdom were in the corporate network and their corporate network wasn't secure,"" Kelly Fletcher, the department's chief information officer said on the sidelines of the RSA Conference in San Francisco on Monday. ""We're seeing this sort of across the ecosystem ... that these corporate networks are really important,"" she said in an interview. ""I'm counting on all my vendors, not just Microsoft, not only to sell me software that's secure, but to have a secure corporate network."" A hacking group Microsoft calls Storm-558 had gained access to a digital key that allowed it to break into several government inboxes, the tech firm earlier said. The incident strained an already tense U.S.-China relationship as the Chinese embassy in Washington dismissed allegations that Chinese government-linked hackers were behind it. ""Microsoft is an important part of (the State Department's)ecosystem, absolutely. But they're not my only cloud vendor,"" Fletcher said, adding that the department would continue using multiple vendors. Some of them are Palo Alto, Zscaler, and Cisco, she added. Microsoft eventually revoked the hackers' access by invalidating the stolen digital key, but Fletcher said the breach could have had a much wider impact. ""At the time I did not imagine that it was actually that they could access anything they wanted in the Microsoft Office 365 environment for almost any organisation in the world, but that was in fact the case,"" she said, referring to the company's proprietary software.

Are Microsoft and OpenAI becoming full-on frenemies?,7/5/2024 17:39,Sharon Goldman7 May 2024 at 10:39 am·4-min read,"Hello and welcome to Eye on AI! Microsoft and OpenAI have long had a complex, codependent relationship that always makes me want to sing Avril Lavigne (“Why’d ya have to go and make things so complicated?”). It all began with Microsoft’s $1 billion investment in OpenAI in 2019 and ramped up with its $10 billion commitment in 2023, much of which is in the form of cloud compute purchases instead of cash. In exchange, Microsoft got the right to reuse OpenAI’s models and became a minority holder specifically in the profit-making part of OpenAI’s business which, in turn, is “legally bound to pursue the Nonprofit’s mission.” That arrangement gives OpenAI some unusual powers. According to OpenAI, its nonprofit board will determine when the company has “attained AGI,” or artificial general intelligence—the point at which AI finally outperforms humans at ""economically valuable work."" Once the board decides AGI has been reached, such a system will be “excluded from IP licenses and other commercial terms with Microsoft."" Translation: Once OpenAI achieves its stated mission of reaching AGI, Microsoft will presumably not have access to or be able to profit from OpenAI's AGI-level technology. Issues around OpenAI’s nonprofit board came to a head when it suddenly fired CEO Sam Altman—and then quickly reinstated him—in November 2023. Before his ouster, Altman said he and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella were “nowhere near the frenemy territory,” saying the relationship was “really good.” But recent developments leave me wondering whether the Big Tech behemoth and the $80 billion startup are becoming full-on frenemies. After all, Nadella was blindsided by Altman’s ouster, learning of it just minutes before the rest of the world. And on a joint episode of the Pivot and On with Kara Swisher podcasts during the Altman drama, he said, “One thing, I’ll be very, very clear, is we’re never going to get back into a situation where we get surprised like this, ever again.… That’s done.” These days, Microsoft is clearly hedging its bets: Less than two months ago, Microsoft announced it was forming a new organization, called Microsoft AI, with Mustafa Suleyman, founder of DeepMind and cofounder of Inflection AI, as its CEO. Microsoft also paid $650 million for the rights to Inflection’s intellectual property. And yesterday, The Information reported that Microsoft is readying a new, massive, state-of-the-art AI model to compete with OpenAI (as well as Google and Anthropic). The new model, internally referred to as MAI-1, is being overseen by Suleyman. Meanwhile, OpenAI’s Altman appears less focused on the part of the business that benefits Microsoft, and more on the company’s relentless pursuit to reach AGI. Addressing students at Stanford University last week, he honed in on his belief that any cost in support of that mission is justified. “There is probably some more business-minded person than me at OpenAI somewhere worried about how much we’re spending, but I kinda don’t,” he said. “Whether we burn $500 million a year or $5 billion—or $50 billion a year—I don’t care, I genuinely don’t,” he continued. “As long as we can figure out a way to pay the bills, we’re making AGI. It’s going to be expensive.” Whether Microsoft will keep investing in OpenAI towards that mega-cost, ill-defined mission remains to be seen. After all, according to an internal email released last week as part of the ongoing U.S. Justice Department antitrust case against Google, Microsoft initially invested in OpenAI in 2019 because it was “very worried” that Google was years ahead in scaling up its AI efforts.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-openai-becoming-full-frenemies-173939431.html,MSFT
"Microsoft's Xbox shuts multiple studios, consolidates teams in cost-cutting move",7/5/2024 17:31,Reuters7 May 2024 at 10:31 am·1-min read,"(Reuters) - Microsoft's Xbox is shutting down a number of gaming studios including Arkane Austin, making it the latest publisher to shut down studios amid signs of a gaming slowdown. Studios such as ""Hi-Fi Rush"" maker Tango Gameworks, headquartered in Tokyo, and Canada-based Alpha Dog will also be closed and some employees will be laid off, Matt Booty, head of Xbox Game Studios said in a memo that was seen by Reuters on Tuesday. Xbox declined to comment when asked about the number of employees impacted by the layoffs. Growth in personal computing and console gaming is expected to remain below pre-pandemic levels as gamers record fewer hours of playtime owing to weaker release schedules, data from research firm Newzoo showed. The ""reprioritization of titles and resources"" is so that Xbox can invest deeply into its portfolio of games and new intellectual property, according to Booty. All the affected studios are units of ZeniMax Media, which was acquired by Microsoft for $7.5 billion in 2021, and Bethesda. Microsoft's Xbox content and services segment reported a 62% jump in third-quarter revenue last month, largely driven by the Activision Blizzard acquisition. ""Grand Theft Auto"" maker Take-Two Interactive said it would shut down two subsidiary studios as part of a mass layoff, Bloomberg News reported last week.

Microsoft creates top secret AI tool for US spies,7/5/2024 17:10,Chris Price7 May 2024 at 10:10 am·45-min read,"Microsoft has developed artificial intelligence that can be used by American spies, deeming it safe because it is completely divorced from the internet. It is the first time a large language model has been fully separated from the online world and worked, a senior executive at the company told Bloomberg.

It’s time for Apple to buy—not build—its way into AI,7/5/2024 15:36,Alexei Oreskovic7 May 2024 at 8:36 am·3-min read,"Raise your hand if you've heard this one before: Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans. Those 19 words—one imagines them etched in stone somewhere at Apple HQ in Cupertino, Calif.—have served as Apple's standard statement about acquisitions for years (to the point that tech reporters can recite the phrase from memory). As far as PR statements go, it's actually a pretty accurate description of Apple's approach to M&A. With the exception of 2014's still-perplexing $3 billion Beats acquisition, Apple likes to buy companies that are small and relatively low profile—typically they're the early pieces of whatever, longer-term technological puzzle Apple is quietly assembling (which could be anything from the VisionPro to its own line of in-house microprocessors). The problem for Apple is that there's only one tech puzzle to assemble that matters today: generative AI. It's a game changer, with the power to upend even the most dominant of business models. And it's too late for Apple to start putting that puzzle together on its own. Its biggest competitors, including Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Amazon, have already released AI products, while Apple is nowhere to be seen. To be a superpower in the age of AI probably requires owning a cutting-edge large language model. That's not something you can easily build from scratch—especially if you're trying to build version 1.0 and OpenAI is already about to release GPT 5.0. All of this is to say that this is not one of those ""from time to time"" moments in which Apple has the luxury to leisurely collect small AI startups here and there. If there was ever a time when Apple needed to ""think different,"" and buy its way into the market by acquiring a large company with a working product, this is it. There's plenty to choose from—Anthropic, Cohere, and Mistral, to name a few. On the video side of things, there's Runway. Just a few weeks ago, Inflection AI sold its IP to Microsoft, and much of its AI talent, including cofounder Mustafa Suleyman, joined Microsoft. How different would the landscape look right now if Apple had snagged the Inflection team? Antitrust is obviously a risk. But Apple can point to a market full of big fish like Microsoft, Google, Meta, Amazon, and Adobe. It's not as if Apple doesn't have the money. Apple ended the most recent quarter with $58 billion in net cash, and it's giving billions back to shareholders in massive buybacks and dividends. With AI about to transform the tech industry, it's stunning that one of the most innovative companies on Earth can't think of a better use for that capital.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/time-apple-buy-not-build-153639459.html,MSFT
12 Best Large-Cap Growth ETFs,7/5/2024 15:09,Hamna Asim7 May 2024 at 8:09 am·17-min read,"In this article, we discuss 12 best large-cap growth ETFs. If you want to skip our discussion on growth investing, head over to 5 Best Large-Cap Growth ETFs.  Large-cap growth funds focus on investing in big companies, those in the top 70% in terms of market value. Growth funds constitute companies expected to grow their revenue or earnings faster than their peers or the overall market. They are often seen as risky but can be good for investors who are not risk averse and prefer long-term investments. Tom Hancock, who heads focused equity at GMO, joined CNBC’s ETF Edge on November 15, 2023, and remarked that the growth trade momentum is aided by the leadership of mega-cap tech companies that are embracing artificial intelligence. Similarly, Nathan Geraci, president of The ETF Store, agreed with Hancock's observation but noted that only a couple of stocks are leading the growth outperformance. In his words, Geraci commented: “A lot of growth performance this year has been driven by the so-called Magnificent Seven, because if you look at many of the growth indices, they’re pretty top-heavy. The largest growth companies have been enough to really drive that performance differential versus value.” Currently, US small-cap stocks are experiencing their toughest period compared to larger companies in over two decades. This reflects the investor preference for mega-cap tech stocks while smaller players grapple with inflated interest rates. According to a Financial Times report, the Russell 2000 index has seen a 24% increase since the start of 2020, significantly trailing behind the S&P 500's impressive 60% surge during the same period. This deviation from historical norms, where smaller, fast-growing companies typically offer higher returns despite higher volatility, underscores the current market dynamics. Greg Tuorto, a small-cap portfolio manager at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, pointed out the lack of significant investment in the small-cap space since 2016 or 2017, highlighting the need for increased market enthusiasm, perhaps through M&A activity or a flourishing IPO market, to reignite small-cap growth. While there are indications of the equity market expanding beyond tech giants, persistent inflation and a strong job market have led traders to accept the likelihood of higher interest rates for longer than previously anticipated. In a scenario where the Federal Reserve maintains or even raises rates, smaller companies with significant short-term or floating-rate debt, like those in the Russell 2000, are likely to be most affected. Further making a positive case for large-cap ETFs compared to their small-cap counterparts, an academic research paper took a close look at 66 large-cap and 34 small-cap ETFs listed in the United States from 2012 to 2016, covering the full trading history of these funds. The author chose to focus on the US market because it is a major player globally, and he wanted a robust sample size for the analysis. The study partially confirms what's known as the ""size effect"". Essentially, small-cap ETFs showed better returns compared to large-cap ETFs when looking at both raw and adjusted numbers. However, it is not all smooth sailing for small caps – they come with higher risk, which does not quite balance out the gains. Plus, this outperformance is not consistent year after year. When adjusted for risk, small-cap ETFs actually fall behind their larger counterparts. The same trend holds true when comparing the performance rankings of large-cap and small-cap ETFs. Some of the best large-cap growth ETFs include Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETF (NYSE:SCHG), Vanguard Growth Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VUG), and Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ). These funds expose investors to growth stocks like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).

Kevin O’Leary’s Stock Portfolio: 10 Stock Picks for 2024,7/5/2024 15:02,Sheryar Siddiq7 May 2024 at 8:02 am·9-min read,"In this article, we discuss the 10 companies to consider in the portfolio of Kevin O’Leary for 2024. If you want to skip our overview of O'Leary's investment philosophy and learn about some more companies in his stock portfolio, go directly to Kevin O'Leary’s Stock Portfolio: 5 Stock Picks for 2024. Kevin O'Leary, affectionately known as Mr. Wonderful to fans and fellow venture capitalists, is renowned as one of the venture capitalists on ""Shark Tank"" and a commentator on economic news. The Irish-Canadian kickstarted his business journey by establishing the educational software company Softkey in 1986 by leveraging the proceeds from the sale of his SET share and a $10,000 investment from his mother. This venture eventually propelled him to the forefront of the business world. Softkey specialized in producing and distributing educational software in CD format, expanding its market presence through a series of mergers and acquisitions in the early 1990s. Notable acquisitions included WordStar, Spinnaker Software, and The Learning Company, the latter of which Softkey adopted as its name following the acquisition. In terms of investing in securities, O'Leary, Chairman of O’Shares Investment Advisors, advocates for including high-quality businesses with strong balance sheets and robust financial performance in investment portfolios. Additionally, he stresses the importance of diversification across various market sectors, with dividend payments from the companies under consideration deemed as perhaps the most vital factor. To that end, O’Shares Investment Advisors' ETF, ALPS O'Shares U.S. Quality Dividend ETF (BATS:OUSA), holds stocks embodying a blend of these three attributes. The ETF has delivered growth rates of 11.55% over the past year, 38.69% over the last five years, and an impressive 86.92% since its inception. Some notable names held by the ETF include the likes of Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). The venture capitalist recently outlined his investment approach on LinkedIn, stressing the significance of cash-flow-positive investments within a diversified portfolio. Here is what he said: “A couple of years back, I sold my ETF company to Alps, the biggest ETF player in the States. It’s called O’Shares, and that’s where my family’s wealth is parked. OUSA is part of the S&P 500, cherry-picking the highest quality balance sheets with positive cash flow from around 100 out of the 500 names. Then there’s OUSM, which grabs the Russell 2000 and weeds out the underperformers – those companies not making any real dough. Forget Shark Tank, forget Bitcoin. Sure, I’ve got a 5% stake in Bitcoin and another 5% in gold, but the meat of my US portfolio? It’s in OUSA or OUSM.” Speaking further on this, Kevin O’Leary, during his appearance on 'Good Morning America,' used some of his time to unveil a number of good stock picks for first-time investors, with The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) being one of his recommendations. While investors widely regard the home improvement retailer as a dependable choice, O’Leary is particularly fond of it due to its substantial size, robust balance sheet, and consistent dividends. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is also among O'Leary's top picks, and he holds a strong affinity for the company. ""I love it,"" he said, highlighting the company's diversified product portfolio ranging from COVID-19 vaccines to Tylenol. On the other hand, despite his reservations regarding Bitcoin ETFs, O'Leary acknowledges their regulatory approval as a significant milestone for the cryptocurrency industry. He believes that only a select few, particularly those backed by major industry players like Fidelity and BlackRock Inc., will thrive. O'Leary sees this as a step towards broader acceptance of digital payment systems, such as the USDC stablecoin. While exercising caution with Bitcoin ETFs, Mr. Wonderful remains optimistic about Bitcoin's future value, estimating it could reach between $150,000 and $250,000 by 2030. However, he disagrees with Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood's more ambitious prediction of Bitcoin hitting $1.5 million by 2030, unless there is an economic catastrophe, arguing that such a rapid surge in Bitcoin's value would imply a significant downturn in the US economy. The ""Shark Tank"" star also expressed concerns about the current state of the commercial real estate market, suggesting that it is on the verge of collapse. He believes that this downturn will have far-reaching consequences, particularly for investors and small business owners. O'Leary emphasized that the current situation is unprecedented, as the commercial real estate market is not anticipated to fully recover to pre-pandemic levels. Speaking to FOXBusiness, the venture capitalist made the following comments on office spaces: “Most of these buildings were built over the last 30 years and [have mortgages with] interest rates of less than 4%,” he said. “Now the Fed has raised rates to 5.5% terminal rate, which means these mortgages are going to be refinanced at 9% to 11% — so a 3x cost. So many of these buildings won’t be economically viable.” Helga Esteb/Shutterstock.com",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/kevin-o-leary-stock-portfolio-150244693.html,MSFT
12 Best Investments for Beginners in 2024,7/5/2024 15:00,Sheryar Siddiq7 May 2024 at 8:00 am·10-min read,"In this article, we will take a look at the 12 best investments for beginners in 2024. To skip our analysis of the recent market trends and market activity, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Investments for Beginners in 2024. With the first quarter of 2024 now concluded, the stock market has evolved. Continuing trends from Q4 2023, the period witnessed the sustained growth of artificial intelligence and technology stocks, with investors remaining optimistic about AI's potential across consumer and business applications, alongside expectations of multiple interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve throughout the year. However, as we move into the second quarter of the year, investor sentiment has shifted from anticipating a strong economic environment to reassessing strategies for allocating significant funds into the stock market. In April, U.S. job growth decelerated more than anticipated, with the annual wage increase dipping below 4.0% for the first time in nearly three years, according to the Labor Department's latest employment report released on April 3. The unemployment rate also rose slightly to 3.9% from March's 3.8%, attributed to a growing labor supply. Nonfarm payrolls expanded by 175,000 jobs last month, marking the lowest increase in six months, with revisions revealing 22,000 fewer jobs created in February and March than initially reported. Despite these figures, the jobless rate persisted below 4% for the 27th consecutive month. The signs of a cooling labor market sparked optimism that the U.S. central bank could orchestrate a ""soft landing"" for the economy, dispelling concerns of stagflation, which had been fueled by reports of subdued economic growth and elevated inflation in the first quarter. In that regard, Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman reiterated her readiness to raise the policy rate if progress stalls or reverses, while expressing confidence that inflation will continue to decline even as the central bank maintains its benchmark interest rate at current levels: ""My baseline outlook continues to be that inflation will decline further with the policy rate held steady, but I still see a number of upside inflation risks that affect my outlook. While the current stance of monetary policy appears to be at a restrictive level, I remain willing to raise the federal funds rate at a future meeting should the incoming data indicate that progress on inflation has stalled or reversed."" Although inflation has decreased from its peak in mid-2022, it remains significantly above the central bank's target range. Most reports this year have indicated an annual inflation rate of around 3%, with the Fed's preferred measure, the core personal consumption expenditures price (PCE) index, recently standing at 2.8%. Rising prices have led to upward pressure on wages, contributing to an inflationary environment that has prevented the Fed from taking aggressive steps to cut interest rates, despite market expectations suggesting otherwise. If you're a beginner in the world of investments and finance, diving right in can seem daunting with everything mentioned above. However, there are strategies to simplify the process and increase your chances of success. One approach is to focus on established, well-known companies with strong financial foundations. These household names often offer more stability and growth potential over time. By avoiding riskier investments and sticking to proven businesses, beginners can build a solid foundation for their investment journey and increase their likelihood of early success in the stock market. In that regard, some of the best stocks to invest in 2024 for beginners include the likes of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), among others listed below. Source:unsplash Our Methodology To compile this list, we utilized a stock screener to identify stable companies demonstrating at least low to mid-teens revenue growth. Subsequently, we sorted these companies by market capitalization to prioritize the largest ones. Our selection criteria focused on stocks suitable for beginners, considering both revenue growth and hedge fund sentiment as of the fourth quarter of 2023.

OpenAI to launch tool to detect images created by DALL-E 3,7/5/2024 13:36,Reuters7 May 2024 at 6:36 am·1-min read,"(Reuters) - OpenAI is launching a tool that can detect images created by its text-to-image generator DALL-E 3, the Microsoft-backed startup said on Tuesday amid rising worries about the influence of AI-generated content in this year's global elections. The company said the tool correctly identified images created by DALL-E 3 about 98% of the time in internal testing and can handle common modifications such as compression, cropping and saturation changes with minimal impact. The ChatGPT creator also plans to add tamper-resistant watermarking to mark digital content such as photos or audio with a signal that should be hard to remove. As part of the efforts, OpenAI has also joined an industry group that includes Google, Microsoft and Adobe and plans to provide a standard that would help trace origin of different media. In April, during the ongoing general election in India, fake videos of two Bollywood actors that are seen criticizing Prime Minister Narendra Modi have gone viral online. The spread of AI-generated content and deepfakes are being increasingly used in India and in elections elsewhere in the world including in the U.S., Pakistan and Indonesia.

"British Microsoft-backed self-driving startup Wayve raises $1 billion, clocking new high in Europe-based AI funding deal",7/5/2024 13:21,Prarthana Prakash7 May 2024 at 6:21 am·4-min read,"British self-driving startup Wayve has raised $1 billion in its latest funding round, setting a record for venture capital investment into a Europe-based AI company. Announced Tuesday, the Series C round, led by Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, also included AI giants Nvidia and Microsoft. London-based Wayve, founded in 2017, makes software for autonomous driving that enables vehicles to learn as they drive and make on-the-road decisions on their own. Wayve counts Microsoft and Meta’s chief scientist, Yann Le Cunn, among its high-profile backers. The company, founded by University of Cambridge PhD students Alex Kendall and Amar Shah, had raised $300 million in previous funding rounds. The company’s valuation following the latest venture capital investment has not been disclosed. Wayve will use the funds to expand and launch its AI software products—which it refers to as “Embodied AI” because similar systems could be used for any autonomous device that has to navigate and act in the physical world—eventually deploying those systems in vehicles built by major automotive manufacturers. The startup’s software is different from previous generations of self-driving AI because its models are trained “end-to-end”—taking in camera and sensor data about what is happening around the vehicle and outputting the best driving action to take. The company has also trained an AI system that pairs a large language model with a driving model, so that a vehicle can explain what it is seeing and why it is taking certain actions, and also take instruction in natural language. Earlier self-driving cars relied on multiple small AI models, each of which did one particular thing, such as identify objects in camera data, and then fused these small models together with complicated rules-based software to arrive at driving decisions. “This significant funding milestone highlights our team’s unwavering conviction that Embodied AI will address the long-standing challenges the industry has faced in scaling this technology to everyone, everywhere,” Wayve cofounder and CEO Kendall said in a statement Tuesday. The investment is a big win for Britain, which already has twice as many AI-focused companies as any other European country, employing over 50,000 people and contributing £3.7 billion ($4.6 billion) to the economy. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has tried to position the country as a global AI hub, at the forefront of both development and regulation. Votes of confidence from leading companies have helped affirm the U.K.’s position.

15 Best Places to Retire in Alabama,6/5/2024 19:47,Rabia Mazhar6 May 2024 at 12:47 pm·12-min read,"This article takes a look at the 15 best places to retire in Alabama. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis of the investment landscape surrounding US retirement, you may go to 5 Best Places to Retire in Alabama. Turns out college students aren’t the only ones prone to leaving things to the last minute - several adults are pretty much on the same track when it comes to saving for their retirement. In the US, there is no legal requirement under which a company has to offer a 401(k) plan to its employees in most states- although companies such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) do offer 401(k) plans with partial matching. Without this requirement, many people miss out on saving for retirement altogether. In fact, according to Ramsey Solutions, employer-sponsored retirement savings plans are withheld from about a third of US workers, whereas the latest Survey of Consumer Finances reports that a massive 46% of Americans are without a retirement account altogether. All this does not seem very promising, especially with a Northwestern Mutual study revealing that Americans themselves believe they require a whopping $1.46 million for a comfortable retirement. The question of the hour, then, is how can this disparity between what Americans need in their retirement and what they currently have be solved? Founder and CEO of hedge fund management company Pershing Square Capital Management, Bill Ackman, has a rather unique perspective. Ackman proposes that the US government give every newborn child in the country seven grand. Of course, Ackman doesn’t propose simply handing the money away. Instead, he details putting $7,000 into an account when a child is born, barring it from withdrawals, exempting it from taxation, using it in index fund investment, and letting the amount compound. “We can't wait until people start creating an IRA or a 401(k) by the time they're, you know, 25 or 30 or 35 ... Just because of the laws of compounding. That extra 25 years is very, very material.” -Bill Ackman, Founder and CEO, Pershing Square Capital Management According to numbers by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly 3.6 million children were born in the US in 2023. If Ackman’s advice is implemented, the cost comes out to about $25 billion. While this number may seem shockingly high, it’s a drop in the ocean compared to the US government’s 2024 fiscal year spending which included a national defense budget of $433 billion. As for more real avenues, there are other paths that individuals can explore for retirement savings in the case of their company not offering a 401(k) plan. Some options that Americans can look towards include traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs, and health savings accounts. Each of these has its own benefit. For instance, traditional IRAs allow you to accumulate tax-advantaged retirement dollars, Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals and growth during retirement as well as flexibility as there are no minimum distributions, and health savings accounts are also known for their tax-free growth. Of course, these are just some of the retirement savings options available to individuals, and the investment world is much more vast. So, even if you don’t enroll in plans such as those offered by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) employees, all is not lost when it comes to saving and investing for your Golden Years. There’s no age limit to it either - even if you’ve reached your 50s, there are still steps that you can take to secure your retirement. For possible ideas, you can refer to retirement savings tips for 55-to-64-year-olds. Speaking of saving and investing, the amount that you accumulate for your retirement is directly tied to the location of your retirement. Consider Alabama, for instance - $2,500 a month would fare very differently than in states such as California or New Jersey. Starting off with one of the biggest monthly expenses, the state of Alabama is extremely accommodating when it comes to rent. Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) lists the median price for a one-bedroom rental in Alabama to sit at $925 - a whole 42% lower than Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z)’s reported national median of $1,600. The state is also tax-friendly toward retirees. Not only is Alabama among the states that won’t tax Social Security income in 2024, but private and public pensions are also exempt from taxation. On the non-financial side, there are other benefits to an Alabama retirement with climate being one of them. The state enjoys a temperate humid subtropical climate, ideal for retirees who want to avoid extreme weather conditions. All in all, retiring in Alabama is a good idea.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/15-best-places-retire-alabama-194747837.html,MSFT

15 Countries with the Highest Average Salaries in Asia,6/5/2024 16:47,Afifa Mushtaque6 May 2024 at 9:47 am·9-min read,"In this article, we will look at the 15 countries with the highest average salaries in Asia. We have also discussed the economic development taking place in Asia in 2024. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Countries with the Highest Average Salaries in Asia. According to the Asian Development Bank, Developing Asia is forecasted to grow by 4.9% in 2024 and maintain the same rate in 2025, driven by factors like the end of interest rate hikes and a recovery in goods exports, especially in semiconductor demand. India is leading in the investment-driven growth, positioning itself as a major economic engine in the region. Moreover, inflation in developing Asia is projected to be 3.2% in 2024, slightly decreasing to 3.0% in 2025. Subregionally, South Asia is leading in growth, with forecasts of 6.3% in 2024 and 6.6% in 2025. India's growth is anticipated to remain strong at 7.0% in fiscal year 2024, supported by rising consumption and investment. Bangladesh expects growth driven by garment exports, while Bhutan sees growth due to hydropower investment. Pakistan and Sri Lanka are set to recover from previous contractions, though challenges like inflation persist. Southeast Asia forecasts growth of 4.6% in 2024 and 4.7% in 2025, with Indonesia, Thailand, Viet Nam, the Philippines, and Malaysia driving growth through strong domestic demand and recovering exports. Meanwhile, the Pacific expects a slight decline in 2024 before picking up in 2025, with Papua New Guinea leading growth due to increased mining activity. While the economic development looks promising, it is worth highlighting that in South Asia, job creation has struggled to keep up with the rapid expansion of the working-age population, according to a report by the World Bank. Over the period from 2000 to 2023, employment grew at a rate of 1.7% annually, while the working-age population increased by 1.9% each year. This imbalance led to a situation where the region was only able to generate an average of 10 million jobs annually, despite a working-age population growth of 19 million per year. India, the largest economy in South Asia, has experienced major challenges in job creation despite strong economic growth. The country's employment ratio declined over the same period, except for a partial rebound in 2023. While India's economy is expected to expand at a rate of 6.6% with the potential for even stronger growth, private investment remains weak. Speaking of jobs, finance specialists and information technology specialists are two of the highest paying jobs in Asia. To read more about highest payings jobs, see the Best Remote Jobs That Pay at Least $100 an Hour. Owing to the economic potential of Asia, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is currently involved in several contributions to Asia, particularly in Malaysia, with a landmark investment of $2.2 billion over the next four years. It is Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s largest commitment in its 32-year history in Malaysia and is essentially focused on several key areas such as building digital infrastructure and creating AI skilling opportunities. The investment will also entail building cloud and AI infrastructure in Malaysia, which will not only meet the growing demand for cloud computing services but also enable the country to capitalize on the economic opportunities presented by AI technology. Additionally, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) aims to provide AI skilling opportunities for an additional 200,000 people in Malaysia and hence, contribute to the development of a skilled workforce prepared for the AI era. Furthermore, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is strengthening its partnership with the Government of Malaysia to establish a national AI Centre of Excellence and enhance the country’s cybersecurity capabilities. While Asia has been a hot destination for investments by several multinational companies, it is not immune to global lay offs. For example, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) plans to slash around 50 investment banking jobs in the Asia-Pacific region, with the majority concentrated in Hong Kong and China. These cuts will affect roughly 13% of the regional banking workforce and highlight the severity of the challenges facing the industry.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/15-countries-highest-average-salaries-164711109.html,MSFT

Jim Cramer last week thanked Fed Chair Jerome Powell for giving an ""all-clear"" sign by keeping interest rates unchanged. Cramer said that the Fed's dovish comments catapulted the market from the pits of deep red to new highs. He thinks Jerome Powell has become ""the bull's friend for the moment, maybe best friend."" Jim Cramer said that despite the signs of ""softness all over the place,"" Powell is currently ""more of a dove than a hawk"" since he believes inflation will ""go away on its own."" Cramer said Jerome Powell was ""badgered"" by the media about the possibility of another rate hike. But Powell, according to Cramer, is ""too smart"" as he didn’t take the ""bait"" and took the ""dreaded"" rate hike scenario ""off the table."" "" I think Jay Powell has realized that these brown shoots are doing the work for him and his consistent messaging in the face of endless Fedspeak tells me that I think you should hand on to stocks."" Jim Cramer in another program last week again voiced his frustrations about the market's obsession with the Federal Reserve's comment, saying jobs numbers, inflation, possibility of rate cuts and the Fed's future moves is ""all we talk about."" Cramer said that some analysts were expecting the Fed chief Jerome Powell to ""lower the boom"" of the stock market by ""saying something hawkish."" Cramer is surprised that some circles in the market are talking about another raise. ""We are one again hostage to everyone's worries about the Fed which is another way of saying, everyone's worries about inflation."" After analyzing the current market situation, Cramer came straight to what matters the most for an average investor: ""So, what wins in this environment? What do you do?

"Microsoft readies new AI model to compete with Google, OpenAI, The Information reports",6/5/2024 14:47,Reuters6 May 2024 at 7:47 am·2-min read,"(Reuters) -Microsoft is training a new, in-house AI language model large enough to compete with those from Alphabet's Google and OpenAI, the Information reported on Monday. The new model, internally referred to as MAI-1, is being overseen by recently hired Mustafa Suleyman, the Google DeepMind co-founder and former CEO of AI startup Inflection, the report said, citing two Microsoft employees with knowledge of the effort. The exact purpose of the model has not been determined yet and will depend on how well it performs. Microsoft could preview the new model as soon as its Build developer conference later this month, the report said. Microsoft declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.

Here's Why We Think Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Might Deserve Your Attention Today,5/5/2024 13:01,editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St)5 May 2024 at 6:01 am·3-min read,"For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away. So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it.  View our latest analysis for Microsoft  If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Microsoft managed to grow EPS by 16% per year, over three years. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up. Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. The music to the ears of Microsoft shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 41% to 45% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book. In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image. Fortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of Microsoft's future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting. Owing to the size of Microsoft, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$1.0b. This comes in at 0.03% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors. One important encouraging feature of Microsoft is that it is growing profits. If that's not enough on its own, there is also the rather notable levels of insider ownership. These two factors are a huge highlight for the company which should be a strong contender your watchlists. Still, you should learn about the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Microsoft. There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features. You can access a tailored list of companies which have demonstrated growth backed by recent insider purchases.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-think-microsoft-nasdaq-130119438.html,MSFT
The ending of Google's monopoly trial has Silicon Valley on edge,5/5/2024 11:38,Alexis Keenan·Reporter5 May 2024 at 4:38 am·5-min read,"Google has a lot at stake as a federal judge weighs whether the tech giant’s search empire should be broken up. So does the rest of Silicon Valley. A landmark antitrust case pitting Google (GOOG, GOOGL) against the Justice Department entered its final stage this past week as prosecutors from the federal government and 14 states said in their closing arguments that Google illegally monopolized the online search and search advertising markets. Google's lawyer, John Schmidtlein, pushed back one more time with a claim the company has made from the beginning: ""Google is winning because it’s better,"" he said. A government win would certainly threaten a giant piece of Google’s $237.8 billion profit engine. But the outcome, which will be decided by US District Judge Amit Mehta in the weeks or months to come, also has giant implications for some of the other big names in the tech world. That's because Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) are defending themselves against a series of other federal- and state-led antitrust suits, some of which make similar claims, and because all three stand to lose or gain depending on the outcome. In Apple’s case, US attorneys have alleged the iPhone maker blocked rivals from entering the smartphone market by using a “web of contractual restrictions.” A similar claim was made by the government in Google's case, which hinges on several types of contracts that Google allegedly used to cement its search dominance. ""The broad lessons here are a long way off, but this is clearly a really important time when the very first of these tech cases is going to be decided,"" said University of Washington antitrust professor Douglas Ross. ""I do think they're going to be interested in how narrowly or broadly [the judge] defines the markets here,"" Ross added, ""and if there is any learning in what he writes that might have application elsewhere.""",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/the-ending-of-googles-monopoly-trial-has-silicon-valley-on-edge-113835464.html,MSFT
Warren Buffett pays tribute to Charlie Munger on a 'tough day' for shareholders,4/5/2024 16:29,Seana Smith·Host4 May 2024 at 9:29 am·4-min read,"A new vibe at the Woodstock of capitalism. Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK-A, BRK-B) annual shareholder meeting on Saturday marked a new era for the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett. It’s the investing legend’s first without his right-hand man, Charlie Munger, who passed away on Nov. 28, 2023, just shy of his 100th birthday. While Munger’s absence is significant, his presence loomed throughout the CHI Health Center in Omaha, Nebraska. Charlie Munger’s name was among the first words uttered by Buffett as he took the stage. Buffett described Munger as the “architect of Berkshire,” and his request to shareholders to “join me in applauding Charlie” was met with cheers and a standing ovation by a crowd that included the likes of Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, Citigroup (C) CEO Jane Fraser, and Microsoft (MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates. “In terms of having a partner, I simply cannot think of a conversation I had with Charlie that he misled me,” Buffett later told the packed house. Buffett added: “In terms of managing money, there wasn’t anybody better in the world to talk to for many, many decades than Charlie.” The meeting started with a video tribute to the former vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, which included a number of Munger’s famous one-liners from prior meetings, including “I think that every time you saw the word EBITDA, you should substitute the word 'bulls***' earnings.” EBITDA is more formally known on the Street as shorthand for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Companies tend to hype the metric as a purer read on the health of the business rather than net profits. “It’s a bittersweet moment, … a tough day for a lot of people,” new Brooks Running CEO Dan Sheridan told me of Munger’s absence.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-pays-tribute-to-charlie-munger-on-a-tough-day-for-shareholders-162940889.html,MSFT
23 Most Profitable Stocks of the Last 12 Months,4/5/2024 11:38,Usman Kabir4 May 2024 at 4:38 am·23-min read,"In this article, we discuss the 23 most profitable stocks of the last 12 months. If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to 5 Most Profitable Stocks of the Last 12 Months.  The United States stock market has come a long way since the turn of the millennium more than two decades ago. Emerging from the dotcom boom and bust without permanent damage, the economy has faced the financial meltdown of 2008, a tech-enabled boom that has resulted in trillion dollar valuations, and the pandemic crisis of 2020 that ground business to almost a complete halt across the globe. From 2003 to 2023, the benchmark S&P 500 has registered double digits annual returns thirteen times. Investors at the stock market have made money from this growth by piling into profitable stocks like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). However, even as these tech stocks become the hottest equities, old-school value investing has yet to lose charm. Value investors who like to invest in profitable companies with high gross margins and net income have made shrewd investments in businesses with a solid track record over these twenty years. For example instead of NVDA, we identified the cheapest AI stock that is trading at less than 5 times market value excluding cash and investments using the value investing approach. The present condition of the stock market is better understood in the context of a recent research report by investment advisory Deutsche Bank. The report underlines that the seven biggest companies in the S&P 500 now have a combined market capitalization that make these firms the second biggest stock market in the world, almost double the size of the Japanese market that is in fourth position. Jim Reid, the head of global economics and thematic research at the advisory, has warned that this makes the US market most concentrated in history.  The fortunes of these firms are set to rise even further as AI hype and rate cut expectations serve to increase interest in growth stocks. Businesses are investing heavily in AI tools to keep pace with industry demand in this regard. Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), recently highlighted the role that he expected AI to play in changing work trends in the coming years and months. He made these comments during the second quarter earnings call at the end of January.  “A growing body of evidence makes clear the role AI will play in transforming work. Our own research, as well as external studies, show as much as 70% improvement in productivity, using generative AI for specific work tasks, and overall early Copilot for Microsoft 365 users were 29% faster in the series of tasks, like searching, writing, and summarizing. Two months in, we have seen faster adoption than either our E3 or E5 suites as enterprises, like Dentsu, Honda, Pfizer, all deploy Copilot to their employees, and we are expanding availability to organizations of all sizes. We're also seeing a Copilot ecosystem begin to emerge ISVs like Atlassian, Mural, and Trello, as well as customers like Air India, Bayer, and Siemens have all built plug-ins for specific lines of business that extend Copilot's capabilities.” Our Methodology To select stocks for this list, we used the FinViz stock screener to identify companies with high gross margins and net income. The Finance Charts database was then used to identify firms with the best net income growth in the past twenty years. The analyst ratings of each stock are also discussed to provide readers with some context for their investment choices. The hedge fund sentiment around each stock was calculated using the data of around 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the fourth quarter of 2023. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator. An overhead view of a bustling stock exchange, with brokers and traders exchanging stocks.

Markets brace for Nvidia earnings: What to know this week,20/5/2024 13:00,Josh Schafer·ReporterUpdated 20 May 2024 at 6:00 am·7-min read,"Stocks have once again ended a trading week having hit new records.  Signs of an inflation cooldown prompted markets to grow more optimistic about the prospect of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts and stocks rallied as a result, with all three major averages hitting record highs on Wednesday.  For the week, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose more than 2% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) popped more than 1.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained more than 1%, closing above 40,000 for the first time ever on Friday. In the week ahead, highly anticipated earnings results from Nvidia (NVDA) are expected to be the key catalyst for markets. Results from Target (TGT), Palo Alto Networks (PANW), and Lowe's (LOW) will also be closely tracked by investors. The week is expected to be quieter on the economic front, with updates on activity in the manufacturing and services sectors as well as the final reading of consumer sentiment for May on tap. Minutes from the Fed's May meeting are also expected on Wednesday afternoon. April's reading of the Consumer Price Index showed core prices, which strip out the more volatile costs of food and gas, rose 3.6% over last year — the lowest annual rise in three years. This prompted investors to price in two full interest rate cuts this year for the first time since early April. The move brings the market closer in line with the Fed's projections of two or three interest rate cuts at some point this year. BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski listed investors' alignment with the Fed on interest rate cuts as a reason supporting his call for the S&P 500 to end 2024 at 5,600, an increase of less than 7% from Friday's close. For investors, the key question will be whether this bullish narrative is sustainable or if the market will once again jump ahead of the Fed as it did in early 2024 when investors priced in nearly seven interest rate cuts on the back of positive economic data. The first test will come on Wednesday with the release of minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's May meeting, which will provide a deeper look at the discussion among officials. ""The minutes from the May FOMC meeting should sound more hawkish on the margin than Chair Powell's press conference,"" Bank of America US economist Michael Gapen wrote in a note to clients. ""Though Powell signaled the bar for hikes is high and that standing pat is the proper response to disinflation stalling out, others on the committee were more concerned about whether policy was doing enough."" Belski's year-end target bump was followed by another forecast raise on Friday. Deutsche Bank chief equity strategist Binky Chadha boosted his year-end target for the benchmark to 5,500 from 5,100. Chadha cited robust earnings growth and an improving macroeconomic outlook as reasons stocks could keep moving higher.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/markets-brace-for-nvidia-earnings-what-to-know-this-week-130053537.html,NVDA
"Nvidia earnings could spark $200 billion swing in shares, options show",21/5/2024 5:02,Saqib Iqbal Ahmed20 May 2024 at 10:02 pm·2-min read,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed NEW YORK (Reuters) - Traders are pricing in a big move for Nvidia’s shares after the chipmaker reports earnings on Wednesday, though expectations for volatility are more muted than in the past, U.S. options markets show. Nvidia's options are primed for an 8.7% swing in either direction by Friday, according to data from options analytics firm Trade Alert. That would translate to a market cap swing of $200 billion - larger than the market capitalization for about 90% of S&P 500 companies. While massive by most measures, that implied move would fall far short of the 16.4% jump Nvidia’s shares notched after the company’s most recent quarterly earnings report. It is also less aggressive than the average 12% move traders had priced for the last eight quarters. ""Volatility and expectations had been a fair amount higher the last time around,"" said Chris Murphy, co-head of derivative strategy at Susquehanna Financial Group. Nvidia, up about 87% this year, is seen as a bellwether of the burgeoning AI industry and has a market value of about $2.3 trillion, making it the third-largest company on Wall Street, behind Microsoft and Apple. Wall Street is betting on a blowout quarterly report from Nvidia. Investor interest has spread out to other beneficiaries of the AI theme in recent months. ""AI benefits are broadening out to power, commodities and utilities,"" BofA strategists including Gonzalo Asis wrote in a note on Monday. ""It's not just about NVDA anymore."" BofA’s strategists expect the company to drive 9% of the S&P 500 earnings growth over the next 12 months, compared to 37% over the last 12 months.

By 03:30 ET (07:30 GMT), the Dow futures contract was mostly unchanged, S&P 500 futures had inched higher by 3 points or 0.1%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had edged down by 9 points or 0.1%. The Nasdaq Composite was the stand-out performer in the prior session, with the tech-heavy index closing at an all-time record high thanks to bubbling enthusiasm over the upcoming results from Nvidia. Markets are keen to see if the semiconductor group, whose chips have made it a focal point of booming interest in the possible applications of AI, will deliver yet another quarter of massive growth despite increasing competition. Commentary from several Fed policymakers, meanwhile, indicated that the central bank still wants to see more evidence that inflation is sustainably cooling to its 2% target before rolling out any possible interest rate reductions this year. But the statements did little to persuade traders to recalculate wagers that the Fed will unveil a cut as soon as September. 2. Palo Alto Networks posts disappointing billings forecast Shares in Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) slipped in extended hours trading after the group's outlook for fourth-quarter billings received a tepid response from some analysts. Like other cybersecurity firms, Palo Alto has been facing weakness in spending by clients concerned by an uncertain economic environment. Customers, wary of the possible risks posed by placing all of their digital security needs in the hands of one company after a recent spate of high-profile breaches, are also investing in multiple vendors. In a call with analysts, Chief Executive Nikesh Arora noted that Palo Alto's ongoing attempt to consolidate its users on to one centralized platform has enjoyed ""initial traction."" However, he said this strategy has driven an increase in bookings with deferred payments and impacted billings, adding that this trend is ""something we expect will continue.""",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/futures-muted-palo-alto-networks-034234649.html,NVDA

"Is Nvidia (NVDA) a Solid Growth Stock? 3 Reasons to Think ""Yes""",20/5/2024 16:45,Zacks Equity Research20 May 2024 at 9:45 am·3-min read,"Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task. By their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss. However, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks. Nvidia (NVDA) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank. Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better. While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below: Earnings Growth Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration. While the historical EPS growth rate for Nvidia is 50%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 87.1% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of -12.3%.

Intuit (INTU) to Report Q3 Earnings: What's in the Offing?,20/5/2024 16:34,Zacks Equity Research20 May 2024 at 9:34 am·4-min read,"Intuit INTU is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2024 results on May 23.For the fiscal third quarter of 2024, INTU expects revenues to grow between 10% and 11% on a year-over-year basis to the band of $6.605-$6.655 billion.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $6.63 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 10.25%.On a non-GAAP basis, Intuit anticipates earnings per share in the range of $9.31-$9.38.

The Credit Karma business contributed $375 million to Intuit’s fiscal second-quarter total revenues, which remained flat year over year due to growth in Credit Karma Money, credit cards and auto loans, offset by a decline in home loans, personal loans and auto insurance.

The world’s most valuable semiconductor company continued its hot streak of 2023, gaining more than $1.1 trillion in market cap so far this year, powered by the accelerating demand for artificial intelligence (AI).The chipmaker has risen 37.1% over the past three months, outperforming the industry’s growth of 21.5%. The strong trend is expected to reverse, given that NVIDIA has a higher chance to beat earnings estimates and saw positive earnings estimate revision activity, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat (read: What's Ahead for Nvidia ETFs?).ETFs having the largest allocation to NVIDIA could make compelling plays ahead of its earnings report. These include Strive U.S. Semiconductor ETF SHOC, VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF SMH, Grizzle Growth ETF DARP, TrueShares Technology, AI and Deep Learning ETF LRNZ and Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF SOXQ. NVIDIA currently has an Earnings ESP of +3.62% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Analysts increasing estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a good indicator for the stock. NVIDIA is expected to post massive earnings and revenue growth of 402.7% and 237.5%, respectively, for the to-be-reported quarter. NVIDIA’s earnings surprise history is good, as it delivered an earnings surprise of 20.18%, on average, in the last four quarters.NVIDIA currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.20 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 41 brokerage firms. The current ABR compares to an ABR of 1.20 a month ago based on 41 recommendations.Of the 41 recommendations deriving the current ABR, 36 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 87.8% and 4.88% of all recommendations. A month ago, Strong Buy made up 87.8%, while Buy represented 4.88%.Based on short-term price targets offered by 40 analysts, the average price target for NVIDIA comes to $990.51. The forecasts range from a low of $608.40 to a high of $1,350.00. Investors will be closely watching the updates for the company’s new chip, Blackwell, which will be the world’s most powerful chip and the highest-performance AI chip on the market ahead of its current H200 series and AMD’s (AMD) MI300 series. Blackwell-based products will be available later this year. Most analysts expect a slowdown during the transition to these next-generation models from NVIDIA’s older H100 chips.NVIDIA remained an undisputed leader in the AI space even following the recent launch of GPT-4o from ChatGPT maker OpenAI.

Nvidia (NVDA) Is Up 2.89% in One Week: What You Should Know,20/5/2024 16:00,Zacks Equity Research20 May 2024 at 9:00 am·4-min read,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades. Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us. Below, we take a look at Nvidia (NVDA), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions. It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Nvidia currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period. You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>> Set to Beat the Market? Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for NVDA that show why this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence shows promise as a solid momentum pick. A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area. For NVDA, shares are up 2.89% over the past week while the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry is up 2.75% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 21.36% compares favorably with the industry's 6.66% performance as well.

Should You Buy Snowflake (SNOW) Stock Ahead of Q1 Earnings?,20/5/2024 15:59,Aniruddha Ganguly20 May 2024 at 8:59 am·4-min read,"Snowflake SNOW is set to report its first-quarter fiscal 2025 results on May 22.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the top line is pegged at $786.95 million, suggesting year-over-year growth of 26.19%.The consensus mark for the bottom line is pegged at 17 cents per share, up by a penny over the past 30 days, indicating 13.33% year-over-year growth.The company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 129.25%.Snowflake shares have declined 29.7% since the fourth-quarter earnings release (Feb 28, 2024) against the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s return of 7.1%.   Snowflake Inc. price-eps-surprise | Snowflake Inc. Quote Nevertheless, we believe that Snowflake shares are attractive at the current level due to an innovative portfolio, a strong partner base and an expanding clientele.Snowflake currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with a Growth Score of A, a combination that offers a good investment opportunity, per the Zacks proprietary methodology. A Momentum Score of B makes SNOW further attractive to investors. You can find the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. SNOW has been suffering from challenging macroeconomic conditions, including persistent inflation, which have hurt its customer spending patterns. Although bookings grew meaningfully in the fiscal fourth quarter, reflecting an improved macroeconomic environment, the consumption trend is expected to have been sluggish.However, Snowflake has been riding on an expanding portfolio. Snowpark is expected to contribute 3% to product revenues in fiscal 2025. Product revenues are expected to be $3.25 billion, indicating 22% year-over-year growth for fiscal 2025.The growing adoption of Snowpark by data scientists and engineers is expected to have aided the company’s top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter. For first-quarter 2025, Snowflake expects revenues between $745 million and $750 million, implying year-over-year growth between 26% and 27%.Newly introduced solutions, including Cortex, a new fully-managed service making AI simple and secure, Streamlit in Snowflake, Snowpark ML Modeling API, and Cortex ML functions, are expected to have benefited top-line growth. SNOW has an innovative portfolio that includes Document AI and Cortex, which are expected to be in public preview soon, strengthens growth prospects.An expanding partner base, which includes the likes of Mistral AI, NVIDIA NVDA, Microsoft MSFT, Amazon AMZN, ServiceNow, Cognizant and Dell Technologies, has been driving Snowflake’s growth trajectory.Snowflake’s partnership with Microsoft enabled product integrations across AI, low code/no code application development, data governance and more. Snowflake-Microsoft integration is empowering data scientists and developers with industry-leading AI solutions, building integrations between the Data Cloud and Azure ML, and leveraging integrations with Azure OpenAI and Microsoft Cognitive Services.Snowflake-NVIDIA partnered to help businesses harness their data for Generative AI based on the NVIDIA NeMo platform for developing large language models and NVIDIA GPU-accelerated computing.Moreover, this March, Snowflake inked an expanded collaboration with NVIDIA that brings together the full-stack NVIDIA accelerated platform with the trusted data foundation and secure AI of Snowflake’s Data Cloud.Additionally, Snowflake’s achievement of FedRAMP high authorization on the AWS GovCloud now enables it to handle sensitive and classified data for the Federal Government. This accomplishment enhances Snowflake’s credibility in serving government entities.In fourth-quarter fiscal 2024, Snowflake added 83 customers, with product revenues exceeding $5 million in the trailing 12 months, increasing from 75 customers in the third quarter. The trend is expected to have continued in the fiscal first quarter.However, higher investments in AI-related initiatives are expected to drive the cost of revenues. Increased consumption-based commissions worth roughly $30 million are expected to hurt profits in fiscal 2025. Snowflake’s strong portfolio, with the growing adoption of solutions like Snowpark, significantly boosts its prospects. Despite macroeconomic headwinds, we believe that an expanding partner base enhances its attractiveness to investors.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.

Not only that, but their overall trajectory toward a soft-landing for the economy has led the stock market to new record highs.

We now start a new trading week with the Dow above 40K for the first time. In fact, market indices are drifting higher from here. The Dow is currently up another +30 points, the S&P 500 is +10 and the Nasdaq is +50 points at this hour. We have few, if any, major economic reports expected in this last full trading week before Memorial Day Weekend — compared to last week’s busy time period and next week, which brings us the latest Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) a week from this Friday. What we will see plenty of is Fed member appearances. Not only do we expect half a dozen Fed presidents and governors to give speeches this week — seven for just today and tomorrow — but we’ll also see the release of the Fed minutes from the latest FOMC meeting from April 30-May 1st. We’ve been at the same Fed funds rate level since July of last year, so any “reading of the tea leaves” will have to include no projected rate cuts likely for June, when many analysts expected cuts to commence.

The first-quarter performance of NVIDIA is anticipated to reflect the continued strength of its datacenter end market. This segment is likely to have experienced substantial growth, driven by the rising demand for generative artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models that utilize NVIDIA’s Hopper and Ampere architecture graphic processing units (GPUs).

The global generative AI market size is anticipated to reach $967.6 billion by 2032, according to a new report by Fortune Business Insights. The market is expected to expand at a CAGR of 39.6% from 2024 to 2032. ChatGPT’s adoption by enterprises has shown its value across sectors such as marketing, customer service and healthcare.

Wall Street Bulls Look Optimistic About Nvidia (NVDA): Should You Buy?,20/5/2024 13:30,Zacks Equity Research20 May 2024 at 6:30 am·4-min read,"The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though? Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Nvidia (NVDA). Nvidia currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.20, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 41 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.20 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy. Of the 41 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 36 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 87.8% and 4.9% of all recommendations. Brokerage Recommendation Trends for NVDA Check price target & stock forecast for Nvidia here>>>The ABR suggests buying Nvidia, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation. Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation. This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements. Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.

What do Nvidia options cost into earnings?,20/5/2024 13:28,Investing.com20 May 2024 at 6:28 am·1-min read,"As Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) approaches its earnings announcement, investors are keen to understand the cost and value of its options. According to a recent analysis by Piper Sandler, Nvidia's near-term options appear slightly overpriced but not excessively so. Piper Sandler's report focuses on evaluating whether NVDA options are ""fair"" by comparing their prices to volatility forecasts rather than past volatility. For options expiring in one month, implied volatility (IV) stands at 53.77%, which is marginally higher than the ""fair value"" of 47.09%. This difference is about a 0.66 standard error. Looking at longer-dated options, the prices align more closely with their fair values, suggesting they are appropriately priced. However, Piper Sandler notes a noticeable discrepancy in the cost of upside versus downside protection. ""IV at 115% (80%) moneyness is about 55.12% (56.23%), whereas it ""should be"" 47.25% (59.57%), about a 1.1 (-0.18) standard error signal,"" explains the firm. This analysis suggests that while Nvidia options are generally fairly priced, there is a slight overvaluation of upside potential. In contrast, Piper Sandler said its analysis shows that options for the S&P 500 ""remain cheap across the surface,"" with none of the implied volatility quotes exceeding their fair values. Elsewhere on Monday, analysts at Bank of America said Nvidia options are pricing in an 8.5% implied move for Q1 earnings, much lower than the reaction to three of the last five quarters.

BTC traded at around $67,000 while ETH held steady about $3,100. The wider digital asset market as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) has added 0.3% in the last 24 hours. This week, attention will turn to the SEC's decision on the approval of ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with the deadline for a response to VanEck's and Ark/21 Shares' applications due on May 23 and May 24, respectively. Traders may be keeping their powder dry until then. Traders are also going to be eyeing Nvidia's earnings, scheduled for Wednesday. Bitcoin trades strongly in correlation with Nvidia, as do artificial intelligence-themed tokens, which surged in February as the chip designer reported better-than-expected earnings. NVDA has risen over 90% year-to-date, with analysts expecting the company to report a big increase in revenue for the quarter ending in April. The direct correlation between Nvidia and ether market movement isn't as strong as it once was during the mining boom. Still, the rising tide of bitcoin and AI tokens – should Nvidia's earnings remain strong – will likely lift all boats. Genesis will return 77% of customer assets, worth $3 billion in cash and crypto, to its creditors. Parent company DCG will not be among them. The lender's holding company filed for bankruptcy in January 2023 following the fallout from events in the crypto market the year before.

Morning bid: Buoyant start to 'Nvidia week',20/5/2024 10:04,Reuters20 May 2024 at 3:04 am·3-min read,"A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan World markets, heady on hopes for renewed U.S. disinflation and another attempt by China at shoring up its ailing housing sector, entered the new week on the front foot as attention switched back to the artificial intelligence boom. AI-bellwether Nvidia reports quarterly earnings on Wednesday with the bar to impress the investor gallery as high as ever - its stock has almost doubled again this year so far after tripling in 2023. And that's with good reason - the chipmaking giant's revenue is expected to have more than trebled to $24.8 billion from $7.2 billion a year earlier, with earnings per share soaring to $5.57 from $1.09, according to LSEG data. As a curious taster on Friday, Advanced Micro Devices gained more than 1% as Microsoft said it plans to offer its cloud computing customers a platform of AMD AI chips that will compete with components made by Nvidia. Reddit, meantime, rose 10% following a partnership with OpenAI to bring its content to ChatGPT. But it's not been all about AI this year as still-buoyant U.S. growth and near double-digit aggregate annual earnings gains meet persistent optimism of lower interest rates later in the year. Treasury yields backed up a touch on Friday after the week's relief on April consumer inflation was dampened by irksome import prices and stubborn Federal Reserve soundings, not least from known-hawk Michelle Bowman. But there's still 40 basis points of easing priced into this year's Fed futures strip and an 80% chance of a move by September.

Spot gold hit a record high of $2,453.30 (£1,931.61) an ounce soon after the Iranian president Ebrahim Raisi was killed in a helicopter crash. His death has added to tensions in the Middle East, which analysts said increases the appeal of the metal, which is considered a safe haven in times of turmoil. Bullion has also received a boost as traders have been increasing bets in recent sessions that the Federal Reserve could reduce borrowing costs as early as September, a scenario that would bolster gold as it doesn’t pay interest. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""Demand for the safe-haven asset has surged as investors have been digesting news of the death of Iran’s president Ebrahim Raisi who is believed to have been killed with others including foreign minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian in a helicopter crash.

At 09:35 ET (13:35 GMT), Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 16 points, or 0.1%, while S&P 500 rose 5 points, or 0.1%, and NASDAQ Composite rose 50 points, or 0.3%. The focus this week is squarely on more cues from the Federal Reserve on the future path of interest rates, with the minutes of the central bank’s late-April meeting due on Wednesday. Fed officials had kept rates steady at that meeting and warned that they needed more confidence that inflation was coming down. But Fed Chair Jerome Powell had also said that rates were eventually expected to come down in 2024. Several Fed officials are also set to speak this week, with particular focus on the members of the Fed’s rate-setting committee. The Fed cues come amid increased focus on the bank’s plans to cut interest rates, especially after slightly softer inflation readings for April pushed up hopes for a September rate cut. Beyond more cues on interest rates, markets were also awaiting purchasing managers index data for May, which is set to offer more cues on U.S. business activity. Any signs of cooling could factor into the outlook for interest rate cuts. Wall Street indexes made new highs last week, but they were seen running out of momentum amid uncertainty over just when the Fed could begin trimming rates. Overheated valuations, particularly in the technology sector, and cooling hype over artificial intelligence also limited just how high indexes could push.

Wall Street bets on stellar quarterly results from Nvidia,20/5/2024 13:47,Arsheeya  BajwaUpdated 20 May 2024 at 6:47 am·3-min read,"By Arsheeya Bajwa (Reuters) -Wall Street is betting on a blowout quarterly report from Nvidia on Wednesday, with its stock near record highs as investors look for evidence that the AI chipmaker can maintain its explosive growth and stay ahead of rivals. The results will be the latest test for Wall Street's picks-and-shovels trade that has turned Nvidia into the biggest winner of the generative AI boom, thanks to its chips that are essential in powering technology such as Google's Gemini to OpenAI's ChatGPT. ""There is a lot riding on Nvidia's earnings. It is the most important stock in the sector,"" said Will Rhind, founder and CEO of GraniteShares, which runs an ETF that invests in the chip firm. A more than six-fold surge in its shares since the start of 2023 has made Nvidia Wall Street's third-most valuable firm, worth more than $2.30 trillion. Its 89% stock surge so far in 2024 has helped lift the broader market, and Nvidia now accounts for 5% of the S&P 500, according to LSEG data. Analyst expectations for Nvidia's future earnings have climbed even faster than its shares. That last left the stock trading at about 35 times expected earnings, down from a peak of over 80 last June, according to LSEG data. Nvidia's staggering valuation might yet have room to grow. ""It is undervalued relative to where forecasts are going,"" Rhind said. Analysts on average see Nvidia reporting a 242% jump in revenue to $24.60 billion for the fiscal quarter ending in April, according to LSEG data as of May 17. Its sales in the second quarter are expected to rise almost 97%, the data showed.

"Walmart, Target, Amazon and Nvidia are part of Zacks Earnings Preview",20/5/2024 8:38,Zacks Equity Research20 May 2024 at 1:38 am·7-min read,"Chicago, IL – May 20, 2024 – Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week’s list includes Walmart’s WMT, Target TGT, Amazon AMZN and Nvidia NVDA. Walmart’s beat-and-raise quarterly release should ordinarily provide favorable read-throughs for Target, which is scheduled to report results before the market’s open on Wednesday, May 22nd. But the two companies have different business models, and that makes expectations off target. To start, Walmart has effectively added a technological component to its well-established reputation for value. Walmart’s digital prowess has allowed it to offer a variety of convenient shopping options, allowing it to gain market share, with mostly high-income households finding the company’s service offerings hard to resist. The company’s revenues in the quarter increased +5.8% (in constant currency), with digital sales up +21% from the same period last year. Another major point of distinction between the two retailers is their merchandise mix, with Walmart heavily weighted towards groceries and Target towards discretionary merchandise. Walmart enjoyed mid-single-digit same-store sales growth in the latest quarter, with the aforementioned high-income households attracted to the retailer for its convenient delivery and pick-up options. Walmart’s general merchandise, which can roughly be considered comparable to the bulk of Target’s merchandise mix, continued to show soft results, with same-store sales down in the low single digits in the quarter. Most analysts expect Target to show low single-digit same-store sales declines but also expect some sequential improvement in the trend line Target is expected to bring in $2.05 in EPS on $24.5 billion in revenues, with earnings unchanged from the year-ago period on -3.2% lower revenues. The stock was up big following each of the last two quarterly releases in March and November, as can be seen in the one-year performance chart below relative to Walmart and the Zacks Retail sector. With respect to the Retail sector 2024 Q1 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 23 of the 34 retailers in the S&P 500 index. Regular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, which is unlike the placement of the space in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard & Poor’s standard industry classification. The Zacks Retail sector includes not only Walmart, Target, and other traditional retailers, but also online vendors like Amazon and restaurant players. Total Q1 earnings for these 23 retailers that have reported are up +38.7% from the same period last year on +6.4% higher revenues, with 69.6% beating EPS estimates and 56.5% beating revenue estimates. Walmart beat both EPS and revenue estimates, but Home Depot missed on revenues. Aside from these two ‘conventional’ retailers, the scorecard at this stage primarily reflects the Q1 performance of the digital players and restaurant operators. As the above beats data shows, these companies have struggled to beat EPS and revenue estimates in Q1.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-target-amazon-nvidia-part-083800980.html,NVDA

""All in, checks continue to point to >$1B in upside in April and $2B in July.,"" stated Barclays. ""We believe the company can capture incremental revenue upside due to pricing on H200, which will start shipping in the July quarter.""

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is due to headline this week's corporate earnings calendar, with the maker of artificial intelligence-optimized chips expected to report another quarter of surging revenues. Elsewhere, several Fed officials are set to speak on Monday, as investors attempt to gauge to road ahead for the central bank's monetary policy. 1. Futures point higher U.S. stock futures were broadly higher on Monday, suggesting an extension in a rally in the prior session that drove the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average to its first-ever close above the 40,000 level. By 03:48 ET (07:48 GMT), the Dow futures contract had gained 19 points or 0.1%, S&P 500 futures had risen by 4 points or 0.1%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had advanced by 22 points or 0.1%. Recent data indicating a possible cooling in the U.S. economy have alleviated some persistent inflation concerns, fueling hopes that the Federal Reserve will start to bring interest rates down from more than two-decade highs as soon as September. Along with the Dow, the benchmark S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite all touched record marks last week. The durability of the strength on Wall Street will likely be tested by a fresh batch of corporate results this week, including quarterly returns from artificial intelligence darling Nvidia (see below). Durable goods and consumer sentiment data will also be in focus as markets hunt for more evidence that growth is moderating enough to give the Fed justification for rolling out rate cuts this year. 2. Nvidia earnings ahead this week Nvidia is set to highlight the earnings calendar this week, with traders keen to see if the maker of AI-specialized graphics processing units will once again post spiking revenues at its all-important data center unit.

In February, Nvidia said it expects revenues to jump to $24 billion in the first quarter, with Chief Executive Jensen Huang noting that he believed ""accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point."" Comments from Huang will also likely be in the spotlight. Nvidia faces competition from rival chipmakers like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), as well as supply chain constraints and geopolitical tensions that threaten AI chip exports from the U.S. to China.

Wall Street hit record highs last week, with U.S. stock index futures rising further in Asian trade on Monday. Focus this week is also on more cues from the minutes of the Fed’s late-April meeting, as well as addresses from a slew of Fed officials. China’s Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 and Shanghai Composite indexes rose 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively, on Monday, extending gains from last week. Both indexes were at seven and eight-month highs. Beijing had rolled out a string of supportive measures for the economy- specifically the property market last week, as it moved to shore up a sluggish economic recovery. China had loosened home buying restrictions across several major cities, and had also reportedly instructed state governments to begin buying up houses. China also kept its benchmark loan prime rate at record lows on Monday. But gains in Chinese markets were limited, especially after middling economic readings for April. Retail spending and capital investment in the country still remained weak, likely necessitating more stimulus measures from Beijing. Fears of a renewed trade war with Washington also weighed, after Beijing banned some U.S. firms from importing and exporting activities related to China. The move was seen as potential retaliation for a recent increase in U.S. tariffs on key Chinese industries. Tech-heavy indexes were among the better performers for the day.

Still, for the quarter that ended in April, the numbers will be explosive as its chips remain in high demand for data centers used in generative artificial intelligence. Analysts polled by FactSet see earnings per share soaring 474% to $5.22, with revenue up 241% to $24.5 billion. That would be down from the prior quarter's 765% earnings jump and 265% revenue surge. Meanwhile, the stock has leapt 87% so far in 2024 and is up about 200% from a year ago. Nvidia is now the third most valuable company in the world, boasting a market cap of $2.3 trillion that trails only Apple and Microsoft. But shares have essentially been flat over the last two months. Nvidia’s unveiling in March of its new Blackwell chip has prompted some analysts to expect a slowdown during the transition from its older H100 chips to the next-generation models, which are expected to become publicly available later this year. In a note on Thursday, analysts at Bank of America flagged this deceleration as a potential source of volatility in Nvidia stock after the earnings come out. While BofA sees Nvidia reporting strong numbers compared with the Wall Street consensus, analysts expect the company's second-quarter guidance to mark the first time sequential growth will be less than 10%. Meanwhile, it sees gross margins shrinking from about 77% in the first quarter to a ""more normalized"" range of 75%-76% in the following quarter. ""However, even if NVDA were to potentially deliver on these bullish expectations, the stock could still react unfavorably as bears will likely complain that: 1) NVDA QoQ sales growth will decelerate to 'only' 7-8% QoQ in FQ2 (Jul) outlook, well below the mid-teens or better the last few quarters, 2) [gross margin] peaking and decline is a sign of pricing pressure, unfavorable mix (more China H20 shipments and/or more inference units) and slowing demand/easing supply,"" the note said.

These stocks ripped even higher than GameStop in the meme rally,17/5/2024 20:18,Ines Ferré·Senior Business ReporterUpdated 17 May 2024 at 1:18 pm·2-min read,"GameStop (GME) and AMC (AMC) weren't the only stocks caught up in this week's meme craze. While shares of the short-lived rally's flag bearers continued to unravel Friday, smaller meme-related equities ended the week with higher gains. For example, EV-related startup Faraday Future (FFIE) soared as much as 122% Friday before crashing into red territory. The stock still gained more than 2,000% over the past five days. Over the past 24 hours, Faraday Future was the third-most-mentioned stock on Reddit's WallStreetBets forum behind the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) and Nvidia (NVDA), according to web data company Thinknum. Retail trader and YouTuber Matt Kohrs told Yahoo Finance, ""Similar to 2021 [during the meme rally], people seem to be targeting equities with high short interest,"" noting Faraday Future's short interest sits at roughly 92% of the float. Other heavily shorted stocks that were volatile during the session include Crown ElectroKinetics (CRKN). The Oregon-based smart glass micro-cap company gained more than 325% over the past five days. Greenwave Technology Solutions (GWAV) was up more than 280% for the week. The small, Virginia-based metal recycling company added to prior session gains as shares of GameStop and AMC were unraveling. MicroCloud Hologram (HOLO), a solar play, was up as much as 8% Friday while GameStop and AMC were falling to cap off a volatile week. The micro-cap rose about 21% over the past five days. This week's meme action started on Monday following the re-emergence of Keith Gill, also known as ""Roaring Kitty,"" whose bull case on GameStop ignited the meme stock rally back in 2021.

Market Awaits Comments From Key Fed Official,17/5/2024 14:53,Zacks Equity Research17 May 2024 at 7:53 am·3-min read,"In an eventful week for the markets, this morning we take a break. Aside from Leading Economic Indicators in the U.S. for April (expected to be down -0.3%, same as the previous month), we’ll hear from Fed Governor Christopher Waller after today’s open. But neither of these is expected to move markets on their own, or even collectively. We know this because the biggest news of the week — Wednesday’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) report — has already sent market levels toward near-record highs. Yesterday, we closed lower on the major indices. However, this was after two pronounced higher closes on Tuesday — ahead of the CPI report — and Wednesday — afterward. Obviously, CPI showed slimming inflation figures month over month and over a multi-year read, which brought market participants to conclude that inflation is indeed being curbed. After a couple months of higher-than-expected inflation metrics — likely a wrinkle in the longer-term downward trajectory — there was finally some certainty regarding inflation levels. You didn’t have to tell traders and investors twice. The moment the “soft landing” narrative resurfaced, bullish sentiment in the stock market commenced. This was backed by a lowering of bond yields, particularly on the 10-year (its lowest level in a month) and 2-year rates, which helped fuel the rally further. The Dow is up +1% from the start of the week, the S&P 500 +1.5%, the Nasdaq nearly +2% and the small-cap Russell 2000 +1.75%. Though yesterday was down a tad, we remain near all-time highs on all four indices. The final “Magnificent 7” stock to report earnings happens next Wednesday, when NVIDIA NVDA reports fiscal Q1 earnings. Despite the +95% growth year to date in the stock (and 200%+ from a year ago), NVIDIA remains a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), albeit with a Value score of F. This speaks directly to the pending ubiquity of AI technology, of which NVIDIA is positioned expertly — especially in terms of visual graphics, which is next-level AI. If you had bought NVIDIA five years ago — a year before peak pandemic — you’d be up +2300% right now. This is a common reason your financial advisor has a big smile on their face. Aside from NVIDIA earnings next week, we’ll see New and Existing Home Sales numbers, S&P flash PMI Services and Manufacturing, Durable Goods and Weekly Jobless Claims. It’s clearly a slower time, as Q1 earnings season otherwise lowers to simmer. We don’t get a new Fed meeting for another five weeks — so lower inflation metrics have that much time to shrink to levels sufficient for interest rates to lower — and even the next Jobs Week is three weeks away. The question now is: have market participants spent all their ammo driving indices higher, or will there be some other perceived good news to ingest before the summer months are upon us?

Revenues are projected to reach $24.27 billion, increasing 237.5% from the same quarter last year. Over the past 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been adjusted upward by 0.9% to its current level. This demonstrates the covering analysts' collective reassessment of their initial projections during this period.

This serves as a significant indicator for predicting potential investor actions regarding the stock. Empirical research has consistently demonstrated a robust correlation between trends in earnings estimate revision and the short-term price performance of a stock. While investors typically use consensus earnings and revenue estimates as indicators of quarterly business performance, exploring analysts' projections for specific key metrics can offer valuable insights. In light of this perspective, let's dive into the average estimates of certain Nvidia metrics that are commonly tracked and forecasted by Wall Street analysts. According to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Revenue- Gaming' should come in at $2.63 billion. The estimate points to a change of +17.3% from the year-ago quarter.

Investors have some high expectations for some of the key companies reporting this week such as Nvidia and Marks and Spencer. Here's what to look out for: The darling of AI and technology investors will report results from its first quarter of fiscal year 2025 on 22 May. The AI boom would not be possible without the chips from Nvidia, with the chipmaker seeing shares surge by 239% last year. With demand far outstripping supply for its graphics processing units, investors will want to know if Nvidia — the last of the Mag 7 to report — can keep driving the AI-related rally the market enjoyed over the past year. Nvidia is anticipated to report earnings of $5.49 per share for the current quarter, marking an increase of 403.7% from the same quarter last year.

Super Micro Computer and GameStop have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,17/5/2024 12:42,Zacks Equity Research17 May 2024 at 5:42 am·11-min read,"Chicago, IL – May 17, 2024 – Zacks Equity Research shares Super Micro Computer SMCI as the Bull of the Day and GameStop GME as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK, Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund XLU and Schwab U.S. REIT ETF SCHH. Here is a synopsis of all five stocks. Super Micro Computer reported their March quarterly earnings on April 30 and inspired analysts to once again boost growth estimates for the provider of key datacenter infrastructure in the early innings of the AI boom.After SMCI delivered strong numbers and guidance, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate for the current fiscal year (ends June) rose 6% from $22.15 to $23.51, representing 99% annual growth.And next fiscal year jumped over 17% from $28.95 to $34, which would equate to a 44.6% advance.These rising profits are being drawn from equally impressive growth on the topline, with the current year approaching a 110% leap to nearly $15 billion and next year's projections are stalking $24 billion for another 60% surge. As a devoted NVIDIA investor, I like to remind others that ""as goes GPU demand, so goes datacenter build-out."" And just as investors continue to doubt NVIDIA's growth as having any sustainability, so too they miss its little satellites profiting from the boom.It seems it was only a few months ago when SMCI was a $300 stock. That's because it was only 4 months ago when, in late January, the company pre-announced December quarter results and the stock launched 36% the next day.I first wrote about the ""shock and awe"" of a datacenter architect most investors had never heard of in my Bull of the Day from January 28. Here's some of what I shared...They call themselves ""Supermicro"" and describe their business simply and powerfully...Supermicro is a global technology leader committed to delivering first-to-market innovation for Enterprise, Cloud, AI, Metaverse, and 5G Telco/Edge IT Infrastructure. We are a Rack-Scale Total IT Solutions provider that designs and builds an environmentally-friendly and energy-saving portfolio of servers, storage systems, switches, software, along with global support services.And on January 19 they stunned Wall Street with preliminary revenue of $3.6 billion, which tore through prior guidance of $2.7-2.9 billion, representing 100% year-over-year growth for the company's fiscal Q2.Earnings for the quarter are projected to spike to $5.55 a share, topping analysts estimates of $4.50 EPS.The company cited strong market and end customer demand for its rack-scale, AI and Total IT Solutions.For its current fiscal year which ends in June, Supermicro is on pace to deliver 53% topline growth to nearly $11 billion and 40% EPS growth to cross $16.50.And even after the huge rally in SMCI shares this month, with projected 15% revenue growth to cross $12.5 billion next year the stock still trades at only 2 times sales!(end of excerpt from my Jan 28 article) What should jump out is that less than four months ago we were talking about $11 billion and $12.5 billion on the Supermicro toplines for this year and next. Now those numbers are $15 billion and $24 billion!And the stock still trades for 2X sales as I talked about in my video from May 7, where I also discuss SMCI volatility since the surge to $1,200 as investors debate whether or not this is all just an ""AI bubble.""In that video, I explain why SMCI dropped 23% on April 19. The reason revolves around expectations for another stunner preannouncement (like in January) that didn't come. So expectations and fears clashed as hopes were dashed.But I also said the storm is over, estimates are still rising, and investors should be looking to buy under $800. You got two more chances this week.Be sure to watch the 7-minute video to see the key price support level that held after earnings and gave way to a 16% rally on May 15 to $950.With NVIDIA earnings on deck May 22, we can look forward to another set of data points about the AI debate. My bet is that both NVDA and SMCI will be trading above $1,000 very soon as the boom continues and the bulls win.Disclosure: I own shares of NVDA and SMCI for the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio. GameStop delivered weak sales and profits in late March for their Q4 fiscal 2024 (ended January) and shares subsequently declined by over one-third from above $15 to $10. Of course that's nothing compared to the moon launch the stock saw this week to $60, but we'll cover that mania after we look at the fundamentals. The Q4 numbers propelled analysts to further lower growth estimates, with the Zacks Consensus for both top and bottom lines turning negative on an annual basis for fiscal 2025 (began February).

5 Must-Buy High-Flying U.S. Giants on Favorable Economic Data,17/5/2024 12:16,Nalak Das17 May 2024 at 5:16 am·6-min read,"On May 15, U.S. stock markets soared following the release of two key economic data. Market participants’ confidence in risky assets like equities was boosted as expectations of the first reduction in the Fed fund rate in September heightened. The Department of Labor reported that the consumer price index (CPI) for the month of April rose 0.3% month-over-month, below the consensus estimate and March’s reading of 0.4%. Year over year, CPI increased 3.4%, in line with expectations. The core CPI (excluding volatile food and energy items) rose 0.3% month-over-month in April, after rising 0.4% in the previous three months. April’s data showed the smallest monthly increase since December 2023. Year over year, core CPI increased 3.6%, marking the lowest monthly increase since April 2021. The Department of Commerce reported that retail sales in April remained flat month over month, missing the consensus estimate of a rise of 0.4%. The reading for March was also revised downward to 0.6% from 0.7% reported earlier. However, year over year, retail sales increased 3% in April. Core retail sales (excluding auto) rose 0.2% month over month in April, in line with the consensus estimate. The metric for March was revised downward to 0.9% from 1.1% reported earlier. The Department of Commerce reported that U.S. GDP grew at a 1.6% annualized rate in first-quarter 2024, well below the consensus estimate of 2.5%. Moreover, the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) reported that both manufacturing and services PMIs (purchasing managers’ index) contracted in April. Weak retail sales and lower-than-expected CPI data are also in line with this trend. Following the release of CPI and retail sales data, the CME FedWatch shows a 73.2% probability that the Fed will reduce the benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points in September. The interest rate derivative tool is also showing a 94.5% probability that the central bank will reduce the interest rate by at least 50 basis points by the end of 2024. Notably, the Fed fund rate is currently at its 23-year high in the range of 5.25-5.5%. We have narrowed our search to five U.S. corporate behemoths (market capital > $100 billion) that have provided more than 20% returns year to date with more upside left.

After making huge profits on his NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) stake, which he bought in the fourth quarter of 2022, billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller cut his stake in the AI chips company by 72% in the first quarter of 2024, a move that surprised many. Insider Monkey's data shows that Druckenmiller loaded up on 582,915 NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares during the fourth quarter of 2022 at an average price of $146.65 per share. Near the end of the first quarter of this year, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock was hovering around $902 per share. Stanley Druckenmiller also liquidated his call options on NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) which he'd bought in the fourth quarter of 2023 for $242 million. Despite the massive bull run in NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares, Wall Street analysts are continuing to shower the stock with bullish ratings. UBS earlier this month published a list of stocks that are set to benefit from the massive surge in the AI industry, which the firm believes could touch $400 billion in revenue in the next three years. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) was part of the list. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is continuing to refresh and update its AI chips product line as demand is skyrocketing. Analysts expect NVIDIA Corp's (NASDAQ:NVDA) H200 chips and Spectrum-X platform to offer cutting-edge processing and networking solutions for companies that are making generative AI software and applications. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) bulls believe that the company's growth catalysts are strong enough to justify its currently high valuation metrics. After all NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) still enjoys an 80% market share in the GPU industry, which its products are expected to see high demand in other industries, like automotive, gaming and mobile devices. NVIDIA Corp's (NASDAQ:NVDA) ""real world"" AI segment is thriving. Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently revealed that his company currently has 35,000 H100 chips. Tesla also plans to become the third-biggest NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) customer as Tesla plans to have 85,000 Nvidia H100 chips by the end of 2024 to train its AI models. However, some circles have voiced concerns on NVIDIA Corp's (NASDAQ:NVDA) valuation following the eye-popping stock price gains NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) has enjoyed over the past few months. This comes as major NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) customers like Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Amazon and Google begin to mull producing AI chips in-house. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is also outsourcing its production to Taiwan Semiconductor, which makes NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) vulnerable to any geopolitical risks especially when President Biden is upping the ante against China with new traffics and hawkish tone. Wolfe Research in recently replaced Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) with its competitor AMD in its Alpha List. Wolfe Research cited NVIDIA Corp's (NASDAQ:NVDA) massive stock price gains year to date as a reason behind this move.

Microsoft Unveils AMD-Powered AI Chips To Rival Nvidia: Report,17/5/2024 12:05,Shivani Kumaresan17 May 2024 at 5:05 am·2-min read,"Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is planning to introduce Advanced Micro Devices Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMD) artificial intelligence chips to its cloud computing customers, aiming to rival Nvidia Corp’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) components. This significant development will be detailed further at the upcoming Build developer conference next week, according to a report from Reuters. The tech giant’s Azure cloud service will integrate AMD’s MI300X AI chips, offering an alternative to Nvidia’s high-demand H100 GPUs. This move is designed to alleviate the difficulty many companies face in securing Nvidia’s GPUs due to their popularity in the data center chip market for AI applications. Azure’s integration of AMD’s flagship chips is expected to boost its AI capabilities, enabling customers to build and run large-scale AI models.

Here's why investors seem to be hesitant to own AMD stock: Mizuho,17/5/2024 10:18,Investing.com17 May 2024 at 3:18 am·2-min read,"Investors are growing increasingly skeptical about owning AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) stock, a Mizuho desk analyst highlighted in a new note. “Why add AMD if I own NVDA and AVGO here that are cheaper and feel much lower risk?” appears to be the key pushback among market participants, the analyst said. The chipmaker’s shares rose to an intraday high of $168 on Thursday, amid a broader surge in the technology sector driven by the recently released softer-than-expected inflation data. It seemed like a short squeeze was affecting much of the tech market, the analyst noted. Notably, AMD’s chipmaking peer Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) Technology was up 6-7% at one point despite the lack of any specific news or events. Meanwhile, AMD remains a significant short position for many East Coast hedge funds, and numerous long-only (LO) investors are steering clear of it ahead of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s Blackwell launch later this year. “Stock feels like a plane crash survivor on a life raft in middle of a massive ocean just looking for land,” the analyst wrote. “I remain a bull and love the risk reward if you have patience and duration (think 6-9 months). But I get the worry, hesitancy and concerns amongst investors.” Mizuho’s expert also said that AMD “could be the next Dell (NYSE:DELL),” another major hedge fund short that surged on a bullish preview from Morgan Stanley ahead of their earnings at the end of May. Meanwhile, new reports suggest that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) plans to promote AMD's MI300X GPUs for generative AI at their upcoming Build conference. While it’s known that Microsoft uses AMD's MI300 GPUs to balance Nvidia, recent negative calls in March and April implied that Microsoft was cutting orders to shift funds to Nvidia’s Blackwell GPUs, set for release later this year. “I would watch AMD today, and while this MSFT news itself is unlikely some major catalyst, any focus by MSFT on AMD’s MI300 next week to me feels like a positive catalyst as the cons view is MSFT will cut MI300 orders this yr and AMD will miss MI300 rev bogeys of $9-10B next yr,” the analyst concluded.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-investors-seem-hesitant-101833984.html,NVDA

Just in time, chipmaking juggernaut Nvidia comes a-calling. The company’s report is way at the end of the regular earnings season — nearly a month after Meta’s. And Nvidia’s results have only grown in importance as the company’s value has ballooned. Its market cap is $2.3 trillion, and it’s now the third-weightiest stock in the S&P 500 behind Microsoft and Apple.

Bull of the Day: Super Micro Computer (SMCI),17/5/2024 9:20,Kevin Cook17 May 2024 at 2:20 am·3-min read,"Super Micro Computer (SMCI) reported their March quarterly earnings on April 30 and inspired analysts to once again boost growth estimates for the provider of key datacenter infrastructure in the early innings of the AI boom.After SMCI delivered strong numbers and guidance, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate for the current fiscal year (ends June) rose 6% from $22.15 to $23.51, representing 99% annual growth.And next fiscal year jumped over 17% from $28.95 to $34, which would equate to a 44.6% advance.These rising profits are being drawn from equally impressive growth on the topline, with the current year approaching a 110% leap to nearly $15 billion and next year's projections are stalking $24 billion for another 60% surge.I Remember Ye Yay HighAs a devoted NVIDIA (NVDA) investor, I like to remind others that ""as goes GPU demand, so goes datacenter build-out."" And just as investors continue to doubt NVIDIA's growth as having any sustainability, so too they miss its little satellites profiting from the boom.It seems it was only a few months ago when SMCI was a $300 stock. That's because it was only 4 months ago when, in late January, the company pre-announced December quarter results and the stock launched 36% the next day.I first wrote about the ""shock and awe"" of a datacenter architect most investors had never heard of in my Bull of the Day from January 28. Here's some of what I shared...They call themselves ""Supermicro"" and describe their business simply and powerfully...Supermicro is a global technology leader committed to delivering first-to-market innovation for Enterprise, Cloud, AI, Metaverse, and 5G Telco/Edge IT Infrastructure. We are a Rack-Scale Total IT Solutions provider that designs and builds an environmentally-friendly and energy-saving portfolio of servers, storage systems, switches, software, along with global support services.And on January 19 they stunned Wall Street with preliminary revenue of $3.6 billion, which tore through prior guidance of $2.7-2.9 billion, representing 100% year-over-year growth for the company's fiscal Q2.Earnings for the quarter are projected to spike to $5.55 a share, topping analysts estimates of $4.50 EPS.The company cited strong market and end customer demand for its rack-scale, AI and Total IT Solutions.For its current fiscal year which ends in June, Supermicro is on pace to deliver 53% topline growth to nearly $11 billion and 40% EPS growth to cross $16.50.And even after the huge rally in SMCI shares this month, with projected 15% revenue growth to cross $12.5 billion next year the stock still trades at only 2 times sales!(end of excerpt from my Jan 28 article)AI Boom, or AI Bubble?What should jump out is that less than four months ago we were talking about $11 billion and $12.5 billion on the Supermicro toplines for this year and next. Now those numbers are $15 billion and $24 billion!And the stock still trades for 2X sales as I talked about in my video from May 7, where I also discuss SMCI volatility since the surge to $1,200 as investors debate whether or not this is all just an ""AI bubble.""In that video, I explain why SMCI dropped 23% on April 19. The reason revolves around expectations for another stunner preannounce (like in January) that didn't come.

A slow euro area recovery appears to be underway after six straight quarters of stagnant or negative growth, U.S. inflation just resumed its downward trend and China grew faster than expected in Q1. So, global PMIs should stay on the right side of the 50 divider between expansion and contraction. Yet steep U.S. tariff increases on Chinese imports from electric vehicle batteries to computer chips highlight a fragile outlook for global trade and growth. China vows retaliation. Manufacturers in Germany, Europe's biggest economy, are already experiencing shifts in world trade and geopolitics. Heightened trade tensions - with a U.S. election looming - could hurt them further, upend China's recovery and reignite U.S. inflation. Global PMIs are pointing up for now.

Investors will be mainly focusing on growth trends in Nvidia’s data center segment and any updates on the recently announced Blackwell platform. Wall Street analysts project Nvidia's revenue to reach $24.65 billion for Q1 FY2025, up from the previous quarter and more than tripling from the year-ago period, according to consensus estimates by Visible Alpha. Net income is expected to soar to $12.87 billion, notably higher than the $2.04 billion profit recorded a year ago and up from the final quarter of FY2024. On a per-share basis, diluted earnings are anticipated to be $5.17, a sharp increase from 82 cents in the year-ago period. However, a key focus in Nvidia's upcoming earnings report will be its data center segment. Nvidia has positioned itself as an early beneficiary of the AI boom, leading to rapid growth in this division. The unprecedented demand for Nvidia's advanced computing chips, which are specialized for running AI workloads, has significantly driven this expansion. Citi analysts project Nvidia's April quarter total and data center sales to be $24 billion and $21 billion, respectively, in line with expectations. They believe buy-side estimates are higher at approximately $26 billion for total sales and $23 billion for data center sales. For the July quarter, Citi models total sales of $27.5 billion, compared to the Street's estimate of $26.5 billion and buy-side expectations of around $28 billion. “We expect smaller beats vs the prior few quarters on larger numbers, shorter H100 lead times, and gross margin normalization before GB200 volume ramps in 1H25,” analysts at the Wall Street giant said in a note. “Going into earnings, we believe investors are focused on a) GB200 ramp/pipeline, b) potential air pocket in AI demand in 2H24, c) B200’s impact on LT gross margins, d) power constraints on AI data center rollouts, and e) sovereign AI&China H20 demand,” they added. Meanwhile, in their pre-earnings report, Piper Sandler analysts said they continue to see strong demand for Nvidia’s data center products and believe the company is poised for another “beat-and-raise quarter.”",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-earnings-preview-heres-citi-045443241.html,NVDA

Cherney SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Microsoft said on Thursday it plans to offer its cloud computing customers a platform of AMD artificial intelligence chips that will compete with components made by Nvidia, with details to be given at its Build developer conference next week. It will also launch a preview of new Cobalt 100 custom processors at the conference. Microsoft's clusters of Advanced Micro Devices' flagship MI300X AI chips will be sold through its Azure cloud computing service. They will give its customers an alternative to Nvidia's H100 family of powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) which dominate the data center chip market for AI but can be hard to obtain due to high demand. To build AI models or run applications, companies typically must string together - or cluster - multiple GPUs because the data and computation will not fit on a single processor. AMD, which expects $4 billion in AI chip revenue this year, has said the chips are powerful enough to train and run large AI models. As well as Nvidia's top-shelf AI chips, Microsoft's cloud computing unit sells access to its own in-house AI chips called Maia. Separately, the Cobalt 100 processors Microsoft plans to preview next week offer 40% better performance over other processors based on Arm Holdings' technology, the company said.

For example, a company could presumably grow their earnings at 90% (which is a very healthy growth rate), but if Wall Street was expecting triple-digit EPS growth, the stock is likely to fall regardless. In addition, if a company reports earnings above Wall Street expectations but communicates an uncertain or slightly negative future quarter, investors will punish the stock.

How to Boost Your Portfolio with Top Computer and Technology Stocks Set to Beat Earnings,16/5/2024 13:00,Zacks Equity Research16 May 2024 at 6:00 am·2-min read,"Two factors often determine stock prices in the long run: earnings and interest rates. Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter. We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises. 2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist The Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure. The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Nvidia (NVDA) holds a Zacks Rank #1 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $5.68 a share six days away from its upcoming earnings release on May 22, 2024. NVDA has an Earnings ESP figure of 2.9%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $5.68 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.52. NVDA is one of just a large database of Computer and Technology stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Microsoft (MSFT). Microsoft is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on July 23, 2024. MSFT's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $2.90 a share 68 days from its next earnings release. Microsoft's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 0.33% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.89. Because both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, NVDA and MSFT could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/boost-portfolio-top-computer-technology-130004137.html,NVDA
Should NVIDIA (NVDA) be in Your Portfolio Ahead of Q1 Earnings?,16/5/2024 11:57,Anirudha Bhagat16 May 2024 at 4:57 am·6-min read,"NVIDIA Corporation NVDA is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2025 results on May 22. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 20.2%. For the fiscal first quarter, the company expects revenues of $24 billion (+/-2%). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $24.27 billion, which indicates a whopping 237% increase from the year-ago reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings has been revised upward by 3 cents to $5.52 per share over the past seven days. This suggests year-over-year growth of 406% from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of $1.09 per share. NVIDIA has witnessed a remarkable run, showcasing a staggering 91.8% year-to-date surge in its stock price, pushing the company to the forefront of technology and innovation. NVIDIA also achieved a massive milestone in March 2024 by joining the exclusive club of companies with more than $2 trillion market capitalization. The surge reflects investors' confidence in NVIDIA's strategic positioning, robust financial performance and pivotal role in shaping transformative technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), gaming and data center solutions. With the company gearing up to report its first-quarter earnings, let’s evaluate why it is the right time to buy this semiconductor stock. NVIDIA Corporation price-eps-surprise | NVIDIA Corporation Quote In recent quarters, NVIDIA has consistently delivered impressive financial results, surpassing revenue and earnings expectations. In the last reported results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the company’s top and bottom lines increased 265% and 486%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. Its revenue growth has been fueled by robust demand for chips needed for generative AI model development. NVIDIA dominates the market for generative AI chips. The meteoric rise of OpenAI’s ChatGPT and its adoption among enterprises have already proven generative AI technology’s usefulness across multiple industries, including marketing, advertising, customer service, education, content creation, healthcare, automotive, energy & utilities and video game development. The growing demand to modernize the workflow across industries is expected to drive the demand for generative AI applications. The global generative AI market size is anticipated to reach $967.6 billion by 2032, according to a new report by Fortune Business Insights. The market is expected to expand at a CAGR of 39.6% from 2024 to 2032.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-nvda-portfolio-ahead-q1-115700238.html,NVDA

Exciting new products built from generative AI models are just beginning to come to market and will continue to change the way we interact with technology. Just this week there were two significant releases from both Microsoft’s, OpenAI and Alphabet. Additionally, now that broad markets have traded sideways for the better part of two months, energy has been built for a major breakout in the leading names. These product releases should be a valuable catalyst for the next big rally. OpenAI introduced the newest iteration of their primary AI model, GPT-4o. The demonstrations of GPT-4o were extremely impressive, with one video showing the AI model interacting with and tutoring a young boy on his math homework. The GPT, young boy and father were all in conversation with each other, and the GPT helped him through the process in a supportive and logical way. It was really something, and I recommend those interested seek out some of the most recent demonstrations released online. Then, at Google I/O, Alphabet’s annual developer conference, the company introduced its newest AI enabled “Agents,” built throughout its platforms. This product is built on Gemini, Alphabet’s response to OpenAI’s GPT. In one demo, the presenter wanted to return a pair of shoes they bought online. They took a picture of them, and said to the agent, “I want to return these shoes, they don’t fit.” Gemini proceeded to find the order info in Gmail, fill out a return form, and scheduled a pickup from UPS.

"Trending tickers: Chubb, Nvidia, Microsoft, BT and EasyJet",16/5/2024 8:47,"Pedro Goncalves·Finance Reporter, Yahoo Finance UK16 May 2024 at 1:47 am·4-min read","Shares in the Swiss insurer surged in pre-market trading after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) disclosed a major stake in the company. Berkshire revealed it acquired nearly 26 million shares of Chubb in a Wednesday Securities and Exchange Commission filing of the company’s first-quarter investments. That translates to a value of approximately $6.7bn (£5.28bn). Berkshire had requested confidential treatment from the Securities and Exchange Commission in the third and fourth quarter of last year for one or more of its equity holdings. The treatment was sought presumably because Buffett wanted to accumulate Chubb without tipping off other investors and potentially boosting the price of Chubb shares. ""Chubb is an attractive equity investment for Berkshire because it operates in a business Berkshire knows well: property-casualty insurance,"" Cathy Seifert, a CFRA Research analyst who covers Berkshire, said in an email reported by Reuters. The company led by the ‘Oracle of Omaha’ also announced it was eliminating its stake in HP (HPQ). Shares in the chipmaker were higher in pre-market trading after KeyBanc Capital Markets said it sees limited signs of a demand pause for the company. This comes ahead of Nvidia's first-quarter results next week. Consensus expectations on Wall Street are for Nvidia to report revenue of $24.51bn.

Is NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) The Best Jim Cramer Stock to Buy Now?,15/5/2024 21:35,Attiya Zainib15 May 2024 at 2:35 pm·3-min read,"Jim Cramer has been a big believer in NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), recommending the stock almost every week since late 2023. However, amid the recent lackluster performance of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Cramer sounded a bit disappointed, saying the stock now seems to “rally far less than it goes down.” However, Cramer reiterated that he believes NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a stock to own, not trade. Despite concerns around valuation, Wall Street continues to shower positive ratings on NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA). Recently, Wells Fargo’s Aaron Rakers increased his price target for NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) to $1,150 from $970, citing data center strengths. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) bulls believe the company is just getting started since we are in a very early stage of AI adaption phase where companies are testing their AI products.  NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is currently the leader in the AI chips industry with an 84% market share. Don't Miss: 11 Best Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy Now According to Hedge Funds As of the end of the last quarter of 2023, 173 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA). The most significant stake in NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is owned by Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners which owns a $6.8 billion stake in NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA). Patient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter: “This quarter we entered two new positions, while exiting four positions. Our first new position was NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which we bought early in the quarter. Nvidia is the market leader in designing and selling Graphics Processing Units (GPU), which has recently benefited from the insatiable demand of artificial intelligence (AI) models. The company currently captures 92% market share of data center GPUs and grew revenue, earnings and FCF an astounding 126%, 392%, and 610%, respectively, over the last year. While much of the focus is on Nvidia’s market cap reaching $2.3T, up 230% over the last year, the company’s valuation has actually come down over that period. As of 3/31/23, consensus was valuing the company at 61x forward EPS. This compares to today, where the company is being valued at 37x. While yes, we have never seen a company expand their market cap by so much so quickly, we have also never seen a company grow their fundamental earnings and cash generation so quickly (and which is actually expanding faster than valuation). While competitors are working to enter the GPU space, Nvidia has created a moat around their GPUs with their CUDA software offering. While we do expect the large cloud players to continue to move into the market, we think NVDA can continue to demand top market share. With leading edge technology, an increasing innovation cycle and strong cash generation, the company is well positioned for the increased adoption of accelerated computing and artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) was a top performer in the quarter gaining 82.5% in the period. While the company has had an impressive run, gaining 242% over the last year, the valuation has been supported by the impressive growth in Revenue (126%), EPS (392%) and free cash flow (610%) over the last year. The company has solidified its position in the GPU space supported by its proprietary software CUDA. While we expect competition to increase, we think NVDA can continue to maintain top market share. With leading edge technology, an increasing innovation cycle and strong cash generation, the company is well positioned for the increased adoption of artificial intelligence (AI).”  Despite these growth catalysts and AI opportunities, NVDA is not the best Jim Cramer stock to buy now, according to Insider Monkey's research.   Click to see 3 Best Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy That are Better Than Nvidia.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price. The earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 22, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower. While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.

Cherney May 15 (Reuters) - Silicon Valley firm Cerebras Systems on Wednesday said it will supply a supercomputing system to Aleph Alpha, a German technology startup that will use it to develop artificial intelligence for the German Armed Forces. Cerebras has created a computing system that aims to rival Nvidia for training AI systems with huge amounts of data. The company has previously won a deal to supply G42, the government-backed firm in the United Arab Emirates, with AI supercomputers, though those machines will be physically located in the United States. By contrast, the deal with Aleph Alpha, a leading AI firm viewed as among Europe's rivals to U.S. firms such as OpenAI, will involve shipping Cerebras supercomputers to a secure data center in Germany, the first time that a Cerebras system has been installed in Europe. ""The German Armed Forces is a top-tier customer, and Aleph Alpha is one of the AI leaders,"" Cerebras Chief Executive Andrew Feldman told Reuters. ""The competition was fierce."" The two companies did not give a value for the deal but described it as a multi-year agreement in which Cerebras would help Aleph Alpha train generative AI models for the German Armed Forces.

4 Top Stocks to Tap Nasdaq's New All-Time High,15/5/2024 12:50,Ritujay Ghosh15 May 2024 at 5:50 am·4-min read,"The Nasdaq Composite witnessed a robust 2023 and first quarter of 2024. The bull run has also continued into the second quarter despite growing concerns over inflation. On May 14, the tech-heavy Nasdaq ended 0.8% higher to close at a new record high of 16,511.18 points. The index has rallied 10% year to date after jumping 43.4% in 2023 to record its best year since 2020. This year, so far, has been great for Wall Street, with the Dow and the S&P 500 also notching record highs in February. The Nasdaq was a shade slow in catching up but finally hit an all-time high in February. The index has since had a solid run and May particularly has been great. The rally comes despite growing concerns over inflation and rising uncertainty over rate cuts. This year, the Nasdaq’s dream run has primarily been driven by the enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI. While the opinions of experts on the prospects of generative AI vary, significant enthusiasm surrounding the field has been noticed over the past year. Many believe that AI is still at a nascent stage and its full potential is yet to be realized. Once this potential is unlocked, AI is expected to create significant business opportunities for technology companies to produce premium products and, in turn, boost their stocks. Besides, the development of smart devices is contributing to the growth of the AI space, as they require computing and learning capabilities for tasks like face detection, image recognition, and video analytics. These functions require high processing power, speed, memory, low power consumption, and improved graphic processors and solutions, all of which create favorable conditions for the semiconductor industry’s growth. Moreover, while uncertainty over rate cuts raised concerns, the Federal Reserve said earlier this month that any further interest rate hike is unlikely. High-interest rates have a negative impact on growth assets such as technology stocks, and the Federal Reserve’s comments were cheered by investors.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/4-top-stocks-tap-nasdaqs-125000338.html,NVDA

Wallet recovery firms buzz as locked-out crypto investors panic in bitcoin boom,15/5/2024 12:05,Ankika Biswas and Johann M  Cherian15 May 2024 at 5:05 am·4-min read,"By Ankika Biswas and Johann M Cherian May 15 (Reuters) - The recent surge in bitcoin prices has the phones at crypto wallet recovery firms ringing off the hook, as retail investors locked out of their digital vaults make frantic calls to regain access to their accounts. Cryptocurrencies exist on a decentralized digital ledger known as blockchain and investors may opt to access their holdings either through a locally stored software wallet or a hardware wallet, to avoid risks related to owning crypto with an exchange, as in the case of the former FTX. Losing access to a crypto wallet is a well-known problem. Investors forgetting their intricate passwords is a primary reason, but loss of access to two-factor authentication devices, unexpected shutdowns of cryptocurrency exchanges and cyberattacks are also common. Wallet passwords are usually alphanumeric and the wallet provider also offers a set of randomized words, known as ""seed phrases"", for additional security - both these are known only to the user. If investors lose the passwords and phrases, access to their wallets is cut off. With bitcoin prices regaining traction since last October and hitting a record high of $73,803.25 in March, investors seem to be suffering from a classic case of FOMO, or the fear of missing out. Reuters spoke to nearly a dozen retail investors who had lost access to their crypto wallets. Six of them contacted a recovery services firm and managed to regain access to their holdings. ""What would be driving this trend is the fact that bitcoin prices are at $60,000, not $30,000... it's just pure economics,"" said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. ""People who are missing their crypto for one reason or another, or those who don't have access to their crypto, are very much incentivized to get it back."" The world's largest cryptocurrency has surged 161% in the past two quarters, on hopes of a cut in interest rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve and optimism around the launch of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/wallet-recovery-firms-buzz-locked-120525531.html,NVDA

Earnings growth is the highest priority for any start-up or a renowned company. This is because a company won't last long if it doesn’t make money. So, what is earnings growth? Study a company’s revenues over a given period, subtract the production cost, and you have earnings. By the way, this is also considered the most important variable influencing share price. But, expectations of earnings play a noteworthy role. Frequently, we have seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in price following an earnings decline. This is largely the result of a company’s earnings failing to meet market expectations. Earnings estimates embody analysts’ opinions on factors such as sales growth, product demand, competitive industry environment, profit margins, and cost control. Thus, earnings estimates serve as a valuable tool, while making investment decisions. Earnings estimates also help analysts assess the cash flow to determine the fair value of a firm. Thus, investors should look for stocks ready to make a big move. Hence, investors need to buy stocks with historical earnings growth and are seeing a rise in quarterly and annual earnings estimates. The above criteria narrowed the universe of around 7,839 stocks to only 21. Here are the top four stocks that stand out: BellRing Brands manufactures and sells nutrition products.

Cherney (Reuters) - Google parent Alphabet on Tuesday unveiled a product called Trillium in its artificial intelligence data center chip family that it says is nearly five times as fast as its prior version. ""Industry demand for (machine learning) computer has grown by a factor of 1 million in the last six years, roughly increasing 10-fold every year,"" Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said in a briefing call with reporters. ""I think Google was built for this moment, we've been pioneering (AI chips) for more than a decade."" Alphabet's effort to build custom chips for AI data centers represents one of the few viable alternatives to Nvidia's top-of-the-line processors that dominate the market. Together with the software that is closely tied to Google's tensor processing units (TPUs), the chips have allowed the company to take a significant share of the market. Nvidia commands roughly 80% of the AI data center chip market, and the vast majority of the remaining 20% is various versions of Google's TPUs. The company doesn't sell the chip itself, but rents access through its cloud computing platform. The sixth-generation Trillium chip will achieve 4.7 times better computing performance compared with the TPU v5e, according to Google, a chip designed to power the tech that generates text and other media from large models. The Trillium processor is 67% more energy efficient than the v5e. The new chip will be available to its cloud customers in ""late 2024,"" the company said. Google's engineers achieved additional performance gains by increasing the amount of high-bandwidth memory capacity and overall bandwidth. AI models require enormous amounts of advanced memory, which has been a bottleneck to further boosting performance. The company designed the chips to be deployed in pods of 256 chips that can be scaled to hundreds of pods. (Reporting by Max A.

Currently serving as the Chief Investment Officer (CIO) of ARK, she manages nearly $17 billion in assets under management across the ARK Invest family of exchange-traded funds and her distinctive venture capital fund, the ARK Venture Fund.  Although her funds have drawn notice for their innovative strategies, they've also encountered varied outcomes, often likened to rollercoaster rides, with ARK Investment Management witnessing one of its most triumphant years in 2017, achieving a notable 87.4% gain driven by a remarkable 1,300% surge in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. This success coincided with Bitcoin reaching unprecedented highs of $20,000 per coin. On the other hand, Wood's premier investment vehicle, the ARK Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK), experienced a surge of 211% in both March 2020 and January 2021 and managed to retain much of this momentum as the tech sector flourished amidst increased demand for computing products during the latter stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, 2022 presented challenges, characterized by rampant inflation and turmoil on Wall Street from elevated interest rates, leading to the Ark Innovation ETF plummeting by 47% over the year, wiping out all gains accrued during the pandemic era. As of May 10, the ARK Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK) has declined approximately 14.6% year-to-date, contrasting with the S&P 500's 10% gain during the same period. Additionally, Wood has made several predictions about Bitcoin, consistently raising the price target over time. At the beginning of the year, she mentioned that Ark's ""base case"" for Bitcoin would be $600,000. However, this forecast has since been revised upwards to as high as $3.8 million by the year 2030: ""Last year we put out our bull case for Bitcoin. It was $1.5 million. With this institutional green light that the SEC has provided, kicking and screaming though it did, the analysis we've done is that if institutional investors were to allocate a little more than 5% of their portfolios to Bitcoin, as we think they will over time, that alone would add $2.3 million to the projection I just gave you."" However, many are critical of this position. One such individual being Kevin O'Leary. Earlier in January, the ""Shark Tank"" host stated that if Bitcoin were to appreciate to the levels predicted by Cathie Wood, it would signify a collapse of the American economy. While O'Leary acknowledges that many see Bitcoin as a hedge against economic downturns, and he himself holds a portion of it for that reason, with his confidence stemming from Bitcoin's predictable supply, O'Leary doesn't foresee an imminent collapse of the global or U.S. economy, which would be necessary for Bitcoin to meet Wood's ambitious price target. This wasn't the only controversial opinion that the ARK Invest CIO holds. Those keeping up with Cathie Wood over the years might be familiar with her consistently emphasizing innovation, growth, and technological disruption poised to revolutionize human societies. Over recent years, she has heavily invested in genetics, 3D printing, biotechnology, self-driving, and electric cars. However, when it comes to AI, she  appears more cautious, as she alerts investors about valuations in this sector. For the past couple of quarters, Wood has been steadily selling off shares of chipmaker NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), a company many would consider nothing less than the superstar amidst the AI revolution. In an episode of the Wall Street Journal's Take on the Week, Wood gave an idea behind her decisions: We have been selling Nvidia for quite some time, mostly because we believe that for every dollar of AI hardware sold, another $10 of AI software will be sold. Everyone now understands that Nvidia is the key chip player. It's created the AI age in a sense, but we do think that it has become a check the box stock. It's surprising hugely on the high side of expectations, and we do think that expectations could be getting ahead of themselves. Now, I've said this for the past $200, it's closing in on $700 now, but I've watched Nvidia all my career actually since it's gone public, it's a very cyclical stock. The reason is just like now, when Nvidia is feeding a new movement, in 2017, it was the crypto movement, GPUs were very important. There's this hyperactivity, everyone excited trying to get in at the same time, so there's double ordering, triple ordering, quadruple ordering, and then there is an inventory correction. We think that will happen again. Whenever I hear double ordering, triple ordering, quadruple ordering in response to shortages, I do pull away from a stock like that. The first quarter of the year didn't bring much in terms of good news for the Wall Street investor, as Shares in Cathie Wood’s flagship fund tumbled to a five-month low on April 16 following a drop in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), its largest holding, prompted by concerns over the carmaker’s growth prospects amid a round of job cuts. This decline marks a continuation of the challenging period for the $6.7 billion ARK Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK), which has faced losses this year as a number of unprofitable tech companies lose favor with investors and expectations for interest-rate cuts from the Federal Reserve diminish. On the other hand, Cathie Wood's ARK Invest recently offloaded $15 billion worth of 70,600 Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) shares, prompting speculation from investors. Wood clarified that this move wasn't about dumping stock but rather active portfolio management and emphasized that despite the sale, Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) remains a top position in ARK Invest's holdings, reflecting confidence in the company's long-term potential. Wood also mentioned plans to reinvest profits into other promising stocks, highlighting a dynamic investment strategy aimed at maximizing returns.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/15-best-ark-stocks-buy-181816241.html,NVDA
AMD Failed To Meet Lofty Expectations,13/5/2024 18:09,Upwallstreet13 May 2024 at 11:09 am·3-min read,"At the end of April, Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ: AMD) failed to impress, unlike Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) that has been crushing investor expectations on the back of soaring AI chip sales for quite a while. It’s no secret that AMD trails the undoubtable leader Nvidia that holds as much as 80% of the thriving market for AI server semiconductors. For the March quarter, AMD reported revenue rose 2% YoY to $5.47 billion that slightly surpassed LSEG’s estimate of $5.46 billion. Unlike last year’s comparable quarter when it made a net loss of $139 million, or 9 cents per share, AMD reported a net income of $123 million, or 7 cents per share. Adjusted earnings amounted to 62 cents per share, slightly surpassing 61 cents a share analysts expected. Data center revenue jumped 80% to $2.3 billion thanks to AMD's MI300 series of AI processors that challenge Nvidia and its graphics processing units. CEO Lisa Su revealed that AMD’s MI300X is being used by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), and Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL). Since the launch which took place during 2023’s fourth quarter, AMD sold over $1 billion worth of chips. But it was not enough to offset weakness in the traditional server market. Moreover, AMD’s results were also hurt by gaming revenue that tanked as much as 48% to $922 million. AMD already guided significant double-digit percentage declines in this segment due to revenue from the chips it designs for gaming consoles such as Xbox from Microsoft Corporation and PlayStation 5 from Sony Group Corporation (NYSE: SONY) already hitting their peak. This year marks the fifth year since the most recent generation of gaming consoles has been released and AMD's videogame console revenue peaks after roughly four years.Moreover, a report from research firm Newzoo that was published in April revealed that gamers are clocking in less hours. Newzoo expects personal computing and console gaming revenue growth to continue lagging pre-pandemic levels through 2026. Year to date, industry giants like Sony and Electronic Arts have laid off hundreds of employees. Sony Group is scheduled to report its fiscal fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday. All eyes will be on the profitability of the gaming division as PlayStation 5 promotions ate into profits during the third quarter. When it reported its third fiscal quarter results, Sony lowered projections of PlayStation 5 sales and gaming revenue for the rest of the fiscal 2023. Revenue from the embedded segment that consists of networking chips also plummeted 46% to $846 million, with demand for the segment already expected to remain soft throughout the first half of the year. Revenue was additionally hit from ongoing inventory corrections from this segment as clients clear out a build-up of chips. For the full year, AMD expects AI chip sales of about $4 billion, raising its prior estimate by $500 million. As for the second quarter, AMD guided revenue of about $5.70 billion, plus or minus $300 million which is in line with LSEG’s average estimate. On an adjusted basis, AMD guided for second quarter’s gross margin of about 53%, hardly beating the estimate of 52.9%.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/amd-failed-meet-lofty-expectations-180909619.html,NVDA

Cryptocurrency Likely to Resume Rally: 4 Stocks Set to Gain,13/5/2024 12:54,Ritujay Ghosh13 May 2024 at 5:54 am·4-min read,"The cryptocurrency rally in the first quarter that saw Bitcoin (BTC) hitting a new all-time high, has suddenly come to a halt. Bitcoin, which hit a record high of $73,750 on Mar 14, has declined sharply since then. In April, Bitcoin declined 3.9%, after gaining more than 67% in the first quarter. The decline can be attributed to a number of factors, most importantly the just-concluded halving event, which happens once in four years. Also, markets remained volatile in April as rising inflation reignited fears that the Federal Reserve could keep interest rates higher for a longer period. High-interest rates have a negative impact on growth assets such as technology stocks, consumer discretionary stocks, and cryptocurrencies. However, with the Bitcoin halving event now over, there is widespread speculation that the reduction in the supply of Bitcoins will lead to a scarcity-driven price surge for the digital asset in the coming months. Miners, who play a crucial role in validating and recording transactions, receive rewards from the Bitcoin network in the form of both block rewards and transaction fees. The halving event reduces the block reward by half, ultimately aiming to limit Bitcoin's total supply to 21 million coins. As a result, the decrease in the rate of new Bitcoin issuance typically leads to increased demand for the cryptocurrency, which in turn tends to drive up its price. Needless to say, Bitcoin still has a lot of potential. Experts believe the correction is over and the cryptocurrency will soon resume its rally. Year to date, Bitcoin has rallied 39.3%. Also, markets have been trying to bounce back in May, following a sharp decline in U.S. GDP, and a contraction in manufacturing and services PMI, which has raised hopes of multiple rate cuts this year. We have narrowed our search to four crypto-oriented stocks that have strong potential for 2024. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. NVIDIA Corporation NVDA is a major player in the semiconductor industry and has been one of the standout success stories of 2023. As a leading designer of graphic processing units (GPUs), the value of the NVDA stock tends to surge in a thriving crypto market. This is primarily due to the crucial role that GPUs play in data centers, artificial intelligence and the mining or production of cryptocurrencies. NVIDIA’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 84.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 3.1% over the last 60 days. Currently, NVIDIA has a Zacks Rank #2. Coinbase Global, Inc. COIN offers financial infrastructure and technology to support the global cryptocurrency economy.

Utility stocks are on fire — here are Wall Street analysts' top picks,12/5/2024 15:38,Ines Ferré·Senior Business Reporter12 May 2024 at 8:38 am·5-min read,"Utility stocks have turned into leaders recently, gaining more than 4% over the past five days to close out their best week of the year. The S&P 500 Utilities ETF (XLU) is up more than 12% year to date in a reversal from last year when investors soured on the sector due to expensive projects and high interest rates. The prospects of lower rates later this year and increased long-term demand for electricity from artificial intelligence has made the defensive part of the market look attractive, according to Wall Street analysts. ""The excitement surrounding AI has left many investors searching for the next big thing after meteoric rallies in names like Nvidia (NVDA) and Super Micro Computer (SMCI),"" said Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for LPL Financial, in a recent note. Energy consumption is expected to dramatically increase amid a boom in data center growth. Additionally, a re-shoring of manufacturing, which requires more power for battery plants and chipmaking factories, and the proliferation of charging stations for electric vehicles are expected to drive a surge in energy demand. ""Power demand [in the US] for the first time in 15 years is actually growing,"" Neil Kalton, senior equity analyst at Wells Fargo, told Yahoo Finance. Constellation Energy (CEG) Constellation Energy is the largest owner of nuclear plants in the US. The Baltimore-based company has been a beneficiary of the government's push to transition to green energies and growing power demand from data centers. Constellation shares are up more than 85% year to date as the company forecasts base earnings to grow by at least 10% annually through the decade.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/utility-stocks-are-on-fire--here-are-wall-street-analysts-top-picks-153808020.html,NVDA

"With Apple entering the fight, the AI chip wars have gone nuclear",10/5/2024 15:05,Daniel Howley·Technology Editor10 May 2024 at 8:05 am·4-min read,"The artificial intelligence (AI) chip wars have officially kicked into high gear. On Tuesday, Apple (AAPL) unveiled its latest iPad Pro lineup, complete with the company’s all-new M4 chip. The processor, Apple says, features a 50% faster CPU than the prior generation Pro’s M2 chip, as well as a GPU with four times the performance of its predecessor. But Apple focused most on the M4’s neural engine, the portion of the chip dedicated to running AI applications. According to the company, the neural engine in the M4 is the company’s fastest yet, and it's more powerful than any neural processing unit available on today’s AI PCs. That might all seem like Apple puffing out its chest at the competition, and it is to a degree. But it also shows we’re entering a new era of PC marketing focused on the promise of generative AI applications running directly on our machines, rather than in the cloud. Microsoft (MSFT) is already pushing the category of AI PCs along with Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), Qualcomm (QCOM), and Nvidia (NVDA), and with Apple entering the fray, the battle over which company is the new AI champ has officially begun. The AI PC, or in the case of Apple AI iPad or AI Mac, is meant to be able to run smaller versions of the kinds of large language models that power apps like ChatGPT, Microsoft’s Copilot, and Google’s Gemini. In fact, Google (GOOG, GOOGL) already runs a version of its Gemini model called Gemini Nano on its Pixel smartphones. AI PCs are, generally, PCs that include neural processing units (NPUs), or in Apple’s case, a neural engine. These are essentially portions of a chip dedicated to powering AI applications. Intel’s Core Ultra chips, which it debuted in December, feature their own NPUs, while AMD has been showing off chips with its XDNA AI engine since May 2023. Qualcomm, for its part, has also joined the fight with its Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus chips. All of these chips should end up in Windows PCs on store shelves by the end of the year. Microsoft is already banking on AI PCs being a runaway success, going so far as to introduce a Windows keyboard button dedicated to its AI-powered Copilot software. It’s the first new keyboard button in nearly 30 years. Apple, on the other hand, has been building its neural engine into its chips since it launched its A11 processor in the iPhone X in 2017. The company has regularly touted its neural engine’s capabilities throughout the years, but the debut of the M4 chip marked the first time Apple started throwing out key performance metrics. During its press event unveiling the M4, Apple was sure to point out that it not only has been outfitting its chips with neural processing engines for years but that the M4 is capable of running 38 trillion operations per second (TOPS). TOPS is more or less a measurement of how well a chip can handle AI tasks. Qualcomm, for its part, says that its Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus chips offer 45 TOPS of performance. And according to CNET, Intel and AMD’s chips top out at 34 and 38 TOPS, respectively.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/with-apple-entering-the-fight-the-ai-chip-wars-have-gone-nuclear-150546931.html,NVDA

Continued investments in user acquisition for the credit business, along with expansion into digital banking and insurance services, are anticipated to have driven SeaMoney's profitability in the first quarter.The digital entertainment business of Sea Limited is expected to have benefited from strengthening user engagement and improved gameplay in the to-be-reported quarter.The launch of significant games, such as Garena’s flagship game, Free Fire, in its pipeline, and advancements in AI are anticipated to have enhanced its operational capabilities on the Garena platform.Free Fire achieved more than 100 million peak daily active users in the fourth quarter of 2023 and is expected to continue growing in terms of user base and bookings in the to-be-reported quarter.Growing momentum across its e-commerce business, owing to its synergies with Shopee to improve service quality for buyers, enhance price competitiveness and strengthen the content ecosystem, is expected to have contributed to its growth in Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV).

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to 5 Biggest Publicly Traded AI Companies in the World. On May 8, Stuart Kaiser, Citi's Head of Equity Trading Strategy, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance where he discussed the role of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in shaping the market for artificial intelligence. Kaiser suggests that the company's earnings report may be the biggest event to look forward to right now, especially for equity holders, according to the S&P 500 index. He also highlighted that if the 10-year rate was pinned at 4.75%, equities would not be largely impacted if NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) misses earnings on May 22nd. The interviewer then directs the conversation to discuss the volatility of the stock. The stock went down to $735 and $740 a couple of weeks ago, to which Kaiser emphasized how NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) poses a macro risk to the market, keeping in mind that it is priced for a significant swing of 10%. Companies like Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) went down double digitals, and big tech stocks, now stabilized, also have been down in correlation.

4 Semiconductor Stocks in Focus as Sales Make a Rebound,10/5/2024 12:48,Ritujay Ghosh10 May 2024 at 5:48 am·4-min read,"The semiconductor industry is trying to stage a comeback. Sales are steadily increasing and the picture is far better than it was in 2023. Rebounding demand is driving sales and analysts believe that the industry has a lot of potential left. The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) said on May 7 that global semiconductor sales totaled $137.7 billion during the first quarter of 2024, increasing 15.2% year over year. However, sales fell 5.7% from the fourth quarter of 2023. The SIA said that the decline is temporary and sales are expected to grow at a faster pace in the coming months. According to SIA president and CEO John Neuffer, “First-quarter global semiconductor sales were significantly higher than the total from the first quarter of last year, but sales slipped somewhat on a month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter basis, reflecting normal seasonal trends.” The semiconductor industry had a dream run during the peak of the pandemic as millions worked from home, leading to a surge in demand for communication devices and other gadgets. However, price pressures, owing to high interest rates as the Federal Reserve adopted an aggressive monetary tightening policy to curb sky-high inflation, dried up demand. With inflation showing signs of easing in 2023, demand started rebounding, driving sales. The SIA predicts semiconductor sales to grow double digits for the rest of 2024 as price pressures ease further. Moreover, the continued excitement surrounding artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI, is expected to drive semiconductor sales in the near term. Experts believe that AI holds significant potential, with much yet to be witnessed by the world. This is going to drive demand even further as an increasing number of tech companies are exploring the avenue. Given the promising future, it would be wise to invest in semiconductor stocks like NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, Micron Technology, Inc. MU, NXP Semiconductors NXPI and Texas Instruments TXN, from which investors can gain in the near term. Each of these stocks has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and assures good returns.

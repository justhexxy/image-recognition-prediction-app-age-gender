Possible Bearish Signals With Apple Insiders Disposing Stock,21/7/2024 15:05,editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) 21 July 2024 at 15:05 pm·3-min read,"Over the past year, many Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period. While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.Apple Insider Transactions Over The Last Year Over the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Senior VP, Katherine Adams, for US$23m worth of shares, at about US$189 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$224). When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. This single sale was just 30% of Katherine Adams's stake. Insiders in Apple didn't buy any shares in the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/possible-bearish-signals-apple-insiders-120019065.html?prefer_reader_view=1&prefer_safari=1,AAPL,negative
Microsoft's AI chatbot will 'recall' everything you do on a PC,20/5/2024 21:55,"MATT O'BRIEN, MANUEL VALDESUpdated 20 May 2024 at 2:55 pm·3-min read","REDMOND, Wash. (AP) — Microsoft wants laptop users to get so comfortable with its artificial intelligence chatbot that it will remember everything you're doing on your computer and help figure out what you want to do next. The software giant on Monday revealed a new class of AI-imbued personal computers as it confronts heightened competition from Big Tech rivals in pitching generative AI technology that can compose documents, make images and serve as a lifelike personal assistant at work or home. The announcements ahead of Microsoft's annual Build developer conference centered on fusing its AI assistant, called Copilot, into the Windows operating system for PCs, where Microsoft already has the eyes of millions of consumers. The new features will include Windows Recall, giving the AI assistant what Microsoft describes as “photographic memory” of a person's virtual activity. Microsoft promises to protect users' privacy by giving them the option to filter out what they don't want tracked, and keeping the tracking on the device. It's a step toward machines that “instantly see us, hear, reason about our intent and our surroundings,” said CEO Satya Nadella. “We’re entering this new era where computers not only understand us, but can actually anticipate what we want and our intent,"" Nadella said at an event at the company's headquarters in Redmond, Washington. The conference that starts Tuesday in Seattle follows big AI announcements last week from rival Google, as well as Microsoft's close business partner OpenAI, which built the AI large language models on which Microsoft's Copilot is based. Google rolled out a retooled search engine that periodically puts AI-generated summaries over website links at the top of the results page; while also showing off a still-in-development AI assistant Astra that will be able to “see” and converse about things shown through a smartphone’s camera lens. ChatGPT-maker OpenAI unveiled a new version of its chatbot last week, demonstrating an AI voice assistant with human characteristics that can banter about what someone's wearing and even attempt to assess a person’s emotions. The voice sounded so much like Scarlett Johansson playing an AI character in the sci-fi movie “Her” that OpenAI dropped the voice from its collection Monday. OpenAI also rolled out a new desktop version of ChatGPT designed for Apple's Mac computers.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/microsofts-ai-chatbot-recall-everything-185736872.html,AAPL,positive
Web3 Marketing Needs Some of Apple’s Secret Sauce,20/5/2024 14:23,Tomer Sharoni20 May 2024 at 7:23 am·4-min read,"The launch of Apple’s Vision Pro headset has been perhaps the most controversial in its recent history – certainly, the biggest pivot since the company moved into the telecommunications market with the launch of the iPhone in 2007. Presenting the innovation at the time, then-CEO Steve Jobs claimed that it would “reinvent the phone.” Boy, was he right. Current CEO Tim Cook is betting the magic is still there with the Vision Pro – and he’s making many of the same branding and messaging plays that proved so successful for his predecessor, even while the apps, as use cases that prove the technology, are still in their earliest stages of development. This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's Web3 Marketing Week. Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates. Apple Vision Pro is a headset, but you won’t find that word on the product’s landing page. Neither does Apple doesn’t overly concern itself with terms like augmented reality, extended reality, or mixed reality, even though those technologies are the essence of what the Vision Pro does. Instead, Apple chooses to tell you about how the Vision Pro enables you to enjoy immersive entertainment experiences from your sofa, capture and relive your precious moments as 3D photos and collaborate with remote colleagues as seamlessly as if you were in the same room. This is Apple’s secret sauce. It doesn’t tell us why we need the technology – it shows us why we want what it can do. This simple yet impactful communication strategy was instrumental in the widespread adoption of smartphones – and it already seems to be working for the Vision Pro. The device launched to U.S. consumers in February with an initial user base of up to 200,000 based on sales. If that seems underwhelming, then game engine giant Unity announced support for VisionOS from the moment of its release and there are further plans to roll out the device to the tech-hungry Chinese market later this year. Like spatial computing, Web3 is also an umbrella term, liberally thrown together with terms like blockchain, digital assets, DeFi and the rest of the crypto-jargon dictionary. But most people embedded in the crypto sphere have little grasp of how meaningless these words are to the lay person – and it’s not for a want of understanding their implications. Assuredly, the tech is appealing: a global survey carried out by Consensys found that 83% of respondents prioritize data privacy, 70% think they should share in the profits made from their data and 79% desire greater control over their online identities. Thus, the core values of Web3 are a vote-winner with the general public. Yet a disconnect remains: people support the ideology of Web3 without realizing what it is or how they can incorporate it into their lives. At the moment, the industry is an echo chamber with companies preaching to the converted using an esoteric lingua franca that resonates with a small audience of switched-on, tech-savvy users and crypto-native investors. To make good on the promise of Web3, there needs to be a shift towards more accessible, relatable messaging.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/web3-marketing-needs-apple-secret-142336677.html,AAPL,positive

Apple slashes prices of iPhone 15 models to new low in China amid heated competition in world's largest smartphone market,20/5/2024 9:30,South China Morning Post20 May 2024 at 2:30 am·3-min read,"Apple is offering a new range of steep discounts for iPhone 15 models to consumers in mainland China, with online retail platforms bringing prices to a new low amid the US tech giant's efforts to boost sluggish sales in the world's biggest smartphone market. The top-of-the-line 256-gigabyte iPhone 15 Pro Max model, for example, on Monday started selling for 7,949 yuan (US$1,100) on Apple's official online stores on JD.com and Alibaba Group Holding's Tmall platform - down 2,050 yuan, or 20 per cent off, from its 9,999-yuan price tag when the new series was released last September. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post. The basic 128GB iPhone 15 model, meanwhile, now costs 23 per cent less at 4,599 yuan, down from its previous price of 5,999 yuan, on both JD.com and Tmall. The sale runs from May 20 to 28, according to the two platforms. Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

Apple's atypical iPhone discount drive on Chinese online marketplaces started in January, following online and offline campaigns of rival Chinese smartphone vendors - including Xiaomi and Honor - that knocked down prices on their various Android models. Discounts of up to 800 yuan were offered by Apple through its mainland online store in the same month, covering iPhones, iPads, MacBook laptops, AirPods and the Apple Watch.

Apple slashes iPhone prices in China amid fierce Huawei competition,20/5/2024 9:22,Reuters20 May 2024 at 2:22 am·1-min read,"BEIJING (Reuters) — Apple has launched an aggressive discounting campaign on its official Tmall site in China, offering discounts of up to 2,300 yuan ($318) on select iPhone models. The discounting comes as the U.S. tech giant seeks to defend its position in the high-end smartphone market, where it faces increasing competition from local rivals such as Huawei. Running from May 20 to May 28, it is more substantial than the one Apple offered in February. While the highest discount in the February campaign was 1,150 yuan, this time discounts are up to 2,300 yuan. The steepest discount applies to the 1TB iPhone 15 Pro Max model, while other models also see significant price cuts. For instance, the 128 GB version of the base iPhone 15 model has a discount of 1,400 yuan, according to Reuters' checks on Monday. The increased competitive pressure on Apple comes after Huawei last month introduced its new series of high-end smartphones, the Pura 70, following the launch of the Mate 60 last August. Apple's previous discounting effort in February appears to have helped the company mitigate a sales slowdown in China. Apple's shipments in China increased by 12% in March, according to Reuters' calculations based on data from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT). This marks a significant improvement from the first two months of 2024, when the company experienced a 37% slump in sales.

iPad Air M2 review: cheaper iPad Pro for rest of us gets bigger,20/5/2024 6:00,Samuel Gibbs Consumer technology editor19 May 2024 at 11:00 pm·5-min read,"Apple has more options than ever for those after a tablet with different sizes, prices, screens and power, but the iPad Air is fairly simple to understand – it is the premium big-screen iPad for those who don’t want to fork out thousands for an iPad Pro. The Air starts at £599 (€699/$599/A$999) and is now available in two screen sizes: the original 11in and a larger 13in model for big-screen viewing. That puts it right in the middle of Apple’s lineup, with the 10th-gen iPad starting at £349 at the bottom and topped by the new iPad Pro M4 starting at £999. The 11in Air is a straight replacement for the excellent M1 model from 2022, with the same good-looking iPad Pro-like design, the same crisp screen and stereo speakers. The 13in version, as reviewed here, is enlarged by a factor of 1.2 on the diagonal, making it about the same size as previous-generation iPad Pros. The Air’s screen is a significant upgrade on the base-model iPad, being brighter and of higher quality, matching good-quality laptop screens such as those on the MacBook Air or Surface Laptop. But it lacks the more advanced 120Hz miniLED or OLED technology from the iPad Pro line. That means it is not as bright, contrasty or smooth as Apple’s top tablets. Compared side by side, the difference is night and day, but so is the price. The stereo speakers are great for watching TV. The aluminium body and glass front feel solid and are only 1mm thicker than the super slender, 5.1mm thick iPad Pro. The webcam has been moved to the top edge in landscape, which makes for a much-improved video call experience over previous iPads.

The 'Magnificent 7' term needs to be retired after Q1 earnings: Goldman Sachs,18/5/2024 5:39,Investing.com17 May 2024 at 10:39 pm·1-min read,"Goldman Sachs has observed a significant shift among the top technology companies, often dubbed the ""Magnificent 7,"" following their first-quarter results. Collectively, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)., Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc., Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)., Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. saw their profits increase by 48% year-over-year. This growth was supported by a 14% increase in sales and a margin expansion of 521 basis points, bringing the aggregate margin to 22.8%. However, this overall performance conceals the varying fortunes of the individual companies, the analysis showed. Meta Platforms, Alphabet, and Amazon outperformed expectations with sales growth of 27%, 15%, and 13% respectively, leading to year-to-date share price increases of 34%, 25%, and 21%. These gains reflect a stronger market performance for these companies relative to some of their peers. In stark contrast, Apple's sales saw a 4% decline, while Tesla experienced a 9% drop in revenues. Consequently, their stock prices have been impacted, with Apple's shares dipping by 1% and Tesla's plummeting by 30%. This downturn has led to Tesla's ranking falling to the 12th largest stock in the S&P 500 index. ""The sobriquet “Magnificent 7” needs to be retired following 1Q results,"" Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note.

"Apple’s iPad Pro is its most incredible product, but software holds it back",17/5/2024 19:59,Daniel Howley·Technology EditorUpdated 17 May 2024 at 12:59 pm·4-min read,"Apple’s (AAPL) latest 13-inch iPad Pro is a marvel of engineering. But software still hamstrings the iPad Pro’s true potential, relegating the device to a sleek, high-end package for consuming content rather than allowing the iPad Pro to realize its productivity potential. The company has packed its latest M4 processor with up to 10 CPU and 10 GPU cores, more than you’ll find in its current MacBook Air and at least one version of its MacBook Pro, into a tablet thinner than Apple’s iPod Nano. At just 5.1 millimeters thick, the iPad Pro feels like if you hold it by one end, the other will droop like a piece of loose-leaf paper. It doesn’t, of course. The 11-inch iPad Pro is almost as thin at 5.3 mm. Oh, and then there’s the new Ultra Retina XDR display. Apple says the screen combines two OLED panels to boost its overall brightness while offering the same exceptional benefits you’d get out of a normal OLED display. That means inky blacks and brilliant colors. And all of that is going to cost you. A base 13-inch iPad Pro with Apple’s Magic Keyboard will set you back $1,648. That’s more than a high-end 13-inch MacBook Air and an entry-level MacBook Pro. I could deal with that price, though, if the iPad Pro didn’t have one big setback — iPadOS. Over the years, the iPad has made progress toward offering more Mac-like capabilities. You can run multiple apps at the same time, connect to an external display for a larger workspace, group apps together, and more.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,17/5/2024 13:00,Zacks Equity Research17 May 2024 at 6:00 am·5-min read,"Apple (AAPL) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term. Over the past month, shares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned +13.7%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry, which Apple falls in, has gained 12.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction? Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision. Revisions to Earnings Estimates Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock. We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. Apple is expected to post earnings of $1.33 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.4%. The consensus earnings estimate of $6.57 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +7.2%. This estimate has changed +0.5% over the last 30 days. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.20 indicates a change of +9.6% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.4%. Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Apple is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-inc-aapl-attracting-investor-130016542.html,AAPL,positive

Ives reiterated a Buy rating on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock with a $250 price target. Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) list of risks is long. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has faced consecutive quarters of revenue declines as its iPhone business, Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) bread and butter so far, continues to face growth challenges amid rising competition in China and customers' lack of enthusiasm to buy new iPhones. Major stakeholders like Warren Buffett are also starting to cut their stakes in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). To turn things around when it comes to the stock price, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) recently announced a historic a $110 billion stock buyback program. But that didn’t move the needle much for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is trading at around 29 times earnings. Estimates suggest Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) expects to make $6.53 a share in FY2024 on about $385.8 billion in sales, while EPS in fiscal 2025 is expected to come in at $7.13. When compared to peers like Microsoft, which are growing at a much faster rate and have their AI roadmap all in place, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock looks overvalued according to many analysts. Unless Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) pulls a miracle or out-of-this-world innovation, iPhone demand isn’t expected to rebound anytime soon due to a plethora of competitors which are making cheaper but quality smartphones, and rising inflation which is hurting consumer buying power. KeyBanc Capital Markets recently said in a report that iPhone demand in April was also ""soft."" Insider Monkey's database shows that 131 out of 933 elite money managers had stakes in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), down from 134 funds in the prior quarter. The London Company Large Cap Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter: “Reduced: Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) – Reduction reflects strong performance in 2023 and resulting elevated valuation. We believe the outlook for AAPL remains strong with slow growth in iPhone (now #1 global market share) and faster growth in the higher margin services business. R&D will continue to drive new products and AAPL now has over 2 billion installed devices around the world. While near term earnings expectations appear reasonable, we felt it was prudent to reduce the position size based on risks to valuation.”",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-aapl-stanley-druckenmiller-best-122217179.html,AAPL,positive

"Some of the most talented, high-ranking workers at Apple, Microsoft, and SpaceX jumped ship after return-to-office mandates, new study reveals",16/5/2024 16:02,Jane Thier16 May 2024 at 9:02 am·7-min read,"The focus of return-to-office discussions have long focused on the individuals. Why might workers prefer to stay home? Which age groups are most amenable to in-person work, and which are most combative? Does office collaboration make the most sense for creative types or heads-down numbers people? Can workers really be productive left to their own devices? Yet the lingering question of how widespread remote work shapes company outcomes, as well as the wider sector landscape, largely remains unanswered because the whole experiment remains in flux. But a new working paper from researchers at the University of Michigan and University of Chicago, titled “Return to Office and the Tenure Distribution,” comes fairly close to positing an answer: Return-to-office (RTO) mandates, when they’re not wanted, are bad news for companies looking to keep their talent. The researchers matched 260 million resumes to company data to analyze causal effects of RTO mandates on employees’ tenure at Microsoft, SpaceX, and Apple. In scientific terms, they found “a reduction in counterfactual tenure that increases for employees with longer tenure.” In layman’s terms: When the firms enacted RTO mandates, senior employees headed for the door—often to direct competitors—who let them work from home. The number of top-brass employees at Microsoft—as a share of the company headcount—dropped by over 5% post-mandate; at Apple, it was 4%. (Microsoft mandated 50% of the week in-office; Apple, just one day a week.) SpaceX was the worst of the bunch, with a 15% drop, which the researchers chalk up to its uniquely stringent requirement: Five days a week in-person. That human outflow poses an enduring threat to “productivity, innovation, and competitiveness”—the component parts that separate a thriving company from one in freefall. Microsoft’s internal data doesn’t align with the paper’s findings, Amy Coleman, its vice president of human resources and corporate functions, told Fortune via email. The term “return to office mandate” is also inaccurate, she said, adding that Microsoft is a hybrid workplace “that revolves around flexibility and a mix of workstyles across worksite, work location and work hours.” In 2022, Microsoft’s chief human resources officer Kathleen Hogan told Fortune the company considers “working from home up to 50% of the time as standard.” Representatives for Apple and SpaceX did not respond to Fortune’s request for comment, though an Apple spokesperson told the Washington Post that the study drew “inaccurate conclusions” and “does not reflect the realities” of Apple’s business or attrition rates. The statistical analysis came from People Data Labs resumé data, David Van Dijcke, a coauthor and University of Michigan economics PhD student, tells Fortune. “The takeaway is definitely that the effects [of RTO mandates] are more deleterious than people thought before.” Granted, the study is far from all-encompassing; it only studied three major firms, and they were all “early movers” in the RTO push, Van Dijcke acknowledges, pointing to each of their 2022 mandate announcements. That meant senior employees who left Microsoft, Apple, and SpaceX had “pretty good outside options,” namely competing companies that offered remote work with far fewer strings attached. “If we think of Covid as ending in 2022, that was certainly followed by an influx of people claiming they would leave—and then really leaving when the first return-to-office mandates happened,” Anthony Nyberg, a management professor at the University of South Carolina’s Darla Moore School of Business, tells Fortune. “Apple and Microsoft really agonized over how to change their policies—Amazon, too, made many public comments.” To be sure, Nyberg went on, mandating an office return is a major strategic decision—and even in the Michigan study, which found a statistically significant portion of high-earning workers leaving, it remains unclear whether that’s necessarily a bad thing for their former companies. “A big part of this is likely to become a sorting effect in terms of talent finding their best-fit organizations,” Nyberg says. “And people going to competing companies has been a truism for all of eternity.”",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/most-talented-high-ranking-workers-160212454.html,AAPL,positive
"Warren Buffett's Berkshire Confirms Apple Sale, Dumps This PC Maker, Finally Reveals Mystery Stock: Here Are The Portfolio Changes To Know",16/5/2024 15:54,Shanthi Rexaline16 May 2024 at 8:54 am·3-min read,"Investment guru Warren Buffett confirmed Wednesday the trimming of his Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stake and finally shed light on the mystery stock his firm, Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. (NYSE:BRK) (NYSE:BRK), accumulated ahead of the first quarter. Apple, Chevron Trimmed: Berkshire reduced its Apple position by a little over 116 million. The firm now owns 789,368,450 Apple shares valued at $135.36 billion, a 13F filing shows. This is the second straight quarter that the Buffett-led company has diluted its Apple stake. The iPhone manufacturer remains Berkshire’s top holding. Earlier this month, Buffett — at the annual Berkshire shareholder meeting — said the dilution has to do with footing the tax bill and the desire to hold more cash due to economic uncertainties. After adding 15.9 million Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX) shares in the fourth quarter, the firm sold 3.1 million shares of the oil giant in the first quarter. The latest 13F showed Berkshire owning 112.98 million shares worth $305.70 million. But Berkshire added 4.32 million shares of  Occidental Petroleum Corp. (NYSE:OXY), with its latest stake amounting to 248.02 million.

Apple’s disastrous iPad ad mocked by rival Samsung in new 43-second spot: ‘We would never crush creativity’,16/5/2024 14:48,Christiaan Hetzner16 May 2024 at 7:48 am·2-min read,"Samsung gleefully joined this month’s Apple pile-on, unveiling a new ad for a Galaxy tablet that mocks its rival for a rare marketing misstep. The 43-second spot released on social media shows a young woman navigating through assorted debris strewn on the floor before stopping at a broken guitar she picks up. Studying sheet music displayed on her Galaxy Tab S9, she begins strumming a few chords, not caring that the damaged instrument is out of tune. “Creativity cannot be crushed,” ran the Samsung ad in a clear dig at its competitor in Cupertino still reeling from a badly conceived advertisement. We would never crush creativity. #UnCrush pic.twitter.com/qvlUqbRlnE — Samsung Mobile US (@SamsungMobileUS) May 15, 2024 In a world where machines could soon prove superior to their creators, Apple thought the best metaphor when selling its first new iPad Pro in nearly two years was a giant hydraulic press figuratively and literally crushing creative tools humanity has relied on for centuries into one ultra-thin Apple tablet—all to a cheerful Sonny and Cher melody. “Just think of all the things it’ll be used to create,” posted a giddy Tim Cook, only to be inundated with 19,000 replies of overwhelmingly angry consumers. People like actor Hugh Grant came away from viewing the ad disgusted at what was viewed as a vulgar and obscene display of Silicon Valley techno-fetishism personally endorsed by Steve Jobs' anointed successor as CEO, Tim Cook. “Steve wouldn’t have shipped that ad,” wrote Paul Graham, who founded startup accelerator Y Combinator. “It would have pained him too much to watch.”",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-disastrous-ipad-ad-mocked-144834332.html,AAPL,positive
"Google, Apple, and Microsoft make their products friendlier to users with disabilities",16/5/2024 14:47,David Meyer16 May 2024 at 7:47 am·3-min read,"It’s Global Accessibility Awareness Day today, and Big Tech firms have accordingly issued a flurry of announcements about how they’ll make their products friendlier to people whose use of devices is hindered by disabilities. Most coverage of Google’s I/O developer event this week may have focused on its generative AI news, but the company also announced an expansion of Project Gameface to the Android platform. Google announced that project last year—it’s an open-source, hands-free gaming “mouse” that uses the webcam to capture the gamer’s head movements and facial gestures, translating them into cursor movements via the magic of machine learning. Now Google is open-sourcing more of the code so developers can make better Android accessibility apps. Gaming may have been the inspiration for Project Gameface—specifically, the needs of a gaming streamer named Lance Carr, who has muscular dystrophy—but the applications clearly go far beyond, with Google promising use cases in educational and work settings too. In a similar vein, Apple yesterday also announced an upcoming iPhone and iPad feature called Eye Tracking. This does what the name suggests, giving users a way to navigate through and activate the elements of an app, just by letting the front-facing camera track their eye movements. Apple also revealed other accessibility features that will be coming soon: Music Haptics, which will help deaf or hard-of-hearing iPhone users experience music with the aid of “taps, textures, and refined vibrations”; Vocal Shortcuts, which will let users trigger complex tasks by uttering simple sounds; and a bunch of new accessibility features specific to the CarPlay and visionOS environments. Meanwhile, on the intriguing-hardware front, we have Microsoft’s announcement yesterday of the Proteus controller for Xbox and PC gamers. Designed by peripherals startup ByoWave, the Proteus is a kit comprising “snap and play” parts that let people customize a wireless controller according to their needs. There’s a “mother cube” that serves as the controller’s brain, a cube features the directional pad, a piece with a mini control stick, another two providing left and right triggers, and so on. There are many possible configurations, from traditional controller layouts to wand-like columns and tabletop-friendly rectangles. Preorders are open now, with the kit ($255 to first-comers, $299 thereafter) shipping in the fall. Microsoft also used the occasion of Global Accessibility Awareness Day to promise fixes for what some gamers with disabilities experienced from a major change that the company made last November when it started blocking the use of unauthorized accessories with the Xbox console. This has been an issue for those who had put together custom controller setups to fit their unique requirements, with equipment coming from small specialist manufacturers that aren’t official Microsoft licensees. Part of Microsoft’s solution is for those manufacturers to get in touch and make their controllers official, but the company is also updating its own Adaptive Controller, which the Xbox always accepts, to expand support for more accessories. The $99 Adaptive Controller is a clever piece of gear that includes some built-in controller functionality of its own, but more importantly acts as a hub for specialized equipment, such as switches that are controlled by biting, sipping, and puffing with the mouth, or with one's feet. “We appreciate and acknowledge that gaming with a disability is highly individualistic, and the solution for one may not be the solution for all,” the company said.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/google-apple-microsoft-products-friendlier-144738151.html,AAPL,positive
Warren Buffett’s Top Favorite Stocks for 2024,16/5/2024 12:55,Fahad Saleem16 May 2024 at 5:55 am·7-min read,"Warren Buffett's Q1'2024 stock holdings data is out and the market is inundated with excitement around the Oracle of Omaha's favorite stock picks. But unlike many other hedge funds which are fickle and revisit their investments regularly, Buffett believes in buying stocks and then holding on to them for decades. But over the past several months the market remained guessing the name of the ""mystery stock"" in Warren Buffett's portfolio he hadn’t revealed. Berkshire had requested SEC for confidentiality as it was busy buying large stakes in the company. Some said it would be Alphabet, some speculated it would be a Chinese stock (Alibaba was the favorite candidate). But many wise investors said the would be from the insurance and finance industry as Buffett has time and again indicated his preference for companies that are doing what he knows the best: insurance, banks, finance. Finally, Berkshire has revealed this mystery stock pick and it's part of our detailed list of Top 7 Favorite Stocks of Warren Buffett for 2024. At the latest annual meeting of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett revealed that is firm's cash piles had swelled to about $189 billion at the end of the first quarter, with him expecting the kitty to hit $200 billion by the end of the second quarter of 2024. This begs the question: why isn’t Buffett deploying this cash? After all he was the one who once said: “Today people who hold cash equivalents feel comfortable. They shouldn't. They have opted for a terrible long-term asset, one that pays virtually nothing and is certain to depreciate in value."" Buffett's reasoning is simple: he only invests when he finds attractive deals with ""eye-popping"" returns, and the market today just isn’t presenting him with any worthy opportunities. In his 2023 investor letter, Buffett went as far as to say that he sees ""no possibility of eye-popping performance"" in the current environment. Buffett always sticks to his core investing principle: never invest in overvalued equities. In his latest investor letter he reiterated that for him to invest in companies, they have to be ""attractively priced."" The Size Factor Another reason Berkshire isn’t deploying cash is its size and Buffett's inclination towards investing only for significant gains. ""Those days are long behind us; size did us in, though increased competition for purchases was also a factor. Berkshire now has – by far – the largest GAAP net worth recorded by any American business.""",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-top-favorite-stocks-125516289.html,AAPL,positive

Note: The following is an excerpt from this week’s Earnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>> Here are the key points: What we saw in the Q1 earnings season is a resilient and steadily improving profitability picture, both in terms of the growth rate as well as the evolving revisions trend. Positive revenue surprises were a bit less commonplace relative to other recent periods, but margins expanded at a better-than-expected rate. Total earnings for the 461 S&P 500 members that have reported Q1 results are up +4.8% from the same period last year on +4.1% higher revenues, with 77.4% beating EPS estimates and 59.7% beating revenue estimates. The earnings and revenue growth pace for these 461 index members represents a modest acceleration from what we had seen in other recent periods. The +4.8% Q1 earnings growth pace improves to +11.4% once the Energy sector and Bristol Myers’s one-time charge are accounted for. For 2024 Q2, S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +9.1% from the same period last year on +4.5% higher revenues. Estimates have been increasing since the start of April, with the current +9.1% earnings growth pace up from +8.7% on April 3rd. In recent weeks, we have consistently flagged signs of improvement in the overall revisions trend, with estimates starting to go modestly up. We are seeing this trend for the current period (2024 Q2) as well as for full-year 2024 estimates. We started seeing this favorable turn in the revisions trend roughly around when the Q1 earnings reports started coming out. That said, several sectors, including Tech and Retail, had already been enjoying positive estimate revisions for quite some time. At present, half of the 16 Zacks sectors have higher aggregate earnings estimates than expected at the start of the year. We have recently highlighted the favorable revisions trend for the Energy sector in this space.

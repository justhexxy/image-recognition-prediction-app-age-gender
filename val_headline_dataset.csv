On May 8, Stuart Kaiser, Citi's Head of Equity Trading Strategy, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance where he discussed the role of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in shaping the market for artificial intelligence. Kaiser suggests that the company's earnings report may be the biggest event to look forward to right now, especially for equity holders, according to the S&P 500 index. He also highlighted that if the 10-year rate was pinned at 4.75%, equities would not be largely impacted if NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) misses earnings on May 22nd. The interviewer then directs the conversation to discuss the volatility of the stock. The stock went down to $735 and $740 a couple of weeks ago, to which Kaiser emphasized how NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) poses a macro risk to the market, keeping in mind that it is priced for a significant swing of 10%. Companies like Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) went down double digitals, and big tech stocks, now stabilized, also have been down in correlation. To put NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) position into perspective, the company's earnings report and the way big and small tech companies react to it are extremely crucial to the AI space at the moment. The interviewer then questions how megacap tech stocks upheld their leadership position in the market. The interviewer highlights that the NASDAQ 100 hit a high in July last year and mid-January this year, and has been sideways since, relative to the S&P 500 index. Kaiser highlights the magnificent seven including, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA),  held 70% of the market cap last year, however, now they position in the 40% to 50% range, with names like Meta and Tesla not performing as well. He also suggested that the best-case scenario would be NVIDIA missing due to high demand and low supply, indicating that the market is still in high demand. He closed the interview by highlighting that if the industry is to keep progressing, NVIDIA is to keep working harder. You can also take a look at the best AI stocks that will skyrocket.

Wall Street Bulls Look Optimistic About Alphabet (GOOG): Should You Buy?,"When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important? Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Alphabet Inc. (GOOG). Alphabet currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.34, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 44 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.34 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy. Of the 44 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 35 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 79.6% and 6.8% of all recommendations. Brokerage Recommendation Trends for GOOG Check price target & stock forecast for Alphabet here>>>The ABR suggests buying Alphabet, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation. Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation. In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement. Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision. Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR"
"Google rolls out AI-generated, summarized search results in US","Google will use artificial intelligence to return summarized responses to search engine queries from US users as it continues to infuse generative AI into its most widely used products. The company has been testing “AI overviews” that appear at the tops of search results, summaries created by its Gemini AI model that appear alongside the traditional link-based search results. Related: Google restricts AI chatbot Gemini from answering questions on 2024 elections The featured has also been tested in the UK but will be rolled out across the US beginning on Tuesday, Google announced at its annual I/O developer conference Tuesday in California. Google Search head Liz Reid said AI Overviews would become available to “more than a billion people” by the end of the year. Google also announced a text-to-video artificial intelligence model called Veo, allowing for the creation of computer-generated footage based only on written prompts. The model is a clear rival to OpenAI’s Sora, which performs similar functions and is planned to be released to the public later this year. Google additionally revealed a new AI assistant in progress under the working name Project Astra, previewing an early version of the voice tool that can use a smartphone’s camera to verbally identify locations, read and explain computer code and create alliterative sentences. The assistant was previewed to journalists in a video demo and showed the tool interacting by voice with a Google employee, using the camera lens to identify the view from a window – the London area of King’s Cross, where Google’s AI unit is based – and comprehend computer code. Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google, said the tool was “pretty magical”, with Google aiming for its debut in the second half of this year. The company said its overviews feature would be able to handle complex questions such as finding Pilates studios in the US city of Boston, showing their best prices and their walking times from a specific location – all asked in one query. Using Gemini’s technology, Google will start the response with an AI-generated summary, which then links out to other content including web links. The Veo demonstration showed filmmaker and actor Donald Glover praising the model as AI generations like a sailboat gliding across the sea played onscreen. “Everybody is gonna be a director,” Glover said. “And everybody should be.” Concerns over AI-generated footage replacing the work of filmmakers and entertainment industry workers has been a major labor rights issue in recent years. Some of the country’s most prominent entertainment unions, such as Sag-Aftra, have gone on strike over issues that include how studios are allowed to use AI. After seeing OpenAI’s Sora earlier this year, filmmaker and studio owner Tyler Perry also announced that he was putting an $800m studio expansion on hold."
Shareholders Are Optimistic That Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) Will Multiply In Value,"What are the early trends we should look for to identify a stock that could multiply in value over the long term? In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. With that in mind, the ROCE of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) looks attractive right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us. For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Meta Platforms, this is the formula: Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities) 0.29 = US$56b ÷ (US$223b - US$28b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024). So, Meta Platforms has an ROCE of 29%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Interactive Media and Services industry average of 6.4%.  View our latest analysis for Meta Platforms  Above you can see how the current ROCE for Meta Platforms compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free analyst report for Meta Platforms . We'd be pretty happy with returns on capital like Meta Platforms. The company has consistently earned 29% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 96% in that time. Returns like this are the envy of most businesses and given it has repeatedly reinvested at these rates, that's even better. If these trends can continue, it wouldn't surprise us if the company became a multi-bagger. In the end, the company has proven it can reinvest it's capital at high rates of returns, which you'll remember is a trait of a multi-bagger. And the stock has done incredibly well with a 159% return over the last five years, so long term investors are no doubt ecstatic with that result. So even though the stock might be more ""expensive"" than it was before, we think the strong fundamentals warrant this stock for further research. Like most companies, Meta Platforms does come with some risks, and we've found 1 warning sign  that you should be aware of."
"Fraud rife on secondhand marketplaces Depop, Preloved, and Shpock","Consumers have been encouraged to be vigilant when shopping online after research showed fraud was rife on secondhand marketplaces, with Depop, Shpock and Preloved named the worst sites, and problems also discovered with industry giants Amazon and eBay. A survey of 1,300 buyers by Which?, the consumer champion, found that 32% had been scammed on a secondhand marketplace in the two years to January. The most common ruse involved consumers receiving incorrect goods or nothing at all, while others were delivered an empty package or counterfeit goods. The survey comes as an international investigation by the Guardian, Die Zeit and Le Monde shines a light on the scale of authorised push payment (APP) fraud, where victims are duped into making online transfers to a fraudster. It revealed how a vast web of fake shops touting designer brands took money and personal details from consumers who received no items. Purchase scams are the most common form of APP fraud. In the first six months of 2023 alone there were 77,000 cases, equivalent to 66% of the total, reported to banks with £41m lost, according to UK Finance figures. Buyers were most likely to be scammed on Depop, the study found, with 57% telling Which? they had experienced a scam on the site. This compares with 53% for Shpock and 51% for Preloved and Nextdoor. The figure for Amazon Marketplace was 35%, while for Gumtree and eBay it was 29%. The number for Facebook and Vinted was 24% and 22%, respectively. Rocio Concha, Which? director of policy and advocacy, said that, while buying secondhand can save money, the survey’s findings were “worrying”. “It’s important that people properly check the seller’s reviews and profile,” she said, adding that marketplaces need to have proper checks in place and ensure that scam profiles are removed quickly. However, fraud is not a one-sided affair. Which? questioned 1,400 sellers and 22% of them reported being scammed over the same two-year period. They were most likely to encounter potential fraudsters on Nextdoor, at 39%, followed by 26% for Preloved and Shpock, and Depop on 23%. The figure sat at about 20% for Amazon Marketplace, Facebook and eBay, while on Gumtree and Vinted it was 16% and 11%, respectively. In response to the report, Depop said it offered protection for buyers and sellers and was investing in new technology. “We strongly encourage consumers who are buying and selling anywhere online never to share personal information with other users, to be very wary about following links to other sites, and to report any suspicious behaviour via in-app reporting systems.” Vinted said that, as customer-to-customer online platforms become more popular, the “risk of these platforms being targeted by scammers also increases”. Its security measures are regularly checked and improved upon and new tools for secure transactions on the platform are always in development, it said. Nextdoor said that it took reports of fraudulent and scam behaviour seriously and prided itself on offering a “safe place” for neighbours to buy, sell and give away items in their local community."

Here are some of the biggest premarket U.S. stock movers today: JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) stock rose 0.7% after the investment bank raised its forecast for net interest income, or the difference between what it makes on loans and pays out on deposits, to $91 billion, excluding markets.

Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) stock climbed 2% after the New York Times reported that Sony (NYSE:SONY) and Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) have signed non-disclosure agreements that will allow them to look at the U.S. media company's books ahead of a potential bid for its assets. Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) stock fell 4.6% after the Chinese EV manufacturer unveiled a forecast for current-quarter revenue and deliveries that were both below expectations. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock rose 0.4% after Reuters reported that the EV manufacturer is taking steps to appease European leasing companies after its repeated retail price cuts devalued their fleets and slow service and expensive repairs alienated corporate customers. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock rose 0.4% after the tech giant said its Google unit will invest a further €1 billion ($1.1 billion) into the expansion of its data centre campus in Finland to drive its artificial intelligence business growth in Europe.

12 Best Marketing Stocks to Buy,"In this article, we discuss the 12 best marketing stocks to buy. To skip the detailed analysis of the industry, go directly to the 5 Best Marketing Stocks to Buy. The advertising and marketing industry is a vital component of the economy and it plays diverse roles in driving growth, nurturing innovation and creativity, and facilitating market efficiency. According to a report by Solomon Partners, the projections indicate that global advertising growth for 2024 is expected to range from 4.6% to 7.2%, nearly doubling the anticipated growth rate of 2% to 5% projected for 2023. Some of the major growth catalysts in the year for marketing and advertising companies are the Paris Olympics and the US elections. According to the report, the highest ad spending year-over-year growth is expected for out-of-home advertising at 7.2%, followed by digital ad spending at 6.3%. On the other hand, print ad spending is expected to decline by 4.6% year-over-year. In recent weeks, companies with digital advertisement segments saw a healthy rise in their ad revenues. Mega-cap tech stocks such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) beat their estimates and experienced a significant rise in their advertisement businesses. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) reported its earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, on April 24, posting an EPS of $4.71, up $0.39 from forecasts. The company’s revenue was up 27% year-over-year at $36.46 billion, ahead of estimates by $240 million. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) reported that the number of ad impressions delivered across its Family of Apps increased by 20%, compared to the previous year and the average price per ad was up 6% year-over-year. Nearly 98% of the company’s revenue comes from advertisements. At its Q1 2024 earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg made the following comments about integrating AI with its ad business: “...once our new AI services reach scale, we have a strong track record of monetizing them effectively. There are several ways to build a massive business here, including scaling business messaging, introducing ads or paid content into AI interactions, and enabling people to pay to use bigger AI models and access more compute. And on top of those, AI is already helping us improve app engagement which naturally leads to seeing more ads, and improving ads directly to deliver more value. So if the technology and products evolve in the way that we hope, each of those will unlock massive amounts of value for people and business for us over time.” Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) posted its earnings for the fiscal first quarter of 2024 on April 25 and reported an EPS of $1.89, exceeding EPS estimates by $0.38. The company's revenue was up 15.4% year-over-year at $80.54 billion. The company’s Google advertising segment reported revenues of $61.66 billion, showing an increase of over 13% year-over-year. Furthermore, YouTube ads generated a revenue of $8.09 billion, compared to $6.693 billion in the first quarter of 2023. Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) CEO, Sundar Pichai made the following comments at the company’s Q1 2024 earnings call: “We remain committed to all of this work. Finally, our monetization path. We have clear paths to AI monetization through ads and cloud, as well as subscriptions. Philip will talk more about new AI features that are helping advertisers, including bringing Gemini models into Performance Max. Our Cloud business continues to grow as we bring the best of Google AI to enterprise customers and organizations around the world. And Google One now has crossed 100 million paid subscribers. And in Q1, we introduced a new AI premium plan with Gemini Advanced. Okay, those are the six points. So now let me turn to quarterly highlights from Cloud and YouTube in a bit more detail. In Cloud, we have announced more than 1,000 new products and features over the past eight months.” While the above-mentioned companies generate most of their revenues from advertising and marketing, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is an e-commerce company. However, its ad revenue experienced the most noteworthy jump. On April 30, the company reported earnings for the fiscal first quarter of 2024. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) reported an EPS of $1.13 and beat EPS expectations by $0.30. The company's revenue surged by 12.5% year-over-year to $143.3 billion and beat Wall Street consensus by $763.92 million. The company’s advertising business brought in a revenue of $11.8 billion, up 24% year-over-year. Here is what Amazon.com, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) CEO, Andy Jassy said about its advertising business at the company’s Q1 2024 earnings call: “The strength in advertising was primarily driven by sponsored products, supported by continued improvements in relevancy and measurement capabilities for advertisers. We still see significant opportunity ahead in our sponsored products as well as areas where we’re just getting started like Prime Video ads. Prime Video ads offers brands value as we can better link the impact of streaming TV advertising to business outcomes like product sales or subscription sign-ups, whether the brands sell on Amazon or not. It’s very early for streaming TV ads but we’re encouraged by the early response. Moving to AWS. Year-over-year revenue growth accelerated to 17.2% in Q1, up from 13.2% in Q4. It’s useful to remember that year-over-year percentages are only relevant relative to the total base from which you start.” On February 28, Barclays highlighted Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) strategic focus on advertising investments and emphasized their significance in light of ongoing antitrust actions in the US and Europe, as well as the evolving landscape influenced by artificial intelligence, as reported by TheFly. The firm believes that the company’s advertising assets could potentially reach a value of $50 billion over time and can challenge Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in the advertisement segment. Barclays estimates the intrinsic worth of Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) advertising segment at $30 billion, largely propelled by platforms like LinkedIn and Bing, and anticipates a potential $20 billion surge in sales through aggressive distribution strategies. Barclays has a Buy rating on Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares with a $475 price target."

"With 62% institutional ownership, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a favorite amongst the big guns","Significantly high institutional ownership implies Amazon.com's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions A total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 46% ownership  Insider ownership in Amazon.com is 11% To get a sense of who is truly in control of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 62% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk). Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Amazon.com, beginning with the chart below.  View our latest analysis for Amazon.com  Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing. We can see that Amazon.com does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Amazon.com's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Amazon.com is not owned by hedge funds. Because actions speak louder than words, we consider it a good sign when insiders own a significant stake in a company. In Amazon.com's case, its Top Key Executive, Jeffrey Bezos, is the largest shareholder, holding 9.0% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.4% and 6.0% of the stock."
"Walmart shuttering health units, including telehealth and 51 clinics","Walmart (WMT) announced it is closing down its health clinics Tuesday. The move will impact 51 locations in five states, as well as relationships with health systems, like the one penned with Florida's Orlando Health in November. In its announcement, Walmart cited a ""challenging reimbursement environment and escalating operating costs"" as contributing to a ""lack of profitability that make the care business unsustainable for us at this time."" The company declined to comment to Yahoo Finance on the business segment's profitability, or lack thereof. And did not have an answer as to what will happen with the newly-built clinic offices. ""We continually assess our business, once we made the decision, we moved quickly and with appropriate speed, which we believe was in the best interest of our associates, patients and communities,"" Walmart said in an emailed response. A spokesperson said the locations would likely close within a 45- to 90-day time frame. Walmart is just the latest in a string of retail healthcare pullbacks. Walgreens (WBA) announced that it will close 160 of its VillageMD clinics and only maintain the busiest sites, just a few years after investing $5.2 billion to acquire a majority stake in the business. And recently, UnitedHealth Group's (UNH) Optum division confirmed it was ending its telehealth services — which it started offering during the pandemic at no out-of-pocket cost to members. Craig Garthwaite, health economist and professor at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, said that Walmart relied too heavily on its retail strategy in the more complex healthcare system. The idea that ""we use our scale to cut costs, deliver lower prices to gain share — that's just not going to work given the cost structure of what they were involved with here,"" Garthwaite said."
The ending of Google's monopoly trial has Silicon Valley on edge,"Google has a lot at stake as a federal judge weighs whether the tech giant’s search empire should be broken up. So does the rest of Silicon Valley. A landmark antitrust case pitting Google (GOOG, GOOGL) against the Justice Department entered its final stage this past week as prosecutors from the federal government and 14 states said in their closing arguments that Google illegally monopolized the online search and search advertising markets. Google's lawyer, John Schmidtlein, pushed back one more time with a claim the company has made from the beginning: ""Google is winning because it’s better,"" he said. A government win would certainly threaten a giant piece of Google’s $237.8 billion profit engine. But the outcome, which will be decided by US District Judge Amit Mehta in the weeks or months to come, also has giant implications for some of the other big names in the tech world. That's because Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) are defending themselves against a series of other federal- and state-led antitrust suits, some of which make similar claims, and because all three stand to lose or gain depending on the outcome. In Apple’s case, US attorneys have alleged the iPhone maker blocked rivals from entering the smartphone market by using a “web of contractual restrictions.” A similar claim was made by the government in Google's case, which hinges on several types of contracts that Google allegedly used to cement its search dominance. ""The broad lessons here are a long way off, but this is clearly a really important time when the very first of these tech cases is going to be decided,"" said University of Washington antitrust professor Douglas Ross. ""I do think they're going to be interested in how narrowly or broadly [the judge] defines the markets here,"" Ross added, ""and if there is any learning in what he writes that might have application elsewhere."""

RPT-Amazon.com may be feeling pressure to join the dividend club,"(Repeats to additional subscribers, no change to content of story) By Lewis Krauskopf NEW YORK, April 30 (Reuters) - E-commerce titan Amazon.com may be under increasing pressure to offer investors a dividend, as it now finds itself one of the few massive U.S. technology and growth companies not making regular payouts to shareholders. Google parent Alphabet last week became the latest of the so-called Magnificent Seven group of market heavyweights to start paying a dividend, after Meta Platforms declared one in February. The announcements were followed by big post-earnings gains in the shares of both companies, though they were far from the only factor. That has left Amazon and Tesla as the only companies in the group that do not pay a dividend. Microsoft's payouts date back some 20 years, while Apple and Nvidia have been paying dividends for over a decade. Amazon will report quarterly results and hold a conference call with analysts after the market closes on Tuesday, in the midst an earnings season that has produced mixed reactions to results by Big Tech companies. “It certainly puts the spotlight on (Amazon) because now they’re really the last one standing in terms of Big Tech not paying a dividend,” said Nicholas Colas, cofounder of DataTrek Research. “Dividends are representations of earnings power. So the fact that the rest of Big Tech has now decided to be able to exhibit earnings power and growth in earnings power with a dividend, that leaves them very much isolated versus the rest of the group,” Colas said. David Katz, chief investment officer of Matrix Asset Advisors, said the dividend decisions by Amazon's peer group could have some influence. ""They could reasonably say, 'OK, the bigger players like Google, like Meta, have instated a dividend, we can do that as well,'"" said Katz, whose firm owns shares of both Alphabet and Amazon."

15 Countries with the Highest Average Salaries in Asia,"In this article, we will look at the 15 countries with the highest average salaries in Asia. We have also discussed the economic development taking place in Asia in 2024. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Countries with the Highest Average Salaries in Asia. According to the Asian Development Bank, Developing Asia is forecasted to grow by 4.9% in 2024 and maintain the same rate in 2025, driven by factors like the end of interest rate hikes and a recovery in goods exports, especially in semiconductor demand. India is leading in the investment-driven growth, positioning itself as a major economic engine in the region. Moreover, inflation in developing Asia is projected to be 3.2% in 2024, slightly decreasing to 3.0% in 2025. Subregionally, South Asia is leading in growth, with forecasts of 6.3% in 2024 and 6.6% in 2025. India's growth is anticipated to remain strong at 7.0% in fiscal year 2024, supported by rising consumption and investment. Bangladesh expects growth driven by garment exports, while Bhutan sees growth due to hydropower investment. Pakistan and Sri Lanka are set to recover from previous contractions, though challenges like inflation persist. Southeast Asia forecasts growth of 4.6% in 2024 and 4.7% in 2025, with Indonesia, Thailand, Viet Nam, the Philippines, and Malaysia driving growth through strong domestic demand and recovering exports. Meanwhile, the Pacific expects a slight decline in 2024 before picking up in 2025, with Papua New Guinea leading growth due to increased mining activity. While the economic development looks promising, it is worth highlighting that in South Asia, job creation has struggled to keep up with the rapid expansion of the working-age population, according to a report by the World Bank. Over the period from 2000 to 2023, employment grew at a rate of 1.7% annually, while the working-age population increased by 1.9% each year. This imbalance led to a situation where the region was only able to generate an average of 10 million jobs annually, despite a working-age population growth of 19 million per year. India, the largest economy in South Asia, has experienced major challenges in job creation despite strong economic growth. The country's employment ratio declined over the same period, except for a partial rebound in 2023. While India's economy is expected to expand at a rate of 6.6% with the potential for even stronger growth, private investment remains weak. Speaking of jobs, finance specialists and information technology specialists are two of the highest paying jobs in Asia. To read more about highest payings jobs, see the Best Remote Jobs That Pay at Least $100 an Hour. Owing to the economic potential of Asia, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is currently involved in several contributions to Asia, particularly in Malaysia, with a landmark investment of $2.2 billion over the next four years. It is Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s largest commitment in its 32-year history in Malaysia and is essentially focused on several key areas such as building digital infrastructure and creating AI skilling opportunities. The investment will also entail building cloud and AI infrastructure in Malaysia, which will not only meet the growing demand for cloud computing services but also enable the country to capitalize on the economic opportunities presented by AI technology. Additionally, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) aims to provide AI skilling opportunities for an additional 200,000 people in Malaysia and hence, contribute to the development of a skilled workforce prepared for the AI era. Furthermore, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is strengthening its partnership with the Government of Malaysia to establish a national AI Centre of Excellence and enhance the country’s cybersecurity capabilities. While Asia has been a hot destination for investments by several multinational companies, it is not immune to global lay offs. For example, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) plans to slash around 50 investment banking jobs in the Asia-Pacific region, with the majority concentrated in Hong Kong and China. These cuts will affect roughly 13% of the regional banking workforce and highlight the severity of the challenges facing the industry."
"Cerebras Systems, Aleph Alpha to supply AI to German military","By Max A. Cherney May 15 (Reuters) - Silicon Valley firm Cerebras Systems on Wednesday said it will supply a supercomputing system to Aleph Alpha, a German technology startup that will use it to develop artificial intelligence for the German Armed Forces. Cerebras has created a computing system that aims to rival Nvidia for training AI systems with huge amounts of data. The company has previously won a deal to supply G42, the government-backed firm in the United Arab Emirates, with AI supercomputers, though those machines will be physically located in the United States. By contrast, the deal with Aleph Alpha, a leading AI firm viewed as among Europe's rivals to U.S. firms such as OpenAI, will involve shipping Cerebras supercomputers to a secure data center in Germany, the first time that a Cerebras system has been installed in Europe. ""The German Armed Forces is a top-tier customer, and Aleph Alpha is one of the AI leaders,"" Cerebras Chief Executive Andrew Feldman told Reuters. ""The competition was fierce."" The two companies did not give a value for the deal but described it as a multi-year agreement in which Cerebras would help Aleph Alpha train generative AI models for the German Armed Forces. ""Like most companies, armed forces are looking for world class AI,"" Feldman said. ""They're looking to train models (for) language, vision (and) multi-data type models.""

UPDATE 1-US lawmakers unveil bill to make it easier to restrict exports of AI models,"(Adds administration input in paragraphs 3-4) WASHINGTON, May 9 (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of lawmakers unveiled a bill late Wednesday that would make it easier for the Biden administration to impose export controls on AI models, in a bid to safeguard the prized U.S. technology against foreign bad actors. The bill, sponsored by House Republicans Michael McCaul and John Molenaar and Democrats Raja Krishnamoorthi and Susan Wild, would also give the Commerce Department express authority to bar Americans from working with foreigners to develop AI systems that pose risks to U.S. national security. The legislation aims to bulletproof any future AI export regulations from legal challenges and was crafted with input from Biden administration officials. It comes as worries mount that U.S. adversaries could use the models, which mine vast amounts of text and images to summarize information and generate content, to wage aggressive cyber attacks or even create potent biological weapons. The Commerce Department and White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the legislation. Reuters reported on Wednesday that the United States is poised to open up a new front in its effort to safeguard U.S. AI from China and Russia with preliminary plans to impose export controls on the most advanced proprietary AI Models. But under existing U.S. law, it is much more difficult for the Commerce Department, which oversees U.S. export policy, to regulate the export of open source AI models, which can be freely downloaded. If approved, the measure would remove roadblocks to regulating the export of open source AI contained in the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and also give the Commerce Department express authority to regulate AI systems. China has been heavily relying on many open source models developed in the West such as Meta Platforms’ “Llama” series. In March, the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence, a high-level research lab, was quoted by Chinese state media as stating that the majority of homegrown Chinese AI models were in fact built using Meta's Llama models and that this posed a key challenge to China's AI development."
16 Biggest Publicly Traded AI Companies in the World,"In this article, we will take a look at the 16 biggest publicly traded AI companies in the world. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to 5 Biggest Publicly Traded AI Companies in the World. On May 8, Stuart Kaiser, Citi's Head of Equity Trading Strategy, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance where he discussed the role of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in shaping the market for artificial intelligence. Kaiser suggests that the company's earnings report may be the biggest event to look forward to right now, especially for equity holders, according to the S&P 500 index. He also highlighted that if the 10-year rate was pinned at 4.75%, equities would not be largely impacted if NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) misses earnings on May 22nd. The interviewer then directs the conversation to discuss the volatility of the stock. The stock went down to $735 and $740 a couple of weeks ago, to which Kaiser emphasized how NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) poses a macro risk to the market, keeping in mind that it is priced for a significant swing of 10%. Companies like Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) went down double digitals, and big tech stocks, now stabilized, also have been down in correlation. To put NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) position into perspective, the company's earnings report and the way big and small tech companies react to it are extremely crucial to the AI space at the moment. The interviewer then questions how megacap tech stocks upheld their leadership position in the market. The interviewer highlights that the NASDAQ 100 hit a high in July last year and mid-January this year, and has been sideways since, relative to the S&P 500 index. Kaiser highlights the magnificent seven including, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA),  held 70% of the market cap last year, however, now they position in the 40% to 50% range, with names like Meta and Tesla not performing as well. He also suggested that the best-case scenario would be NVIDIA missing due to high demand and low supply, indicating that the market is still in high demand. He closed the interview by highlighting that if the industry is to keep progressing, NVIDIA is to keep working harder. You can also take a look at the best AI stocks that will skyrocket.

Apple’s iPad event was an AI teaser for its future,"Apple’s (AAPL) artificial intelligence push has begun. On Tuesday, the company unveiled its latest iPad Pros, which pack an all-new M4 processor. The chip provides the Pro with a number of benefits including a faster CPU and updated graphics processing unit. But it was Apple’s focus on the M4’s AI capabilities that stood out the most. Apple has been putting its neural engine into processors since 2017 and has previously talked up how it helps power a number of iPhone, iPad, and Mac features for some time. But the M4 unveiling was different, serving as an appetizer for the AI features the company will present at its WWDC event in June, when Apple is widely expected to debut a slew of generative AI-powered software features for its various devices. Apple pointed to a number of the M4’s AI bona fides during the keynote, with vice president of platform architecture Tim Millet specifically noting that the chip is capable of 34 trillion operations per second, a measurement commonly used when describing a chip’s AI performance. Millet also said that the M4’s neural engine is more powerful than any neural processing unit in any AI PC. That’s a direct shot at Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), and Qualcomm (QCOM), which are preparing to or are already rolling out their own AI PC chips designed to run large language models on Windows laptops and desktops. Outside of the M4’s AI processing fundamentals, Apple was mum on any substantive discussion of AI software updates. Sure, Millet said that the M4 helps the iPad Pro quickly isolate a subject from its background in a 4K video, but the M2-equipped iPad Air can do the same thing, just a bit slower. All the company had to offer was that the M4 would make AI apps and features run faster and more smoothly. The company also didn’t provide information about the M4’s performance while training or running large language models (LLMs), something that Intel, Qualcomm, and AMD regularly point to as indicators of their chips’ strengths. Still, the fact that Apple gave consumers, and Wall Street, an early look at its AI thinking is important. The company is widely viewed as behind the curve when it comes to the generative AI race, and investors are banking heavily on WWDC serving as Apple’s big AI coming-out party. CEO Tim Cook has been steadily mentioning AI more over the past few months and said during the company’s most recent earnings call that the iPhone maker is investing heavily in the technology."
Employees are secretly bringing their own AI tools to work so they can keep up,"Good morning. For some time, I’ve been speaking with industry experts and CFOs about ways to implement AI in finance and how to determine a business case for generative AI. But there’s new eye-opening information for companies that haven’t yet come up with an AI plan. Microsoft's 2024 Work Trend Index, released on Wednesday in partnership with LinkedIn, finds that, in the last six months, the use of generative AI has nearly doubled, with 75% of global knowledge workers using it. (Knowledge workers are considered professionals in roles like public accountants, engineers, editors, and lawyers.) In addition, 78% of AI users are actually bringing their own AI tools to the workplace, which is coined “BYOAI.” And this action is without guidance or clearance from leadership. But, employees who are trying to keep up with a fast pace and large volumes of work are leaning on the technology. Microsoft and LinkedIn pointed out that BYOAI isn’t just implemented by Gen Z (85%). It cuts across all generations—millennials (78%), Gen X (76%), and boomers (73%). Seventy-nine percent of leaders surveyed agree their company needs to adopt AI to stay competitive. However, 59% worry about quantifying the productivity gains of AI. “While leaders agree AI is a business imperative, many believe their organization lacks a plan and vision to go from individual impact to applying AI to drive the bottom line,” according to the report. “The pressure to show immediate ROI is making leaders inert, even in the face of AI inevitability.” The findings are based on a survey of 31,000 people across 31 countries, identifying labor and hiring trends from LinkedIn, and analyzing Microsoft 365 productivity signals as well as research with Fortune 500 customers. You can read the full report here. Although many knowledge workers are eager to get the ball rolling with AI, some employees are hesitant to use the technology. I recently read an article in Harvard Business Review that speaks to this. It’s titled, “For Success with AI, Bring Everyone On Board” by David De Cremer, a professor of management and technology at Northeastern University. Cremer argues that it’s counterproductive for leaders to avoid involving rank-and-file employees in AI projects. Cremer writes: “If you want to avoid resistance from your employees when introducing AI, you must push them out of their comfort zone while ensuring that they understand why you’re doing so. They should know how you plan to take care of them during this transition. You’ll need to exercise patience because it will take time and effort for workers to become familiar with AI and see how it can help them in their jobs.” He provides suggestions on what organizations must do to develop employee-inclusive AI practices. Moving beyond experimentation with AI to business transformation is tough. But it seems to be a necessity to stay competitive. Have a good weekend. Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.com"
Alphabet (GOOG) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons Why,"Growth stocks are attractive to many investors, as above-average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock. In addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end. However, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects. Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank. Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this company a great growth pick right now. Earnings Growth Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration. While the historical EPS growth rate for Alphabet is 23.4%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 31.8% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 29.6%. Cash Flow Growth"
Google fights $17 billion UK lawsuit over adtech practices,"LONDON (Reuters) - Google parent Alphabet has urged a London tribunal to block a mass lawsuit which accuses it of abusing its dominance in the online advertising market, in the latest case to focus on the search giant's business practices. The lawsuit seeks damages of up to 13.6 billion pounds ($16.9 billion) on behalf of publishers of websites and apps based in the United Kingdom, who say they have suffered losses due to Google's allegedly anticompetitive behaviour. Lawyers for Ad Tech Collective Action asked the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) to certify the case to proceed towards a trial at the start of a three-day hearing on Wednesday. Google, however, said the case was incoherent and did not explain how alleged anticompetitive conduct had supposedly caused losses to the publishers. Ad Tech Collective Action's lawyer Robert O'Donoghue said the London lawsuit was ""the latest in a series of major set-preferencing abuse cases involving Google"". The case comes amid ongoing probes by regulators into Google's adtech business, including by Britain's Competition and Markets Authority and the European Commission, which O'Donoghue said was concluding imminently. O'Donoghue also referred to two multibillion-euro fines levied on Google by the European Commission, over its online shopping search service and the requirement to pre-install Google Search and its Chrome browser on Android mobile devices. Google is also fighting two lawsuits in the U.S., one brought by the Department of Justice and another by Texas and other states, accusing the company of anticompetitive conduct. The company ""strongly rejects the underlying allegations against it"", its lawyers said in court documents for the CAT case. ""Google's impact in the ad tech industry has been hugely procompetitive."" Ad Tech Collective Action's proposed lawsuit is the latest against a tech giant at the CAT, which already this year has certified a $3.8 billion case against Facebook parent Meta and a nearly $1 billion case against Apple."
Google Briefly Lost Ownership Of Its Domain After It Was Mistakenly Sold For $12 To A Former Employee,"Even tech giants make mistakes. In a surprising incident from 2015, Google once briefly lost ownership of its domain, Google.com, as reported by CNN. Sanmay Ved, a former employee, managed to buy the domain late at night while exploring Google’s domain service platform. To his utter shock, Google.com was listed as available, and he purchased it for just $12. Don't Miss: Invest in time-tested solution that aims to solve this $600 billion women’s health problem at 80 cents per share. This Uber-for-moving startup is quietly taking the world by storm, here’s how anyone can invest for a limited time. Ved shared a detailed account of an unexpected incident on LinkedIn, describing how he stumbled upon the availability of ""google.com"" on Google Domains. At 1:20 a.m. Eastern Time, he was exploring the platform when he entered the domain into the search bar and was surprised to find it listed as available. Contrary to usual indications, the option to add the domain to his cart was visible, which is typically not seen unless a domain is genuinely available for sale. Upon clicking the ""add to cart"" icon, the domain was successfully added to his cart, confirmed by a green checkmark. Ved proceeded to checkout, curious to see if the transaction would go through. He recalled, ""I was hoping I would get an error at some time saying the transaction did not go through, but I was able to complete the purchase, and my credit card was actually charged!"" Trending: Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity. He immediately received access to Google Webmaster Tools notifications, confirming his temporary ownership. He provided screenshots of the emails and proof of the charge appearing on his credit card as well. Ved also reported the incident to Google Security. In his post, he mentioned, ""Google has reverted, has acknowledged the incident, and is investigating into the incident."""
"Trending tickers: Chubb, Nvidia, Microsoft, BT and EasyJet","Shares in the Swiss insurer surged in pre-market trading after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) disclosed a major stake in the company. Berkshire revealed it acquired nearly 26 million shares of Chubb in a Wednesday Securities and Exchange Commission filing of the company’s first-quarter investments. That translates to a value of approximately $6.7bn (£5.28bn). Berkshire had requested confidential treatment from the Securities and Exchange Commission in the third and fourth quarter of last year for one or more of its equity holdings. The treatment was sought presumably because Buffett wanted to accumulate Chubb without tipping off other investors and potentially boosting the price of Chubb shares. ""Chubb is an attractive equity investment for Berkshire because it operates in a business Berkshire knows well: property-casualty insurance,"" Cathy Seifert, a CFRA Research analyst who covers Berkshire, said in an email reported by Reuters. The company led by the ‘Oracle of Omaha’ also announced it was eliminating its stake in HP (HPQ). Shares in the chipmaker were higher in pre-market trading after KeyBanc Capital Markets said it sees limited signs of a demand pause for the company. This comes ahead of Nvidia's first-quarter results next week. Consensus expectations on Wall Street are for Nvidia to report revenue of $24.51bn. But to avoid disappointing investors, KeyBanc analyst John Vinh said, the chipmaker will need to report revenue of around $26bn and give guidance for its second quarter of around $28.5bn. Read more: Mag 7 stocks including Apple and Amazon still holding strong “Despite anticipation of next-generation Blackwell GPUs [graphics-processing units] in the second half, we see limited signs of a demand pause and expect Nvidia to report first-quarter results and second-quarter guidance meaningfully above expectations,” wrote Vinh in a research note. The company will post its first-quarter results on May 22. Shares have drifted from a range of $850 to $950 since late March."
4 Blue-Chip Stocks in Focus as Dow Hits New Milestone,"Wall Street has resumed its rally this month after a brief pause in April as investors appear to be confident after a spate of favorable economic data, raising optimism about a rate cut soon. All the three major indexes hit a fresh all-time high last week, with the Dow leading from the front. The Dow gained 0.3% on Friday to close at 40,003.59, clinching a fresh record high. The index crossed 40,000 for the first time on May 16. The Dow has been on a rally since the beginning of the year. The Dow has registered 19 record closing highs in 2024. Year to date, the blue-chip index has gained 7.9% and has now ended in the green for five consecutive weeks. Positive economic data has been responsible for the Dow’s recent rally. The Labor Department reported earlier this month that inflation eased in April after increasing in the first three months of the year. The consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.3% month over month in April, lower than the consensus estimate of a rise of 0.4%. On a year-over-year basis, CPI rose 3.4%, in line with analysts’ expectations. Core CPI, which excludes the volatile food and energy prices, also rose 0.3% sequentially in April after increasing 0.4% in the first three months of the year. Year over year, CPI rose 3.6% in April, the lowest monthly increase since April 2021. Besides, job additions to the economy slowed in April, indicating that the labor market is finally cooling. Also, U.S. GDP grew a meager 1.6% in the first quarter after rising 3.4% in the final quarter of 2023, suggesting a slowdown. A slowdown in the manufacturing and services sector PMI in April further suggested a slowing economy, fueling the rally. Investors are again optimistic that the Federal Reserve will soon start its planned rate cuts. Last month, the central bank said that it’s unlikely that there will be another interest rate hike. Moreover, the Fed still plans three 25-basis-point rate cuts by the end of 2024. Markets are now pricing in a 73.2% chance that the Fed will cut the benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points in September, according to the CME FedWatch tool."
"The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Alphabet, Datadog, Garmin, Salesforce and CrowdStrike","Chicago, IL – May 17, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Alphabet GOOGL, Datadog DDOG, Garmin GRMN, Salesforce CRM and CrowdStrike CRWD. Wall Street witnesses a new big bull as inflation resumes a downward trend. This is evident from the latest Consumer Price Index (“CPI”) report released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which shows that U.S. consumer prices increased less than expected in April 2024. The CPI rose 0.3% over the previous month and 3.4% over the prior year in April. This indicates a deceleration from March 2024, in which CPI grew 3.5%. Economists are of the view that price pressure will be down gradually and, thus, inflation will eventually incline toward the Federal Reserve’s target of 2%. This, in turn, has raised hopes of investors regarding interest rate cuts by the Fed in September 2024. Cooling inflation has pushed the stocks to record highs. The S&P 500 index closed at $5,308.15 on Wednesday, exceeding the mark of $5,300 for the first time. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite surged 1.4%, closing at $16,742.39, whereas the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached the $40,000 milestone, closing at $39,908 yesterday. Investors looking for growth opportunities should consider investing in technology stocks in the current scenario. The likelihood of interest rate cuts bodes well for growth-oriented tech stocks. Lower interest rates are expected to boost cash inflows, especially free cash flows in the future, which remains crucial for growth-seeking tech stocks. Free cash flows help companies in pursuing acquisitions and investments in technical advancements. Lower interest rates will reduce the cost of borrowings of the technology companies, which will likely bolster their growth prospects. In addition, lower inflation will enable enterprises to sign multi-year agreements, which, in turn, will help technology companies win several valuable deals. The growing proliferation of generative AI technology remains a major positive for the technology sector. The ability to interact with humans, respond to questions asked in various languages, generate content, classify data and perform coding on the back of large language models (LLM) are bolstering the adoption of generative AI-backed chatbots. Increasing adoption of Machine Learning, Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality devices, quantum computing and cloud computing have been contributing well to the performances of the technology companies. Growing demand for data centers, driven by the need for increasing cloud capacity to support AI-related workloads, is acting as a tailwind. Apart from his, strong momentum across customer relationship software, employee management tools, natural language processing tools, time tracking tools and cyber security software is highly benefiting the software companies."
"AI Revolution 'On the Doorstep:' The 'Tidal Wave' Is Well Underway, Analyst Says","The recent earnings season has made it abundantly clear that the AI revolution is not just knocking on the door but has forcefully entered the tech world.  The impressive results from tech giants such as Microsoft Corp. (NYSE:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)(NASDAQ:GOOG) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) underscored this transition, according to Daniel Ives, an equity analyst at Wedbush. These companies have reported “eye-popping capital expenditure numbers,” initiating an “AI tidal wave” in software and cloud development driven by generative AI. “The next phase of AI spending is now on the doorstep for the likes of Salesforce Inc. (NYSE:CRM), MongoDB Inc. (NASDAQ:MDB), Oracle Corp. (NYSE:ORCL), ServiceNow Inc. (NYSE:NOW), Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR), Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) and many others,” Ives wrote. The expert said companies were “laser-focused on deploying generative AI” across various sectors. Additionally, major players such as Meta and Apple were diving deep into AI, heralding a consumer AI cycle that promised significant spending in the coming years. Other major players like Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are diving deep into AI, heralding a consumer AI cycle that promises significant spending in the coming years. Ives projected AI and related purchases will account for 8%-10% of IT budgets in 2024, a stark increase from less than 1% in 2023. This surge represented a “massive growth catalyst” in what he referred to as the “initial wave of AI software growth.” Industry-Wide Impact and Consumer Trends Ives highlighted Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft as leaders in this burgeoning field, with their influence paving the way for a trillion-dollar spending spree over the next decade. Recent consumer surveys conducted by Wedbush show “broadly positive” trends for Internet-related groups, with expectations of strong digital advertising growth in 2024."
"AI investments are showing signs of a payoff, but the price is steep","Tech earnings season is in full swing, and while a handful of notable players still need to report, namely Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA), there’s one key throughline running through the announcements so far: It’s taking a lot of money to make money on AI. Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT), four of tech’s biggest AI players, have each called out AI sales growth, though without many specifics, while pointing to increased spending on capital expenditures to meet AI demand. Microsoft announced last week it spent $14 billion on capital expenditures tied to its AI buildout in its fiscal third quarter, up from $7.8 billion in the same period last year. The company’s 2024 capital expenditures have already eclipsed its spending across all of 2023, and there’s still another quarter left in its fiscal year. Google parent Alphabet said it spent $12 billion in the last quarter and will continue at that pace for the rest of the year. Meta similarly said it’s cranking up spending for the full year from $30 billion-$37 billion to $35 billion-$40 billion. And CFO Susan Li said that number will increase in the year ahead as well. And on Tuesday, Amazon said it would blow past last year’s $48.4 billion in capital expenditures, saying the $14 billion it spent in Q1 will be the low for the year. Those are mountains of cash. And while there are early signs that AI is driving revenue growth, it’ll take time before it truly makes an impact on companies’ bottom lines. “I'm thinking it's a 12- to 18-month investment period before we start to see a lot of this really pay off big time,” TECHnalysis founder and chief analyst Bob O’Donnell told Yahoo Finance. Generative AI is still a relatively new technology. Sure, it blew up in 2023, but corporations are slow-moving entities, and many are only starting to try out generative AI applications across their business segments. “If I sign up for Microsoft 365 with Microsoft, do I sign up all of my 100,000 employees or do I sign up 500 to check it out?” O’Donnell asked, adding that companies are starting out with a smaller number of signups to get a sense of how they can best use AI applications on the job before signing up the rest of their employees. That’s not necessarily a bad thing for tech companies. During its earnings call last week, Microsoft said AI accounted for 7 percentage points of revenue growth in its Azure and other cloud services business. That was up from 6 percentage points in the prior quarter and 3 percentage points in the quarter before that. In Q4 last year, the company said AI drove 1 percentage point of growth in Azure."
Google Stares Down Largest Tech Antitrust Ruling In 2 Decades — Is AT&T-Style Breakup Next?,"Closing arguments for the largest antitrust trial to date against Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), also known as Google, wrapped up last week. Now, it's up to Judge Amit Mehta to decide on a ruling that could change the fate of the company and others in the big tech space. Mehta, of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, is expected to come up with a decision before the end of the year. The case was put forth by the Justice Department in 2020, together with attorneys general from 11 states, who are arguing that Google has engaged in anti-competitive practices in order to maintain its dominance in the internet search space. Specifically, they're looking at the billions of dollars Google pays monthly to other tech companies in order to secure its place as the default search engine in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung, LG, Motorola owned by Lenovo Group Ltd (OTC:LNVGY) and other devices as well as in browsers like Mozilla Firefox and Opera. The plaintiffs argue that this practice prevents other companies from succeeding with their own search engine products, giving Google disproportionate market share in the search engine space. Last week, court documents revealed that Google paid Apple $20 billion in 2022 to be the default search engine on Safari, the web browser used on iPhone, iPad and Mac devices. In 2021, the figure amounted to $26.3 billion when including other browsers like Firefox. Google is estimated to account for about 90% of all internet searches, widely outpacing competitors like Microsoft Corp's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Bing, Yahoo Search or DuckDuckGo, a search engine that is privately owned and focused on user privacy. The final arguments from Google's attorneys as well as DOJ lawyer David Dahlquist followed a 10-week trial between September and November 2023. Read also: Google Fights Fortnite Maker’s Play Store Changes Amid Antitrust Battle: What’s at Stake? The case, however, was three years in the making for the Justice Department. The central argument of the lawsuit is that Google’s control of today’s internet is extensive enough to be considered a monopoly, and that it violated antitrust laws by paying competitor firms, cell phone manufacturers, and wireless internet providers to maintain its position as the default search engine."
Amazon CEO Andy Jassy: An ‘embarrassing’ amount of your success in your 20s depends on your attitude,"Gen Z might be on to something when they say having a ""delulu"" mindset—that is, having a perhaps unjustified belief in yourself—is the secret to success. That’s because Amazon’s CEO Andy Jassy just revealed that it’s not a ritzy college degree or being the best networker that will make you stand out at the start of your career—but a positive attitude. “An embarrassing amount of how well you do, particularly in your twenties, has to do with attitude,” Jassy said in an interview with LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky. After giving up on a career in sportscasting and then dabbling in music management, Jassy—who took Amazon’s helm after Jeff Bezos stepped down in 2021—joined the tech giant in 1997 as a marketing manager. The Harvard Business School alumnus went on to launch the cloud computing platform Amazon Web Services with Bezos. By 2020, AWS generated $13.5 billion of Amazon’s $22.9 billion in annual operating income, making him a clear candidate for CEO. Looking back, he told Roslansky that “there's so many things that you can't control in your work life, but you can control your attitude.” “I think people would be surprised how infrequently people have great attitudes,” he said. “I think it makes a big difference.” The reason why Jassy thinks positivity determines success is pretty straight forward: People want to be around positive people. “You pick up advocates and mentors much more quickly,” he added. “People want those people to succeed—and it's very controllable.” But a cheerful disposition alone won’t get you far, Jassy warned—aspirational workers need to follow through on a can do attidude with action. “Do you work hard? Do you do what you said you were going to do?” he asked. It’s easy to assume that once you’ve climbed the ranks, it’s now your turn to impart knowledge onto others. But Jassy warned that your enthusiasm for learning musn’t end in your twenties—or, when you reach management."
Cryptocurrency Likely to Resume Rally: 4 Stocks Set to Gain,"The cryptocurrency rally in the first quarter that saw Bitcoin (BTC) hitting a new all-time high, has suddenly come to a halt. Bitcoin, which hit a record high of $73,750 on Mar 14, has declined sharply since then. In April, Bitcoin declined 3.9%, after gaining more than 67% in the first quarter. The decline can be attributed to a number of factors, most importantly the just-concluded halving event, which happens once in four years. Also, markets remained volatile in April as rising inflation reignited fears that the Federal Reserve could keep interest rates higher for a longer period. High-interest rates have a negative impact on growth assets such as technology stocks, consumer discretionary stocks, and cryptocurrencies. However, with the Bitcoin halving event now over, there is widespread speculation that the reduction in the supply of Bitcoins will lead to a scarcity-driven price surge for the digital asset in the coming months. Miners, who play a crucial role in validating and recording transactions, receive rewards from the Bitcoin network in the form of both block rewards and transaction fees. The halving event reduces the block reward by half, ultimately aiming to limit Bitcoin's total supply to 21 million coins. As a result, the decrease in the rate of new Bitcoin issuance typically leads to increased demand for the cryptocurrency, which in turn tends to drive up its price. Needless to say, Bitcoin still has a lot of potential. Experts believe the correction is over and the cryptocurrency will soon resume its rally. Year to date, Bitcoin has rallied 39.3%. Also, markets have been trying to bounce back in May, following a sharp decline in U.S. GDP, and a contraction in manufacturing and services PMI, which has raised hopes of multiple rate cuts this year. We have narrowed our search to four crypto-oriented stocks that have strong potential for 2024. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. NVIDIA Corporation NVDA is a major player in the semiconductor industry and has been one of the standout success stories of 2023. As a leading designer of graphic processing units (GPUs), the value of the NVDA stock tends to surge in a thriving crypto market. This is primarily due to the crucial role that GPUs play in data centers, artificial intelligence and the mining or production of cryptocurrencies. NVIDIA’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 84.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 3.1% over the last 60 days. Currently, NVIDIA has a Zacks Rank #2. Coinbase Global, Inc. COIN offers financial infrastructure and technology to support the global cryptocurrency economy. COIN provides a main financial account for consumers in the crypto space, a marketplace with liquidity for institutional crypto asset transactions, and technology and services for developers to build crypto-based applications and accept cryptocurrencies securely as payment."

After making huge profits on his NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) stake, which he bought in the fourth quarter of 2022, billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller cut his stake in the AI chips company by 72% in the first quarter of 2024, a move that surprised many. Insider Monkey's data shows that Druckenmiller loaded up on 582,915 NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares during the fourth quarter of 2022 at an average price of $146.65 per share. Near the end of the first quarter of this year, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock was hovering around $902 per share.

UBS earlier this month published a list of stocks that are set to benefit from the massive surge in the AI industry, which the firm believes could touch $400 billion in revenue in the next three years. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) was part of the list. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is continuing to refresh and update its AI chips product line as demand is skyrocketing. Analysts expect NVIDIA Corp's (NASDAQ:NVDA) H200 chips and Spectrum-X platform to offer cutting-edge processing and networking solutions for companies that are making generative AI software and applications.

After all NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) still enjoys an 80% market share in the GPU industry, which its products are expected to see high demand in other industries, like automotive, gaming and mobile devices. NVIDIA Corp's (NASDAQ:NVDA) ""real world"" AI segment is thriving. Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently revealed that his company currently has 35,000 H100 chips. Tesla also plans to become the third-biggest NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) customer as Tesla plans to have 85,000 Nvidia H100 chips by the end of 2024 to train its AI models. However, some circles have voiced concerns on NVIDIA Corp's (NASDAQ:NVDA) valuation following the eye-popping stock price gains NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) has enjoyed over the past few months. This comes as major NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) customers like Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Amazon and Google begin to mull producing AI chips in-house. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is also outsourcing its production to Taiwan Semiconductor, which makes NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) vulnerable to any geopolitical risks especially when President Biden is upping the ante against China with new traffics and hawkish tone.

"Another streaming bundle: Comcast's Peacock to partner with Netflix, Apple TV+","Consumers will soon have access to yet another streaming bundle. Comcast (CMCSA) CEO Brian Roberts said early Tuesday that later this month, the company will launch a new offering that combines its Peacock platform, Netflix (NFLX), and Apple TV+ (AAPL). The new bundle, referred to as StreamSaver, will be available to customers of Comcast’s broadband internet service, the executive revealed at a MoffettNathanson conference. ""Those three products will come at a vastly reduced price to anything in the market today and be available to all our customers,"" Roberts said. Exact pricing details will be announced at a later date. ""We've been bundling video successfully and creatively for 60 years,"" he added. ""This is the latest iteration of that, and I think this will be a pretty compelling package."" The developments come as media companies face pressure from investors to scale their streaming services and achieve profitability. At the same time, the companies are dealing with more competition from tech giants like Amazon (AMZN) and YouTube (GOOGL, GOOG), which are gobbling up streaming deals. On average, US consumers subscribe to four streaming services and spend about $61 per month on them, according to the latest Digital Media Trends report from Deloitte. That means fewer opportunities for streamers to retain loyal subscribers over time. The concept of bundling isn't new. Companies in the space have been doing it with their own services for years. Apple, for instance, offers Apple One, which combines Apple TV+ with other services like Apple Music and Apple Arcade. The bundle launched globally in late 2020. Disney, which has also been offering a bundle with Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+, officially began its domestic rollout of a one-app experience late last year that incorporates Hulu content via Disney+ — a similar play to Paramount's Showtime combination as well as the integration of HBO Max and Discovery+, which both merged their respective services last year. The move toward partnerships among competing media companies, though, has gained traction recently. Just last week, Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) and Disney (DIS) announced a new streaming bundle that will bring together Disney+, Hulu, and Max streaming services, with a launch date set for this summer in the US."
Bank of America explains why it’s not just about Nvidia anymore,"It's not just about NVDA anymore, according to analysts at Bank of America on Monday, with the firm stating that fundamentals are broadening out. BofA notes that Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) takes center stage this week, reporting earnings on Wednesday, May 22. ""The bar has been high this earnings season, especially for Tech, and our Semi analyst sees more volatility ahead,"" wrote the investment bank. ""But it's not just about NVDA anymore."" The bank feels that AI benefits are broadening to power, commodities, and Utilities. They also believe that fundamentals are broadening, and so should the market. ""NVDA drove 37% of S&P earnings growth over the LTM (and 11% of return), but is expected to drive just 9% over the next 12 months,"" explains the bank. ""Hyperscalers are in the first year of a multi-year AI investment cycle. Avoid capex growers."" Furthermore, BofA highlights that NVDA options are pricing in an 8.5% implied move for Q1 earnings, much lower than the reaction to three of the last five quarters. Overall, BofA says stock reactions to earnings suggest that the bar is high this earnings season. ""Companies that beat on both sales and EPS outperformed the S&P 500 by just 30bps the next day, much lower than the historical average of 150bps,"" states the bank. ""Conversely, companies that missed got penalized much more than usual, underperforming the S&P 500 by 350bps vs. the historical average of 240bps.""

"Meta’s investors are worried about the billions it’s spending on AI—but its advertising empire makes it a positive, Deutsche Bank says","Meta is betting the farm on AI, and it’s alarming its investors. In its earnings report Wednesday, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the tech giant was raising its estimates for capital expenditures, which includes spending on AI training and data centers, by billions of dollars—and it anticipates it will scale up even more down the line. Meta raised its spending estimates to $35-$40 billion, up from $30-$37 billion. “We expect capital expenditures will continue to increase [in 2025] as we invest aggressively to support our ambitious AI research and product development efforts,” CFO Susan Li said. Those huge spending numbers scared investors enough to send shares plunging up to 16% immediately following the release. But Deutsche Bank says shareholders are wrong to fear Meta’s huge wager on AI: its pole position in the advertising game makes it a prime contender to benefit in the long run. “As the fastest growing ad platform at scale, we argue Meta is actually leaning into Gen AI from a position of strength,” wrote the bank in a research note issued following the earnings release. “Meta is entering an investment cycle. We have been here a couple of times before, and each time it ended the same way...good for Meta's longer-term equity value.” Meta has already rolled out multiple consumer-facing AI tools, including AI-enabled smart glasses built in collaboration with Ray-Ban and its open-source Llama 3 AI model. But Deutsche Bank says that recommendation algorithms are the place AI is going to make the biggest difference for Meta. Meta’s most popular apps, including Instagram, Facebook, and Threads, are already leveraging AI to push customized content into users’ feeds—and they’re all proven profit generators. Deutsche Bank pointed out that on Facebook, an app typically associated with seeing content posted by a user’s friends, 30% of posts viewed are AI-recommended, and that number rises to 50% for Instagram. Leveraging AI in the Reels algorithm has resulted in users spending 8-10% more time on the app. Given that Meta already has the advertising game figured out for these apps, using AI recommendations to increase the amount of time users are spending on them is a clear path to more revenue. “AI-driven ranking and targeting improvements continue to boost ad efficiency, while Reels' ad load continues to converge towards that of feed and stories,” Deutsche Bank wrote. “We see Gen AI driving the next leg of growth for Meta by: 1) increasing engagement and use cases for users with products and services such as Meta AI and Agents for creators; 2) unified AI-powered recommendations across apps, which is now driving more than 50% of the content viewed on IG; [and] 3) driving automation for advertisers.” Investors might not see the results immediately, though. Zuckerberg said on the earnings call that ""we’ve historically seen a lot of volatility in our stock during this phase of our product playbook where we’re investing and scaling a new product but aren’t yet monetizing it.” Meta has already poured close to $50 billion into its metaverse initiatives, which have yet to yield any clear benefits. And Meta has signaled it’s still at the early stages of pumping money into its AI plans, meaning investors should brace for more big spending numbers in the future. “Meta is making bigger investments in AI than we anticipated, which will likely result in capital expenditures being much higher, for far longer,” Deutsche Bank wrote. In the long run, though, Deutsche Bank argues that AI’s usefulness for ads, the backbone of Facebook’s business model, positions the investment for big long-term gains."
"Ether, Bitcoin Open Asia Trading Week Flat as ETH ETF Decision, Nvidia Earnings Loom","ETH and BTC are trading flat as Asia's business week opens. Traders are looking at the ETH ETF decision, and Nvidia earnings this week. The crypto market was listless early Monday, with bitcoin {{BTC}}, the biggest digital asset market by value, trading flat at $67,156 and ether {{ETH}} changing hands at $3,127, according to CoinDesk Indices data. The consolidation follows a week of bullish action triggered by renewed optimism about a U.S. rate cut and the rally in stocks. Things could soon get busier again with the first decisions for ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) due. The Securities and Exchange Commission is set to weigh in on VanEck's ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) on May 23 and the Ark/21 Shares one on May 24, as well as Nvidia earnings. March Zheng, managing partner of Bizantine Capital, told CoinDesk in an interview that while the market has priced near the certainty of a rejection, there are still some reasons to be optimistic. ""There are reasons to believe that the report will contain silver linings for the delay, which should signal an eventual approval of Ethereum in the next year,"" Zheng said. ""The removal of staking prepositions by filers reclassifies underlying ETH as commodities supported by the CFTC and can pave a major pathway going forward."" Polymarket currently gives a 10% chance of an ether ETF being approved by May 31, a 13% chance of approval by June 30, and a 28% chance of approval this year. Recently, Coinbase analyst David Han wrote that the market may be ""underestimating the timing and odds of a potential approval."" Zheng argued that positive ETH ETF news might also boost trading sentiments for BASE, a Layer-2 network, whose native token's price has dropped by nearly 25% in the last two weeks."

Alphabet to spotlight AI innovations at developer conference,"By Max A. Cherney SAN FRANCISCO, May 14 (Reuters) - Alphabet is expected to announce on Tuesday how it is building on artificial intelligence across its businesses, a day after OpenAI demonstrated a new AI model that can work with sound and images in addition to text. The annual I/O developer event is typically when Alphabet showcases its latest new technology and whatever it unveils will help investors evaluate its progress against Microsoft backed OpenAI. This event serves as a critical indicator of Alphabet's competitive position in tech as it introduces AI into products such as search, used by billions of people around the world. Google is expected to launch the next version of its Android operating system and a host of updates to its most advanced AI technology called Gemini. A day ahead of the event, Google teased in a video a piece of software which appeared to demonstrate AI software that could draw conclusions about the live feed from the camera. The phone operator asked several questions and the app answered in a virtual-assistant-like voice. The software looked to have similar capabilities as one of the features demonstrated by OpenAI in its launch of its latest AI model, GPT-4o. OpenAI on Monday showcased its new multimodal AI model called GPT-4o, which enables ChatGPT to respond via voice in real-time and be interrupted, both hallmarks of realistic voice conversations that AI voice assistants like Google Assistant have found challenging. The company said it would be offering it to ChatGPT users for free, with no advertisements. The conference is held at the Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View, California. CEO Sundar Pichai and other executives are expected to begin presenting at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time. (Reporting by Max A.

4 Semiconductor Stocks Likely to Beat Earnings Estimates,"The overall earnings for the semiconductor industry this earnings season are expected to be better than the year-ago quarter. After a challenging period marked by economic headwinds and disruptions in the supply chain, semiconductor stocks appear to be on the brink of a significant comeback, fueled by a steady increase in sales. The semiconductor market grappled with challenges arising from pandemic-induced disruptions in the supply chain and the Federal Reserve's stringent monetary policies, which subdued demand and led to a decline in sales. However, with the easing of inflationary pressures and a gradual recovery in demand, the industry has been on an upward trajectory since the second quarter of 2023. The advent of generative AI has further attracted investments. The technology has already proven beneficial across a variety of industries, including marketing, advertising, customer service, education, content creation, healthcare, automotive, energy and utilities and video game development. The growing proliferation of generative AI has boosted the demand for chips, benefiting semiconductor sales. According to the latest data released by the Semiconductor Industry Association, global semiconductor sales grew 16.3% to $46.2 billion in February 2024. This year-over-year growth trend has persisted for four consecutive months, signifying a decent recovery. With the presence of several industry participants, finding the right tech stocks with the potential to beat on earnings can be daunting. However, our proprietary methodology makes this task fairly simple. You could narrow down your choices by looking at stocks that have the perfect combination of two key elements — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for determining stocks that have maximum chances of beating estimates in their next earnings announcement. It is the percentage difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Our research shows that for stocks with this favorable mix of ingredients, the odds of a positive earnings surprise are as high as 70%. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD is scheduled to report first-quarter 2024 results on Apr 30. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has an Earnings ESP of +28.33% at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Advanced Micro Devices’ revenues is pegged at $5.42 million, which indicates a 1.2% increase from the year-ago quarter. The consensus estimate for the bottom line has been revised upward by a penny to 60 cents per share over the past seven days. Estimates for first-quarter earnings signify flat growth on a year-over-year basis."
Google-backed Anthropic releases Claude chatbot across Europe,"By Martin Coulter LONDON (Reuters) - Artificial intelligence startup Anthropic, which is backed by Alphabet's Google and Amazon.com, said it would release its generative AI chatbot Claude across Europe on Tuesday. WHY IT'S IMPORTANT Anthropic's Claude is a direct competitor to Microsoft-backed OpenAI's ChatGPT, the chatbot that broke records when it reached 100 million monthly active users just two months after launch. While the Claude chatbot was already freely available online in a number of countries, this is the first time it has been made available via the web and iPhones across the European Union, as well as a handful of non-EU countries in Europe such as Switzerland and Iceland. European business customers will also be able to access the ""Claude Team"" plan, which will cost 28 euros ($30.21) per month before value-added tax. CONTEXT Anthropic was set up by former executives at OpenAI and siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei. Earlier this month, the firm jumped into the race to capture corporate dollars, launching a version of its chatbot aimed at businesses. The move could yet bring it into competition with its backers Amazon and Google, who likewise want to capture business spending on AI. KEY QUOTE"
EXPLAINER-What risks do advanced AI models pose in the wrong hands?,"(Adds link, Microsoft ban on state-backed hacking groups using its AI products in paragraph 22) By Alexandra Alper WASHINGTON, May 9 (Reuters) - The Biden administration is poised to open up a new front in its effort to safeguard U.S. AI from China and Russia with preliminary plans to place guardrails around the most advanced AI models, Reuters reported on Wednesday. Government and private sector researchers worry U.S. adversaries could use the models, which mine vast amounts of text and images to summarize information and generate content, to wage aggressive cyber attacks or even create potent biological weapons. Here are some threats posed by AI: DEEPFAKES AND MISINFORMATION Deepfakes - realistic yet fabricated videos created by AI algorithms trained on copious online footage - are surfacing on social media, blurring fact and fiction in the polarized world of U.S. politics. While such synthetic media has been around for several years, it's been turbocharged over the past year by a slew of new ""generative AI"" tools such as Midjourney that make it cheap and easy to create convincing deepfakes. Image creation tools powered by artificial intelligence from companies including OpenAI and Microsoft, can be used to produce photos that could promote election or voting-related disinformation, despite each having policies against creating misleading content, researchers said in a report in March. Some disinformation campaigns simply harness the ability of AI to mimic real news articles as a means of disseminating false information. While major social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube have made efforts to prohibit and remove deepfakes, their effectiveness at policing such content varies. For example, last year, a Chinese government-controlled news site using a generative AI platform pushed a previously circulated false claim that the United States was running a lab in Kazakhstan to create biological weapons for use against China, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said in its 2024 homeland threat assessment."
YouTube to block Hong Kong protest anthem videos after court order,"By Jeffrey Dastin and James Pomfret MOUNTAIN VIEW/HONG KONG (Reuters) -Alphabet's YouTube on Tuesday said it would comply with a court decision and block access inside Hong Kong to 32 video links deemed prohibited content, in what critics say is a blow to freedoms in the financial hub amid a security clampdown. The action follows a government application granted by Hong Kong's Court of Appeal requesting the ban of a protest anthem called ""Glory to Hong Kong."" The judges warned that dissidents seeking to incite secession could weaponize the song for use against the state. In comments criticizing the court order, YouTube said the ruling would raise skepticism around the Hong Kong government's work to foster the digital economy and reclaim its reputation as a predictable place for doing business. ""We are disappointed by the Court's decision but are complying with its removal order,"" YouTube said in a statement, saying it shared human rights groups' concerns that the content ban could chill free expression online. ""We'll continue to consider our options for an appeal, to promote access to information."" Some observers, including the U.S. government, say the ban will further undermine Hong Kong's international reputation as a financial hub, and raise concerns about the erosion of freedoms and its commitment to the free flow of information. ""It is not a desirable situation from the perspective of free internet and free speech,"" said George Chen, co-chair of digital practice at the Asia Group, a Washington DC-based business policy consultancy. He is also former head of public policy for Greater China at Meta. ""Now the question is how far and how aggressive the government wants to go,"" Chen added. ""If you start to send platforms 100 or 1,000 links for takedown every day, this will drive platforms crazy and also make global investors more worried about Hong Kong’s free market environment. How predictable and how stable the policy environment is matters a lot to foreign investors, and Hong Kong is now at a crossroads to defend its reputation."" Industry groups, including the Asia Internet Coalition, which represents big tech firms like Meta, Apple and Google, have said keeping a free and open internet in Hong Kong is ""fundamental"" to maintaining the city's edge. The Hong Kong government did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
"Welcome to the AI dystopia no one asked for, courtesy of Silicon Valley","Editor’s Note: A version of this story appeared in CNN Business’ Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free, here. A couple of weeks ago, I rewatched Jurassic Park for probably the 10th time since the movie came out 30 years ago. (As an aside, it really holds up — 10/10, no notes.) Early in the plot, when the guests are discussing their impressions of the park, Jeff Goldblum’s character (also 10/10, just perfect) launches into a speech so prescient you could sub out all the dinosaur stuff and map it onto the modern debate around artificial intelligence. “Don’t you see the danger, John, inherent in what you’re doing here? Genetic power is the most awesome force the planet’s ever seen, but you wield it like a kid that’s found his dad’s gun … You stood on the shoulders of geniuses to accomplish something as fast as you could, and before you even knew what you had, you patented it, and packaged it, and slapped it on a plastic lunchbox, and now you’re selling it.” And then comes the line that later launched a thousand memes: “Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn’t stop to think if they should.” Naturally, the skeptic of the group is dismissed as a Luddite and the movie carries on. (Spoiler alert: The Luddite was right!) AI skeptics — who are legion, and not necessarily part of the fringe tin foil hat crowd — are begging Silicon Valley to take a beat before unleashing AI to the world. But tech companies, faced with the most powerful computing innovation in a generation, are running around like kids who just found their dad’s gun. See here: Apple and Google — which, to be sure, deserve a lot of credit for the innovations they’ve brought to the world — have recently latched on to AI-powered features to help sell their newest tablets and smartphones. After all, throwing AI into your pitch deck is a surefire way to signal to shareholders that you’re on the cutting edge, which helps distract from the fact that your company hasn’t actually produced any significant proprietary tech in years. In marketing those new devices, though, Apple and Google have lost the plot."
Big Tech is pouring billions into British AI investments—but the U.K. risks becoming a sidekick to U.S. tech giants,"Microsoft’s plan to open a new AI hub in London is a huge endorsement for the U.K. as a world leader in AI. But I do question whether it is wholly good news for the long-term. The U.K. has shown time and again that some of the very best AI expertise in the world lies here. The pool of talent we have available in this country, the standard of research and development present in our academic institutions, and the U.K.’s (generally) stable economic conditions have, for decades, made our island nation a highly attractive place for tech’s big hitters to lay down roots. That’s why American businesses come here, as well as companies from Japan, China, South Korea, Germany, and Singapore. And recent history highlights the real pedigree we have in software process and design. In a recent interview, Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt declared his wishes for building a “British Microsoft,” warning that such an endeavor would take a decade to materialize. But it wouldn’t be the first time the U.K. has produced a tech titan of its own. I previously spent more than 20 years working at Arm, starting in the 1990s. During this time, the company grew from a small spinout (named Acorn Computers) in Cambridge, to a global tech behemoth. It became, arguably, the largest processor company in the world. This was made possible by talent from the likes of Cambridge, Oxford, UCL, Southampton, Manchester, and many other British academic institutions. We were the world leaders. Another breakthrough moment for U.K. AI was the founding of DeepMind in 2010. It was one of the most exciting AI companies in the world. But DeepMind was then acquired by Google in 2014 for a $400 million (a massive figure at the time). So why is it that with all this talent, our attention seems to constantly be on moves made by companies and capital from overseas, rather than focusing on building and keeping our own tech ventures, and turning them into the world players they could be? The fact that we herald the likes of Microsoft further embedding themselves into the fabric of U.K. tech surely begs the question as to why, as a nation, we haven’t cracked the code for building tech heavyweights of our own. Our universities are very capable of creating spinouts, the funding environment is conducive for raising, and early-stage venture capital is accessible. However, the capital required for these companies to continue growing and being capable of challenging the best tech businesses worldwide simply doesn’t exist. This is a challenge that the U.K. government isn’t yet addressing. We need to ensure that U.K. startups have the ability to scale and remain in the U.K. The goliath-sized funding round raised by U.K. self-driving car technology startup Wayve is a perfect example of this capital tipping point issue in action. The company recently secured $1.05 billion (£840 million) in funding led by Japan’s SoftBank, with Microsoft and Nvidia also participating. This is the largest known investment in an AI company in the U.K.—and more broadly Europe—to date, and it was once again driven by overseas capital."
Meta's oversight board backs takedown of Australian voter fraud posts,"By Byron Kaye SYDNEY (Reuters) - Meta's oversight board upheld a decision to remove two Facebook posts calling for Australians to vote multiple times in an indigenous rights referendum, but noted the social media giant had not adequately explained its ban on encouraging voter fraud. The board, which is funded by Meta but run independently, said Meta was correct to protect the democratic process by preventing voter fraud when it proactively pulled the posts ahead of the 2023 vote. But Meta's public-facing rules were not clear enough, the board said in a ruling published on Thursday. ""Since it is crucial that users can engage on social media to discuss public-interest issues about democratic events, Meta needs to clearly inform users of the rules,"" it said. The decision comes as Australia's government plans to introduce penalties for internet platforms which fail to rein in misinformation and disinformation. Last October, Australians voted down a proposal to constitutionally recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people amid fears that a misinformation campaign was influencing voters. In the posts under review, two Facebook users separately uploaded screenshots showing partial statements posted by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) on X (formerly Twitter). The screenshots showed the words ""if someone votes at two different polling places within their electorate, and places their formal vote in the ballot box at each polling place, their vote is counted"". The posts failed to mention that voting multiple times is an offence in Australia. One Facebook user shared the screenshot with the caption ""vote early, vote often, and vote NO"", while the other user posted the screenshot with the comment: ""so you can vote multiple times ... they are setting us up for a 'rigging' ... smash the voting centres ... it's a No, No, No, No, No"". In both cases, Meta proactively identified the posts, which were automatically sent for human review before being removed, but the users appealed the decision, the oversight board said."
Amazon (AMZN) Q1 Earnings: Taking a Look at Key Metrics Versus Estimates,"Amazon (AMZN) reported $143.31 billion in revenue for the quarter ended March 2024, representing a year-over-year increase of 12.5%. EPS of $1.13 for the same period compares to $0.31 a year ago. The reported revenue represents a surprise of +0.55% over the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $142.53 billion. With the consensus EPS estimate being $0.83, the EPS surprise was +36.14%. While investors closely watch year-over-year changes in headline numbers -- revenue and earnings -- and how they compare to Wall Street expectations to determine their next course of action, some key metrics always provide a better insight into a company's underlying performance. As these metrics influence top- and bottom-line performance, comparing them to the year-ago numbers and what analysts estimated helps investors project a stock's price performance more accurately. Here is how Amazon performed in the just reported quarter in terms of the metrics most widely monitored and projected by Wall Street analysts: Third-party seller services Y/Y Change: 16% versus 15.6% estimated by seven analysts on average. Subscription services Y/Y Change: 11% compared to the 10.8% average estimate based on seven analysts. Online stores Y/Y Change: 7% compared to the 7.2% average estimate based on seven analysts. Headcount - Total: 1,521,000 versus the two-analyst average estimate of 1,496,412. Net Sales- AWS: $25.04 billion versus the 11-analyst average estimate of $24.26 billion. The reported number represents a year-over-year change of +17.3%."
Are Robust Financials Driving The Recent Rally In Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Stock?,"Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 13% over the last three months. Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. Specifically, we decided to study Alphabet's  ROE in this article. Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.  View our latest analysis for Alphabet  ROE can be calculated by using the formula: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Alphabet is: 28% = US$82b ÷ US$293b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024). The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.28 in profit. Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features. First thing first, we like that Alphabet has an impressive ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 7.4% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. Probably as a result of this, Alphabet was able to see a decent net income growth of 18% over the last five years."
How To Earn $500 A Month From Meta Platforms Stock Following Upbeat Q1 Earnings,"Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) posted better-than-expected earnings and sales results for its first quarter on April 24. The company reported roughly 3.24 billion Family Daily Active People in the first quarter. That’s up 7% year-over-year. The company said capital spending is likely to increase in future years as its artificial intelligence roadmap is supported. The European Commission reportedly plans to investigate Meta's Facebook and Instagram over concerns regarding Russia disinformation, with suspicions of inadequate moderation. Some Meta investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends. As of now, Meta has a dividend yield of 0.46%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 50 cents a share ($2.00 a year). To figure out how to earn $500 monthly from Meta, we start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months). Next, we take this amount and divide it by Meta's $2.00 dividend: $6,000 / $2.00  = 3,000 shares So, an investor would need to own approximately $1,317,570 worth of Meta Platforms, or 3,000 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500. Assuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $2.00 = 600 shares, or $263,514 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100.

"The biggest risk to investing in 'Magnificent 7' stocks like Nvidia and Amazon, according to top CEOs","What's a glitzy investing conference without a little ""Magnificent Seven"" banter? ""The risk is simple — those stocks don't do well,"" Avenue Capital Group founder and CEO Marc Lasry told Yahoo Finance at the Milken Institute Global Conference on Monday. Lasry was answering a question about the risk of overcrowding into tech names such as Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA) — aka the Magnificent Seven. ""What has happened is when people are nervous, they invest in things that they know really well and they believe are going to be around,"" Lasry added. ""But I don't know what happens in the next year. I do know on the credit side, you've got all these opportunities."" The former co-owner of the Milwaukee Bucks, Lasry has been investing in credit markets for more than four decades, giving him a reported net worth of $1.9 billion. So suffice it to say, Lasry has seen a few investing cycles and market crazes. And the Magnificent Seven could be viewed as a craze. Altogether, the Magnificent Seven stocks were responsible for about 37% of the S&P 500's 10.2% gain in the first quarter, according to data from S&P Global Indices. In 2023, the cohort constituted roughly two-thirds of the S&P 500's advance. The optimism in the group reflects profit enthusiasm on everything from Nvidia's AI chips to Microsoft's Copilot productivity tool. But with investors now more closely scrutinizing the Magnificent Seven amid higher interest rates, shares have slowed their roll."

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to 5 Biggest Publicly Traded AI Companies in the World. On May 8, Stuart Kaiser, Citi's Head of Equity Trading Strategy, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance where he discussed the role of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in shaping the market for artificial intelligence. Kaiser suggests that the company's earnings report may be the biggest event to look forward to right now, especially for equity holders, according to the S&P 500 index. He also highlighted that if the 10-year rate was pinned at 4.75%, equities would not be largely impacted if NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) misses earnings on May 22nd. The interviewer then directs the conversation to discuss the volatility of the stock. The stock went down to $735 and $740 a couple of weeks ago, to which Kaiser emphasized how NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) poses a macro risk to the market, keeping in mind that it is priced for a significant swing of 10%. Companies like Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) went down double digitals, and big tech stocks, now stabilized, also have been down in correlation. To put NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) position into perspective, the company's earnings report and the way big and small tech companies react to it are extremely crucial to the AI space at the moment. The interviewer then questions how megacap tech stocks upheld their leadership position in the market. The interviewer highlights that the NASDAQ 100 hit a high in July last year and mid-January this year, and has been sideways since, relative to the S&P 500 index. Kaiser highlights the magnificent seven including, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA),  held 70% of the market cap last year, however, now they position in the 40% to 50% range, with names like Meta and Tesla not performing as well. He also suggested that the best-case scenario would be NVIDIA missing due to high demand and low supply, indicating that the market is still in high demand. He closed the interview by highlighting that if the industry is to keep progressing, NVIDIA is to keep working harder. You can also take a look at the best AI stocks that will skyrocket.

UPDATE 1-US lawmakers unveil bill to make it easier to restrict exports of AI models,"(Adds administration input in paragraphs 3-4) WASHINGTON, May 9 (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of lawmakers unveiled a bill late Wednesday that would make it easier for the Biden administration to impose export controls on AI models, in a bid to safeguard the prized U.S. technology against foreign bad actors. The bill, sponsored by House Republicans Michael McCaul and John Molenaar and Democrats Raja Krishnamoorthi and Susan Wild, would also give the Commerce Department express authority to bar Americans from working with foreigners to develop AI systems that pose risks to U.S. national security. The legislation aims to bulletproof any future AI export regulations from legal challenges and was crafted with input from Biden administration officials. It comes as worries mount that U.S. adversaries could use the models, which mine vast amounts of text and images to summarize information and generate content, to wage aggressive cyber attacks or even create potent biological weapons. The Commerce Department and White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the legislation. Reuters reported on Wednesday that the United States is poised to open up a new front in its effort to safeguard U.S. AI from China and Russia with preliminary plans to impose export controls on the most advanced proprietary AI Models. But under existing U.S. law, it is much more difficult for the Commerce Department, which oversees U.S. export policy, to regulate the export of open source AI models, which can be freely downloaded. If approved, the measure would remove roadblocks to regulating the export of open source AI contained in the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and also give the Commerce Department express authority to regulate AI systems. China has been heavily relying on many open source models developed in the West such as Meta Platforms’ “Llama” series. In March, the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence, a high-level research lab, was quoted by Chinese state media as stating that the majority of homegrown Chinese AI models were in fact built using Meta's Llama models and that this posed a key challenge to China's AI development."

Microsoft pledges $4.3 billion investment at Macron’s ‘Choose France’ summit,"PARIS (AP) — Microsoft announced its most substantial commitment yet to France, pledging on Monday to invest 4 billion euros ($4.3 billion) this year to bolster the country’s burgeoning artificial intelligence sector. The move is part of a broader effort unveiled during President Emmanuel Macron’s pro-business event, Choose France, which aims to attract foreign investment and stimulate economic growth. Microsoft’s vice chair and president, Brad Smith, visited the company’s French headquarters with Macron. “We will build out the computing capacity here in France,"" Smith said. ""We will put this infrastructure to work for everyone in France.” The plan includes expanding next-generation Cloud and AI infrastructure and delivering up to 25,000 of the most advanced GPUs, or graphics processing units, to France by the end of 2025. Additionally, Microsoft will launch an AI skilling initiative to train 1 million French people by the end of 2027, emphasizing the importance of equipping citizens with future-ready skills. The announcement was made as part of the annual Choose France summit, created by Macron in 2018. The summit, held this year at the Palace of Versailles, was attended by 180 international CEOs and senior business executives. It highlighted foreign investments totaling a reported 15 billion euros, surpassing last year’s 13 billion euros raised through 28 projects. Macron addressed the necessity of advancing AI technology in Europe and told Microsoft staff, “We are entering a totally different world where the competition will be ferocious, and we can only win this competition if we have trusted partners, and you are among them.” This significant investment underscores Microsoft’s commitment to supporting French growth in the AI economy and marks a milestone in the ongoing efforts to enhance France’s position as a global leader in technology and innovation.

"Zacks.com featured highlights BellRing Brands, ResMed, NVIDIA and Transdigm","Chicago, IL – May 15, 2024 – Stocks in this week’s article are BellRing Brands BRBR, ResMed RMD, NVIDIA NVDA and Transdigm Group TDG. Earnings growth is the highest priority for any start-up or a renowned company. This is because a company won't last long if it doesn’t make money. So, what is earnings growth? Study a company’s revenues over a given period, subtract the production cost, and you have earnings. By the way, this is also considered the most important variable influencing share price. But, expectations of earnings play a noteworthy role. Frequently, we have seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in price following an earnings decline. This is largely the result of a company’s earnings failing to meet market expectations. Earnings estimates embody analysts’ opinions on factors such as sales growth, product demand, competitive industry environment, profit margins, and cost control. Thus, earnings estimates serve as a valuable tool, while making investment decisions. Earnings estimates also help analysts assess the cash flow to determine the fair value of a firm. Thus, investors should look for stocks ready to make a big move. Hence, investors need to buy stocks with historical earnings growth and are seeing a rise in quarterly and annual earnings estimates. The above criteria narrowed the universe of around 7,839 stocks to only 21. Here are the top four stocks that stand out: BellRing Brands manufactures and sells nutrition products. The company has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). BRBR’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 34.9%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. ResMed holds a major position worldwide as a designer, manufacturer and distributor of generators, masks and related accessories. The company has a Zacks Rank #1.

UPDATE 1-US lawmaker probes FTC work with Europe to block Amazon iRobot merger,"(Adds no comment from FTC, more details) By David Shepardson WASHINGTON, May 1 (Reuters) - The chair of the House Oversight Committee said on Wednesday he is investigating the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) work with the European Commission in the collapse of Amazon.com's plan to acquire iRobot Corp in a $1.4 billion deal. Amazon and robot vacuum maker iRobot in January dropped their plans to tie-up in the face of opposition from European and U.S. antitrust regulators. ""The FTC’s anticompetitive actions threaten to harm America’s global position in the personal robotics market, while ceding market share of personal robotics to foreign entities such as China,"" Republican Representative James Comer said in a letter to the FTC asking for documents shared by the FTC with the European Commission. ""The FTC’s actions indicate to American businesses that the FTC will work outside of U.S. antitrust law by using the EC to realize its desired outcomes."" The FTC declined to comment. Amazon and iRobot did not immediately comment. After the deal collapsed, iRobot in January announced a significant restructuring plan to reduce costs and said it would cut about 31% of its workforce, or 350 jobs. The company also said founder Colin Angle had stepped down as its CEO. Amazon said in January the deal had no path to regulatory approval in the European Union. EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager in January said its in-depth investigation preliminarily showed ""the acquisition of iRobot would have enabled Amazon to foreclose iRobot's rivals by restricting or degrading access to Amazon stores."" Separately, the FTC was poised to reject Amazon's deal before the companies announced they were abandoning it, a source told Reuters in January."
OpenAI considers allowing users to create AI-generated pornography,"OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is exploring whether users should be allowed to create artificial intelligence-generated pornography and other explicit content with its products. While the company stressed its ban on deepfakes would continue to apply to the adult material, campaigners suggested the proposal undermined its mission statement to produce “safe and beneficial” AI. OpenAI, which is also the developer of the DALL-E image generator, revealed it was considering letting developers and users “responsibly” create what it termed not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content through its products. OpenAI said this could include “erotica, extreme gore, slurs, and unsolicited profanity”. It said: “We’re exploring whether we can responsibly provide the ability to generate NSFW content in age-appropriate contexts … We look forward to better understanding user and societal expectations of model behaviour in this area.” The proposal was published as part of an OpenAI document discussing how it develops its AI tools. Joanne Jang, an employee at the San Francisco-based company who worked on the document, told the US news organisation NPR that OpenAI wanted to start a discussion about whether the generation of erotic text and nude images should always be banned from its products. However, she stressed that deepfakes would not be allowed. “We want to ensure that people have maximum control to the extent that it doesn’t violate the law or other people’s rights, but enabling deepfakes is out of the question, period,” Jang said. “This doesn’t mean that we are trying now to create AI porn.” However, she conceded that whether the output was considered pornography “depends on your definition”, adding: “These are the exact conversations we want to have.” Jang said there were “creative cases in which content involving sexuality or nudity is important to our users”, but this would be explored in an “age-appropriate context”. The Collins dictionary refers to erotica as “works of art that show or describe sexual activity, and which are intended to arouse sexual feelings”."
Intel CEO confident in its AI future after posting soft guidance,"After several steps forward with investors, it's a few steps back for Intel (INTC). Shares of the chipmaker fell 8% on Friday, following several hiccups in its first quarter results and second quarter guidance. While the company's first quarter earnings managed to surpass forecasts by $0.05, its guidance for the rest of the year came below consensus. ""We have a lot of great things happening in the second half of the year. We feel very comfortable with the outlook we have,"" Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said to Yahoo Finance. The selling pressure on Intel's stock stems from two areas. First, results for the quarter were constrained by a wafer supply issue that Wall Street failed to properly model. And second, there was some demand softness from customers — which is causing Intel execs to be on the cautious side for the second quarter guidance. Intel expects second quarter sales of between $12.5 billion and $13.5 billion. Analysts were anticipating $13.63 billion. Earnings are projected at $0.10 per share, short of analyst forecasts for $0.24. ""We believe Intel has a difficult road ahead as the company begins a multi-year transition phase which involves high capital intensity and an ambitious design roadmap with expectations to move through five process node transitions in four years,"" Stifel analyst Ruben Roy said in a client note. Roy maintained a Hold rating on Intel's stock. The company's tepid guidance overshadowed a couple of wins in the quarter and in the past two months."
Possible Bearish Signals With Advanced Micro Devices Insiders Disposing Stock,"In the last year, many Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period. Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.  See our latest analysis for Advanced Micro Devices  Over the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive VP & GM of Data Center Solutions Business Unit, Forrest Norrod, for US$5.3m worth of shares, at about US$176 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$147). So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels. In the last year Advanced Micro Devices insiders didn't buy any company stock. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below! If you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying. Over the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Advanced Micro Devices. In total, insiders sold US$7.0m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain. For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Advanced Micro Devices insiders own about US$1.3b worth of shares (which is 0.5% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders. Insiders haven't bought Advanced Micro Devices stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. For example - Advanced Micro Devices has 2 warning signs we think you should be aware of. If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt."

UPDATE 1-Amazon unveils first electric seaport trucks amid push to slash tailpipe emissions,"(Adds Amazon executive comment in paragraph 7, Volvo executive comment in paragraph 9, Forum Mobility executive comment in paragraph 12) By Lisa Baertlein LOS ANGELES, May 7 (Reuters) - Amazon.com on Tuesday unveiled the first of a dozen Volvo electric big rigs it plans to deploy this year to pick up cargo from the nation's busiest container seaport in Southern California. The e-commerce giant already has eight of those semi trucks in use at the Los Angeles/Long Beach port complex, where every so-called drayage truck must be zero-emissions by 2035. The deployment is a first for Amazon, extending its vehicle electrification projects from ocean ports to customer doorsteps. The effort is vital to the company's push to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040. So far, a little more than 1% of the 23,761 trucks that serve the Los Angeles/Long Beach port complex are zero-emission vehicles - including 201 electric rigs, Long Beach port spokesman Lee Peterson said. ""Heavy-duty trucking is a particularly difficult area to decarbonize,"" said Udit Madan, Amazon's vice president of worldwide operations. The company has rolled out more than 13,500 Rivian electric cargo delivery vans across the country since 2022. The transition to electric semi trucks will be a bigger lift, because they haul heavier loads and their batteries require more intensive charging infrastructure. ""There is no playbook,"" said Adam Baker, vice president of global logistics for Amazon. For now, the company is gathering data on battery performance that will help determine how many trucks will be needed. The manufacturer of Amazon's electric drayage trucks will continue working with the company and JAB Hunt, which provides drivers for the rigs, throughout the deployment, said Keith Brandis, vice president of partnerships and system solutions at Volvo Trucks North America."
"Bill Gates Sells Microsoft, Berkshire Hathaway Shares In Q1: Are These Still Top Positions?","Billionaire Bill Gates is best known as the co-founder and former CEO of Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT).

Datacenter End Market Demand to Aid NVIDIA's (NVDA) Q1 Earnings,"NVIDIA Corporation NVDA is set to announce its first-quarter fiscal 2025 results on May 22. The first-quarter performance of NVIDIA is anticipated to reflect the continued strength of its datacenter end market. This segment is likely to have experienced substantial growth, driven by the rising demand for generative artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models that utilize NVIDIA’s Hopper and Ampere architecture graphic processing units (GPUs). In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, NVIDIA recorded unprecedented revenues in its datacenter market, mainly due to heightened investments in generative AI. Datacenter revenues soared 409% year over year and 27% sequentially to $18.4 billion. This positive trend is expected to have continued in the current quarter. Projections suggest that first-quarter revenues for the data center market may reach $20.4 billion, marking impressive year-over-year growth of 376% and a sequential rise of 11%. NVIDIA Corporation price-eps-surprise | NVIDIA Corporation Quote The advent of OpenAI’s ChatGPT has thrust generative AI into the spotlight, signaling the start of a potential AI boom. Generative AI, supported by large language models, can produce a variety of content, including texts, images, audio and synthetic data, revolutionizing industries by modernizing workflows. The global generative AI market size is anticipated to reach $967.6 billion by 2032, according to a new report by Fortune Business Insights. The market is expected to expand at a CAGR of 39.6% from 2024 to 2032. ChatGPT’s adoption by enterprises has shown its value across sectors such as marketing, customer service and healthcare. The implementation of generative AI requires significant computational power and expertise, prompting enterprises to upgrade their infrastructure. NVIDIA’s next-generation chips, known for their high computing power, are well-suited for these demands. As NVIDIA’s GPUs are used in AI models across industries like automotive, healthcare and manufacturing, the demand for its high-performance chips is projected to increase further. NVIDIA expects strong revenue growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, reaching $24 billion, driven by increased AI investments in the datacenter market. Currently, NVIDIA sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). NVDA shares have soared 86.8% year to date (YTD)."

Walmart Is Firing On All Cylinders And That Includes Its Newer Businesses That Go Beyond Groceries,"On Thursday, Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT) surpassed estimates with fiscal first quarter earnings and revenue expectations. The discounter significantly expanded its e-commerce sales and boosted profits with newer businesses, including advertising and its efforts to appeal to more affluent shoppers in order to fight off rivals like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN). While Walmart is the nation’s biggest retailer, Amazon leads when it comes to e-commerce, but Walmart is determined to stop being the underdog in this rare arena as well as to grow outside groceries. For the quarter ended on April 30th, the big box retailer reported that sales grew 6% YoY to $161.51 billion, surpassing $159.50 billion that LSEG estimated. Net income also grew from last year's comparable quarter as it amounted to $5.10 billion, or 63 cents per share. Excluding fuel, Walmart’s same-store sales in the U.S. grew 3.8%. Also excluding fuel, Sam’s Club same-store sales grew 4.4%. Boosted by its growing third-party marketplace, as well as rise of both store pickup and delivery of online orders, e-commerce sales impressively rose 22% YoY in the U.S. However, despite more visits, both physical ones to its stores and online to its website, consumers spent roughly the same compared to last year’s quarter as average ticket remained flat, but transactions rose 3.8%. But, Walmart’s newer businesses kicked in with third of YoY increase in operating income coming from that segment. Global advertising grew 24% and 26% in the U.S. alone. Like Amazon, Walmart expanded its online footprint by welcoming sellers onto its platform and offering them advertisement and fulfillment services. Its U.S., marketplace sellers rose 36%, while the total count in Mexico went up almost 80%. Walmart's grocery business has been fueled by the widening gap between fast-food and restaurant pricing versus the lower cost of home cooking. Also, for the first time, its delivery business surpassed its store pickup in terms of volume, showing that shoppers appreciate the convenience that Walmart offers, as they are coming more frequently than they have before, along with newer customers.Outlook Walmart is now expecting to hit the high end or slightly top its previous full-year guidance. It previously guided for net sales growth between 3% and 4% with adjusted earnings per share of between $2.23 and $2.37. Walmart is doing better than others. The nation’s largest retailer and private employer is often considered as an indicator of the state of the U.S. economy. However, it is doing way better than the U.S. economy during such inflationary periods as it sells essentials like groceries that made about 60% of sales in its most recent fiscal year and when it comes to staples, its value-oriented reputation precedes the big-box retailer. But, in order to fight off rivals like Amazon, Walmart is also expanding its target demographics with its efforts to appeal to younger and high-income shoppers and these new businesses both lifted its profits during the quarter and also fueled the growth of its operating margin that surpasses its sales growth. Earlier this week, Walmart announced layoffs, along with news of reallocating hundreds of employees, but CFO John David Rainey emphasized that this move is not about cost cuts but about shifting away from remote work as the company’s corporate culture is about being together. By the looks of it, Walmart management knows what it's doing. DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only. It is not intended as investing advice."
"Microsoft plans to release next Call of Duty version on subscription service, WSJ reports","(Reuters) - Microsoft plans to release the coming installment of ""Call of Duty"" videogame to its subscription service instead of the longtime approach of only selling it a la carte, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday.

A technology for creating virtual presenters shows a useful application of artificial intelligence. It also highlights one of its major risks. Every smartphone has an expiration date. That day arrives when the software updates stop coming and you start missing out on new apps and security protections. With most phones, this used to happen after about only three years. But things are finally starting to change. The new number is seven. I first noticed this shift when I reviewed Google’s $700 Pixel 8 smartphone in October. Google told me that it had committed to providing software updates for the phone for seven years, up from three year Android users are getting a bunch of new anti-theft features that Google says will help protect your private data. Typically, when a new phone like the Pixel 8a launches, the price on its predecessor drops. But that hasn't happened yet for the Pixel 7a.

"Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Microsoft, Alphabet, Nvidia and Arista Networks","Chicago, IL – May 16, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Nvidia NVDA and Arista Networks ANET. Yes, I know the last year has been all AI every day, but this theme is still early days. Exciting new products built from generative AI models are just beginning to come to market and will continue to change the way we interact with technology. Just this week there were two significant releases from both Microsoft’s, OpenAI and Alphabet. Additionally, now that broad markets have traded sideways for the better part of two months, energy has been built for a major breakout in the leading names. These product releases should be a valuable catalyst for the next big rally. OpenAI introduced the newest iteration of their primary AI model, GPT-4o. The demonstrations of GPT-4o were extremely impressive, with one video showing the AI model interacting with and tutoring a young boy on his math homework. The GPT, young boy and father were all in conversation with each other, and the GPT helped him through the process in a supportive and logical way. It was really something, and I recommend those interested seek out some of the most recent demonstrations released online. Then, at Google I/O, Alphabet’s annual developer conference, the company introduced its newest AI enabled “Agents,” built throughout its platforms. This product is built on Gemini, Alphabet’s response to OpenAI’s GPT. In one demo, the presenter wanted to return a pair of shoes they bought online. They took a picture of them, and said to the agent, “I want to return these shoes, they don’t fit.” Gemini proceeded to find the order info in Gmail, fill out a return form, and scheduled a pickup from UPS. It really functioned like a personal assistant. The presentation also showed Gemini agents planning detailed trips catered to specific interests, summarizing long email chains, and working across multiple external websites to really simplify workflow. Again, I recommend those interested go watch the demo videos."
Markets brace for Nvidia earnings: What to know this week,"Stocks have once again ended a trading week having hit new records.  Signs of an inflation cooldown prompted markets to grow more optimistic about the prospect of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts and stocks rallied as a result, with all three major averages hitting record highs on Wednesday.  For the week, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose more than 2% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) popped more than 1.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained more than 1%, closing above 40,000 for the first time ever on Friday. In the week ahead, highly anticipated earnings results from Nvidia (NVDA) are expected to be the key catalyst for markets. Results from Target (TGT), Palo Alto Networks (PANW), and Lowe's (LOW) will also be closely tracked by investors. The week is expected to be quieter on the economic front, with updates on activity in the manufacturing and services sectors as well as the final reading of consumer sentiment for May on tap. Minutes from the Fed's May meeting are also expected on Wednesday afternoon. April's reading of the Consumer Price Index showed core prices, which strip out the more volatile costs of food and gas, rose 3.6% over last year — the lowest annual rise in three years. This prompted investors to price in two full interest rate cuts this year for the first time since early April. The move brings the market closer in line with the Fed's projections of two or three interest rate cuts at some point this year. BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski listed investors' alignment with the Fed on interest rate cuts as a reason supporting his call for the S&P 500 to end 2024 at 5,600, an increase of less than 7% from Friday's close. For investors, the key question will be whether this bullish narrative is sustainable or if the market will once again jump ahead of the Fed as it did in early 2024 when investors priced in nearly seven interest rate cuts on the back of positive economic data. The first test will come on Wednesday with the release of minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's May meeting, which will provide a deeper look at the discussion among officials. ""The minutes from the May FOMC meeting should sound more hawkish on the margin than Chair Powell's press conference,"" Bank of America US economist Michael Gapen wrote in a note to clients. ""Though Powell signaled the bar for hikes is high and that standing pat is the proper response to disinflation stalling out, others on the committee were more concerned about whether policy was doing enough."" Belski's year-end target bump was followed by another forecast raise on Friday. Deutsche Bank chief equity strategist Binky Chadha boosted his year-end target for the benchmark to 5,500 from 5,100. Chadha cited robust earnings growth and an improving macroeconomic outlook as reasons stocks could keep moving higher."
Billionaire Ken Fisher Loves These 10 AI Stocks,"In this article, we will take a detailed look at Billionaire Ken Fisher Loves These 10 AI Stocks. If you want to skip our detailed analysis and see the top 5 stocks in this list, click Billionaire Ken Fisher Loves These 5 AI Stocks. Earlier this month, billionaire Ken Fisher, while talking to Bloomberg, said that in his career spanning 50 years he never spent a ""moment"" thinking or worrying about what the central banks ""might do."" Why? Because Fisher said he's ""always believed"" that ""they are just about as crazy and out of their minds as you can be."" Fisher, 73, said that the central bank management ""never"" knows what to do as it's reactive. To drive this point home, Fisher reminded everyone that just a month before the Fed's first 75bps rate hike, Fed Chair Jerome Powell had said that he was not even ""thinking about"" raising rates by 75bps. Ken Fisher has been bullish on the economy over the past several months. Rate hikes, the inflation storm, banking crisis and global uncertainty did not waver Fisher's belief that we will come out of this crisis unscathed. But in his latest interview Fisher voiced concerns about some of the threats he believes are not yet ""priced in."" Fisher is worried about ""big surprises"" that can impact global stocks and global GDP. Fisher said in financial markets everyone is usually worried about more or less the same things. But sometimes threats can slip through the cracks and we don’t see them coming. Ken Fisher said a classic example of this surprise is mark-to-market accounting rules implemented in 2007 which ""hugely took the mortgage problem and amplified it to write $2 trillion off of global bank balance sheets."" However, Fisher reiterated that he's bullish on the market right now. ""But whenever I am bullish I am still looking for risks."" Fisher's worries about the geopolitical chessboard stem from what he called the nuclear-armed triangle: China, India and Pakistan. Fisher said these three nations have different economies, politics and culture and they ""usually don’t like each other."" While Fisher thinks the odds of war in the region are not high, he doesn’t think such a war is ""impossible"" and fears any conflict between the nuclear powers in Asia would be ""catastrophic."" When asked about what sectors he's looking as bargains, Fisher said he wouldn’t call them ""bargains"" because ""valuations don’t usually tell you much about short to intermediate term stock price direction."" Instead, Fisher is looking for sectors that would do ""pretty well"" in a moderate growth economy with a ""slowly decelerating inflation"" environment."""
Retail Earnings Loom: What to Expect,"Walmart WMT shares held their own in last month’s market weakness, cementing its anchoring and defensive positioning, particularly relative to Target TGT and Home Depot HD. From the market’s March 28th peak through the end of April 2024, the S&P 500 index lost -3.8% of its value, while Walmart was down only -1.4%. Target lost -9.2% of its value during that same period, while Home Depot shares were down -12.9%. Walmart’s defensive attributes reflect the retailer’s heavy grocery exposure and reputation for value. Walmart’s value orientation and well-executed digital strategy have been key to gaining grocery market share by attracting higher-income households. Walmart’s growing share of higher-income grocery spending notwithstanding, the retailer still has a substantial exposure to lower-income consumers, who appear to be under increasing stress, as reflected in rising loan delinquency rates and other measures indicating strained financial health. This exposure could be a source of vulnerability for Walmart’s same-store sales in its quarterly release on Thursday, May 16th; Target reports the following week on May 22nd. Walmart is expected to report $0.52 in EPS on $159.2 billion in revenues, representing year-over-year changes of +6.1% and +4.5%, respectively. Trends in Walmart’s non-grocery business have been anemic lately, so any favorable turn in the demand trends for this relatively discretionary merchandise will be a nice offset to the aforementioned lower-income vulnerability. Any signs of life on the discretionary merchandise part will also have positive read-throughs for Target and Home Depot. Home Depot reports on Tuesday, May 14th. The chart below shows the one-year performance of Walmart, Home Depot, and Target relative to the S&P 500 index.   Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Target shares were up big following each of the preceding two reports, which assured investors about management’s ability on the margins and the ‘shrinkage issue’ they appeared to be struggling with over the last couple of years. Home Depot is a housing play and, as such, remains exposed to the seemingly higher-for-longer interest rate backdrop. With respect to the Retail sector 2024 Q1 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 21 of the 34 retailers in the S&P 500 index. Regular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, unlike the placement of the space in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard & Poor’s standard industry classification."
"Google, Apple, and Microsoft make their products friendlier to users with disabilities","It’s Global Accessibility Awareness Day today, and Big Tech firms have accordingly issued a flurry of announcements about how they’ll make their products friendlier to people whose use of devices is hindered by disabilities. Most coverage of Google’s I/O developer event this week may have focused on its generative AI news, but the company also announced an expansion of Project Gameface to the Android platform. Google announced that project last year—it’s an open-source, hands-free gaming “mouse” that uses the webcam to capture the gamer’s head movements and facial gestures, translating them into cursor movements via the magic of machine learning. Now Google is open-sourcing more of the code so developers can make better Android accessibility apps. Gaming may have been the inspiration for Project Gameface—specifically, the needs of a gaming streamer named Lance Carr, who has muscular dystrophy—but the applications clearly go far beyond, with Google promising use cases in educational and work settings too. In a similar vein, Apple yesterday also announced an upcoming iPhone and iPad feature called Eye Tracking. This does what the name suggests, giving users a way to navigate through and activate the elements of an app, just by letting the front-facing camera track their eye movements. Apple also revealed other accessibility features that will be coming soon: Music Haptics, which will help deaf or hard-of-hearing iPhone users experience music with the aid of “taps, textures, and refined vibrations”; Vocal Shortcuts, which will let users trigger complex tasks by uttering simple sounds; and a bunch of new accessibility features specific to the CarPlay and visionOS environments. Meanwhile, on the intriguing-hardware front, we have Microsoft’s announcement yesterday of the Proteus controller for Xbox and PC gamers. Designed by peripherals startup ByoWave, the Proteus is a kit comprising “snap and play” parts that let people customize a wireless controller according to their needs. There’s a “mother cube” that serves as the controller’s brain, a cube features the directional pad, a piece with a mini control stick, another two providing left and right triggers, and so on. There are many possible configurations, from traditional controller layouts to wand-like columns and tabletop-friendly rectangles. Preorders are open now, with the kit ($255 to first-comers, $299 thereafter) shipping in the fall. Microsoft also used the occasion of Global Accessibility Awareness Day to promise fixes for what some gamers with disabilities experienced from a major change that the company made last November when it started blocking the use of unauthorized accessories with the Xbox console. This has been an issue for those who had put together custom controller setups to fit their unique requirements, with equipment coming from small specialist manufacturers that aren’t official Microsoft licensees. Part of Microsoft’s solution is for those manufacturers to get in touch and make their controllers official, but the company is also updating its own Adaptive Controller, which the Xbox always accepts, to expand support for more accessories. The $99 Adaptive Controller is a clever piece of gear that includes some built-in controller functionality of its own, but more importantly acts as a hub for specialized equipment, such as switches that are controlled by biting, sipping, and puffing with the mouth, or with one's feet. “We appreciate and acknowledge that gaming with a disability is highly individualistic, and the solution for one may not be the solution for all,” the company said."
"Facebook, Instagram in EU crosshairs for suspected tech rule breaches","By Foo Yun Chee BRUSSELS, April 30 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms' Facebook and Instagram have failed to tackle deceptive advertising and disinformation ahead of key European Parliament elections, the European Commission said on Tuesday as it opened an investigation into suspected breaches of EU online content rules. The move by EU tech regulators came amid concerns about Russia, China and Iran as potential sources of disinformation, but also inside the EU, with some political parties and organisations seeking to attract voters with lies in the June 6-9 vote to select the next five-year parliament. The Digital Services Act which kicked in last year requires Big Tech to do more to counter illegal and harmful content on their platforms. ""We suspect that Meta's moderation is insufficient, that it lacks transparency of advertisements and content moderation procedures,"" EU digital chief Margrethe Vestager said in a statement. ""So today, we have opened proceedings against Meta to assess their compliance with the Digital Services Act,"" she said. The Commission said it suspects that Meta does not comply with DSA obligations related to addressing the dissemination of deceptive advertisements, disinformation campaigns and coordinated inauthentic behaviour in the EU. It also singled out the non-availability of an effective third-party realtime civic discourse and election-monitoring tool ahead of the elections to the European Parliament. The Commission also cited concerns about Meta's deprecation of its disinformation tracking CrowdTangle without an adequate replacement. Meta has five working days to inform the EU about remedial actions taken to address the concerns. DSA breaches can cost companies fines of as much 6% of their global annual turnover.

Microsoft debuts new Copilot+ PCs using OpenAI's GPT-4o while taking shots at Apple,"Microsoft (MSFT) is going all in on AI for the PC. The company on Monday announced a new category of PCs called Copilot+ PCs, a new variety of computers equipped with so-called AI PC chips and running Microsoft's latest version of Windows 11 and its Copilot AI software. Microsoft also revealed that its Copilot+ PCs will now run on OpenAI's GPT-4o model, allowing the assistant to interact with your PC via text, video, and voice. Users will also be able to share their screen with Copilot and have a natural conversation with the app. ""The richest AI experiences will harness the power of the cloud and the edge working together in concert. This in turn will lead to a new category of devices that turn the world itself into a prompt,"" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said on Monday. ""For us, this vision starts with our most beloved and most widely used canvas: Windows."" Microsoft's new PC push comes as the PC market enters the early innings of a turnaround after two years of declines. According to IDC, PC shipments grew 1.5% in the first quarter, compared to a 28.7% decline during the same time in 2023. Yusuf Mehdi, Microsoft executive vice president and consumer chief marketing officer, said the company expects over 50 million AI PCs to be purchased over the next year. Copilot+ PCs are an offshoot of AI PCs, which are generally defined as PCs running on Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), and Qualcomm (QCOM) chips with built-in neural processing units, or neural engines, that can run generative AI applications locally without needing to connect to the internet. Copilot+ PCs will include 16GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage to ensure performance. In a pre-recorded demonstration of Copilot's GPT-4o integration, a user fired up the game Minecraft and asked Copilot how to craft a sword. The assistant could see what the user was doing in the game and walk him through everything he needed to do to build the item. Microsoft says it will integrate Copilot for a number of gaming apps, and because it will run on your PC's NPU rather than its GPU, it shouldn't hurt overall performance."
OpenAI considers allowing users to create AI-generated pornography,"OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is exploring whether users should be allowed to create artificial intelligence-generated pornography and other explicit content with its products. While the company stressed its ban on deepfakes would continue to apply to the adult material, campaigners suggested the proposal undermined its mission statement to produce “safe and beneficial” AI. OpenAI, which is also the developer of the DALL-E image generator, revealed it was considering letting developers and users “responsibly” create what it termed not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content through its products. OpenAI said this could include “erotica, extreme gore, slurs, and unsolicited profanity”. It said: “We’re exploring whether we can responsibly provide the ability to generate NSFW content in age-appropriate contexts … We look forward to better understanding user and societal expectations of model behaviour in this area.” The proposal was published as part of an OpenAI document discussing how it develops its AI tools. Joanne Jang, an employee at the San Francisco-based company who worked on the document, told the US news organisation NPR that OpenAI wanted to start a discussion about whether the generation of erotic text and nude images should always be banned from its products. However, she stressed that deepfakes would not be allowed. “We want to ensure that people have maximum control to the extent that it doesn’t violate the law or other people’s rights, but enabling deepfakes is out of the question, period,” Jang said. “This doesn’t mean that we are trying now to create AI porn.” However, she conceded that whether the output was considered pornography “depends on your definition”, adding: “These are the exact conversations we want to have.” Jang said there were “creative cases in which content involving sexuality or nudity is important to our users”, but this would be explored in an “age-appropriate context”. The Collins dictionary refers to erotica as “works of art that show or describe sexual activity, and which are intended to arouse sexual feelings”."
"UPDATE 1-Microsoft readies new AI model to compete with Google, OpenAI, The Information reports","(Adds details in paragraphs 2-4) May 6 (Reuters) - Microsoft is training a new, in-house AI language model large enough to compete with those from Alphabet's Google and OpenAI, the Information reported on Monday. The new model, internally referred to as MAI-1, is being overseen by recently hired Mustafa Suleyman, the Google DeepMind co-founder and former CEO of AI startup Inflection, the report said, citing two Microsoft employees with knowledge of the effort. Microsoft did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Microsoft has been setting aside large cluster of servers equipped with Nvidia's graphic processing units along with large amounts of data to improve the model, according to the report. MAI-1 will be ""far larger"" than the previous smaller, open source models Microsoft had previously trained which means it will be more expensive, the report added.

Bet on These Top 5 Technology Stocks Amid Cooling Inflation,"Wall Street witnesses a new big bull as inflation resumes a downward trend. This is evident from the latest Consumer Price Index (“CPI”) report released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which shows that U.S. consumer prices increased less than expected in April 2024.The CPI rose 0.3% over the previous month and 3.4% over the prior year in April. This indicates a deceleration from March 2024, in which CPI grew 3.5%. Economists are of the view that price pressure will be down gradually and, thus, inflation will eventually incline toward the Federal Reserve’s target of 2%. This, in turn, has raised hopes of investors regarding interest rate cuts by the Fed in September 2024.Cooling inflation has pushed the stocks to record highs. The S&P 500 index closed at $5,308.15 on Wednesday, exceeding the mark of $5,300 for the first time. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite surged 1.4%, closing at $16,742.39, whereas the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached the $40,000 milestone, closing at $39,908 yesterday.  Investors looking for growth opportunities should consider investing in technology stocks in the current scenario. The likelihood of interest rate cuts bodes well for growth-oriented tech stocks. Lower interest rates are expected to boost cash inflows, especially free cash flows in the future, which remains crucial for growth-seeking tech stocks. Free cash flows help companies in pursuing acquisitions and investments in technical advancements.Lower interest rates will reduce the cost of borrowings of the technology companies, which will likely bolster their growth prospects.In addition, lower inflation will enable enterprises to sign multi-year agreements, which, in turn, will help technology companies win several valuable deals. The growing proliferation of generative AI technology remains a major positive for the technology sector. The ability to interact with humans, respond to questions asked in various languages, generate content, classify data and perform coding on the back of large language models (LLM) are bolstering the adoption of generative AI-backed chatbots.Increasing adoption of Machine Learning, Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality devices, quantum computing and cloud computing have been contributing well to the performances of the technology companies.Growing demand for data centers, driven by the need for increasing cloud capacity to support AI-related workloads, is acting as a tailwind. Apart from his, strong momentum across customer relationship software, employee management tools, natural language processing tools, time tracking tools and cyber security software is highly benefiting the software companies.Technical advancements in Internet infrastructure and the accelerated deployment of 5G technology worldwide are tailwinds. IoT-supported industrial automation, rising PC shipment andgrowing demand for smart electric appliances, wearables, electric vehicles and drones are other positives.Given this booming scenario, it is prudent for investors to place bets on tech companies such as Alphabet GOOGL, Datadog DDOG, Garmin GRMN, Salesforce CRM and CrowdStrike CRWD for superb returns.These stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and have a Growth Score of A or B, a combination that offers the best opportunities in the growth investing space.   Image Source: Zacks Investment Research   Alphabet is benefiting from growing generative AI capabilities.

Here's Why We Think Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Might Deserve Your Attention Today,"For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away. So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it.  View our latest analysis for Microsoft  If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Microsoft managed to grow EPS by 16% per year, over three years. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up. Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. The music to the ears of Microsoft shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 41% to 45% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book. In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image. Fortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of Microsoft's future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting. Owing to the size of Microsoft, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$1.0b. This comes in at 0.03% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors. One important encouraging feature of Microsoft is that it is growing profits. If that's not enough on its own, there is also the rather notable levels of insider ownership. These two factors are a huge highlight for the company which should be a strong contender your watchlists. Still, you should learn about the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Microsoft. There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features. You can access a tailored list of companies which have demonstrated growth backed by recent insider purchases."
Google Search gets biggest overhaul in years with new generative AI features,"Google (GOOG, GOOGL) on Tuesday announced some of the biggest changes to its Search product in years, rolling out generative AI features to offer more complete and direct answers to queries. The company will roll out its generative AI updates to US users beginning today and more than a billion people worldwide by the end of the year. The announcement, as part of Google’s I/O developer conference, brings a new look to Search via its AI Overview. The feature provides a brief, AI-generated answer to searches, coupled with a series of links to the sources cited in the response. Google is also working on answering more complex answers via an update in Search Labs — which offers users the ability to test upcoming capabilities. The company says you'll be able to search for a yoga or Pilates studio in Boston that offers discounts to new members and how far it is from Beacon Hill, and Search will provide an answer without you having to perform multiple searches. It will also allow you to do things like look for meal plans for a group or put together a vacation itinerary. There is also a new video search option coming to Search Labs, which enables users to take a video and use it as a search prompt. In one example, the company says a user dealing with a problem related to a record player arm would be able to take a video of the issue, and Search would be able to provide an AI Overview explanation of the malfunction and how to address it. But don’t expect this multistep or video search to be available today. Google said it’s coming to its Search Labs soon and will only be available for English queries in the US for now. I’ve been using AI Overview, and it's been a helpful addition to Search, whether I was looking for information about obscure video games from the 1990s or about how to treat a foot injury. All of these functions come as part of Google’s effort to push generative AI across its massive ecosystem of products including Android, YouTube, Gmail, and more. Google is the world leader in search, with Statcounter indicating the company controls 91% of the market compared to rival Microsoft (MSFT) Bing’s roughly 4%."
A surging stock market may not need a catalyst — but it's getting one,"This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings With the Dow (^DJI) touching 40,000 and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq (^IXIC) near new records as well, investors might be looking for the next catalyst to continue to juice the rally. Just in time, chipmaking juggernaut Nvidia comes a-calling. The company’s report is way at the end of the regular earnings season — nearly a month after Meta’s. And Nvidia’s results have only grown in importance as the company’s value has ballooned. Its market cap is $2.3 trillion, and it’s now the third-weightiest stock in the S&P 500 behind Microsoft and Apple. In what might be termed the Nvidia-verse, a whole host of semiconductor companies that either compete with or service Nvidia rise or fall with its shares. Speaking of its shares, their performance has left the other so-called Magnificent Seven stocks in the dust this year. (I know, I know, we’re not even calling them that anymore.) But after climbing an eye-watering 240% last year, Nvidia is on its way to doubling again thus far in 2024, making it the third-best gainer in the S&P 500. (It’s behind Super Micro, another AI play, and Vistra, a power provider also riding the AI demand wave.)"
It’s time for Apple to buy—not build—its way into AI,"Raise your hand if you've heard this one before: Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans. Those 19 words—one imagines them etched in stone somewhere at Apple HQ in Cupertino, Calif.—have served as Apple's standard statement about acquisitions for years (to the point that tech reporters can recite the phrase from memory). As far as PR statements go, it's actually a pretty accurate description of Apple's approach to M&A. With the exception of 2014's still-perplexing $3 billion Beats acquisition, Apple likes to buy companies that are small and relatively low profile—typically they're the early pieces of whatever, longer-term technological puzzle Apple is quietly assembling (which could be anything from the VisionPro to its own line of in-house microprocessors). The problem for Apple is that there's only one tech puzzle to assemble that matters today: generative AI. It's a game changer, with the power to upend even the most dominant of business models. And it's too late for Apple to start putting that puzzle together on its own. Its biggest competitors, including Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Amazon, have already released AI products, while Apple is nowhere to be seen. To be a superpower in the age of AI probably requires owning a cutting-edge large language model. That's not something you can easily build from scratch—especially if you're trying to build version 1.0 and OpenAI is already about to release GPT 5.0. All of this is to say that this is not one of those ""from time to time"" moments in which Apple has the luxury to leisurely collect small AI startups here and there. If there was ever a time when Apple needed to ""think different,"" and buy its way into the market by acquiring a large company with a working product, this is it. There's plenty to choose from—Anthropic, Cohere, and Mistral, to name a few. On the video side of things, there's Runway. Just a few weeks ago, Inflection AI sold its IP to Microsoft, and much of its AI talent, including cofounder Mustafa Suleyman, joined Microsoft. How different would the landscape look right now if Apple had snagged the Inflection team? Antitrust is obviously a risk. But Apple can point to a market full of big fish like Microsoft, Google, Meta, Amazon, and Adobe. It's not as if Apple doesn't have the money. Apple ended the most recent quarter with $58 billion in net cash, and it's giving billions back to shareholders in massive buybacks and dividends. With AI about to transform the tech industry, it's stunning that one of the most innovative companies on Earth can't think of a better use for that capital."

Nvidia (NVDA) Is Up 2.89% in One Week: What You Should Know,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades. Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us. Below, we take a look at Nvidia (NVDA), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions. It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Nvidia currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).

PRESS DIGEST- Wall Street Journal - May 16,"May 16 (Reuters) - The following are the top stories in the Wall Street Journal. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy. - Microsoft is asking hundreds of employees in China to consider transferring outside the country amid a rise in tensions between Washington and Beijing around critical technology like cloud computing and artificial intelligence. - Malaysia's Axiata and conglomerate Sinar Mas are in talks to merge their telecommunications operations in Indonesia to create a combined entity with a market capitalization of about $3.6 billion. - International Business Machines is selling to Palo Alto Networks its cloud-based QRadar cybersecurity software as the two technology companies deepen their partnership in jointly selling and developing security products powered by artificial intelligence. - McDonald's is planning to sell a $5 meal bundle this summer as the fast food giant seeks to keep cost-conscious consumers, amid an increase in rivals' promotions. - Netflix said on Wednesday it would stream two National Football League games on Christmas Day this year and at least one game on Christmas day in 2025 and 2026, doubling down on efforts to add more live programming on its streaming service. - Australia-based slots and digital gaming company Aristocrat Leisure will mull a sale or spinoff of two game developers that no longer fit well in its portfolio, its chief executive said. (Compiled by Bengaluru newsroom) Microsoft is asking some of its China-based employees to consider transferring outside the country, the company said on Thursday, as relations between U.S. and China grow increasingly strained over technologies like artificial intelligence and semiconductors.  The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the news, said Microsoft is asking about 700 to 800 people who are involved in machine learning and other work related to cloud computing to consider relocating.  Microsoft remains committed to China and will continue to operate there and other markets, the spokesperson said. Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC does not necessarily need to use ASML's next generation ""High NA EUV"" machines for an upcoming generation of chip manufacturing technology called A16, which is under development for the second half of 2026, an executive said on Tuesday.  The High NA lithography tools are expected to help shrink chip designs by up to two-thirds, but chipmakers must weigh that benefit against a higher cost and whether ASML's older tech may be more reliable and good enough.  Speaking at a conference in Amsterdam, Kevin Zhang said that it is possible that the company's A16 plants could be designed to accommodate the technology, but that is not certain. AMSTERDAM (Reuters) -Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC plans to start construction of its first European facility in the fourth quarter of 2024, it said on Tuesday.  At a conference in the Netherlands, TSMC's European chief Paul de Bot said the facility in the German city of Dresden, known as European Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (ESMC), was on track for construction to begin this year with production in 2027.  Last August TSMC announced plans for the $11 billion factory in Germany, with Infineon , NXP, and Robert Bosch each taking a 10% stake."
"Instagram, YouTube the biggest likely winners of TikTok ban but smaller rivals could rise too","Adult U.S. TikTok users spend an average of 54 minutes on the app on any given day, more than Instagram, Snapchat or YouTube, according to research firm eMarketer. If TikTok were to disappear, those platforms — along with younger, smaller emerging rivals — would be scrambling for those valuable minutes of people's attention. But with an actual ban still likely years away, it's not clear what app will be its biggest beneficiary. Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, may see more advertisers amid uncertainty for its biggest rival, according to analysts who follow the company. Creators, dealing with uncertainty themselves are also expanding to other platforms if they weren’t already. But users, especially the younger ones who are TikTok’s bread and butter, are less predictable. Will they embrace Instagram, a possibly uncool mom favorite? Or could a newer app like Triller rise to viral fame? Here's a look at some notable TikTok alternatives and how they measure up. Meta has a long tradition of cloning competitive services, with varying degrees of success. The Instagram “Story” feature, which lets people share photos and videos that expire in 24 hours, is similar to Snapchat. The company also launched a TikTok knockoff called Lasso in 2018 but closed that down in 2020. Then Instagram launched Reels 2020, a TikTok-like feed of short videos users can create or scroll through. It’s proven to be massively popular. Could it replace TikTok? That depends. While many creators post on both platforms, some experts say the youngest users are unlikely to migrate to a service made popular by their millennial parents. And while Meta's algorithm is addictive, it's still not TikTok. “Replicating TikTok’s algorithm is a nearly impossible task, as rival Meta would attest to,"" said eMarketer analyst Jasmine Enberg. “TikTok’s ability to serve up relevant and entertaining content to its users is unparalleled in the social media world.” While TikTok gets more headlines, YouTube still dominates U.S. teens' attention. Roughly nine in ten teens said they use YouTube, in a recent survey by the Pew Research Center, making it the most widely used platform among the 13-17 crowd. TikTok clocked in at 63%, Snapchat at 60% and Instagram at 59%. Its parent company Google launched YouTube Shorts in 2020, shortly after India banned TikTok. YouTube users can scroll through Shorts just as they can on TikTok or Reels on Instagram and Facebook, watching hours of bite-sized videos. As with Reels, many of the videos featured are from TikTok or creators who post to several different platforms. That said, YouTube is still known for its longer-format videos, so it may not have the variety that TikTok users are looking for — at least not yet. While older adults never quite got into Snapchat, launched in 2011 with its infamous disappearing videos, it remains popular among teens and younger adults. In addition to its disappearing video feature, the company launched Snapchat Spotlight in 2020 (yes, the same year India banned TikTok and former U.S. President Donald Trump was trying to in the U.S.). The feature can be accessed by pressing the sideways triangle icon at the bottom of your screen and, at least according to Snapchat, it “shines a light on the most entertaining Snaps, no matter who created them.”"
5 Most Powerful Countries in the World by Economy,"In this article, we will look at the 5 Most Powerful Countries in the World by Economy. The United States of America, China, and Germany are some of the most powerful countries in the world by economy. Factors including strong GDP growth, low inflation rates, increased employment opportunities, and strong investment determine a country’s economic power. In addition to these factors, the overall world economic outlook also contributes to the economic performance of these countries. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) April 2024 update, the world economy grew at 3.2% in 2023 and is forecasted to continue growing at the same rate in 2024 and 2025. The advanced economies of the world are expected to witness a slight increase in growth rate and are forecasted to grow at 1.7% in 2024 as compared to a 1.6% growth rate in 2023. On the other hand, growth for emerging and developing economies is expected to slow down modestly from 4.3% in 2023 to 4.2% in 2024. Global headline inflation is easing and was close to the pre-pandemic level in late 2023 for most economies. During the last quarter of 2023, headline inflation was recorded to be 2.3% down from 9.5% in the second quarter of 2022 in a quarter-wise analysis. While headline inflation for emerging and developing countries has also cooled down from its peak of 13.7% in the first quarter of 2022, it is still considerably high and was recorded at 9.9% in the last quarter of 2023. The mean inflation rate for developing countries is high due to uncontrolled inflation in some countries. For instance, on May 3rd, Reuters reported that annual consumer price inflation in Turkey climbed up by 69.8% in April, the rise was still below expectations, however, it was the highest since late 2022. The Finance Minister of Turkey, Mehmet Simsek, said that though inflation will peak in May, it will start to ease sharply to be in line with the government's prediction.

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Saudi Arabian Oil Company (TADAWUL:2222) are two of the leading companies leading the global economy. Let's discuss some updates from them. On May 8th, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced $3.3 billion in Wisconsin to strengthen artificial intelligence economic activity, innovation, and job creation. The investment package is designed to upgrade Southeast Wisconsin as a hub of cloud computing, and will also lead to the building of the country's first manufacturing-focused Artificial innovation lab. Moreover, the initiative also aims to address the skill gap within the state and will help equip over 100,000 residents with essential AI skills. The president of the United States, Joe Biden along with the president of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Brad Smith announced this new investment package at Gateway Technical College. Saudi Arabian Oil Company (TADAWUL:2222) is an integrated energy and chemical company based in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia with operations running internationally. The company operates in the upstream and downstream segments and deals with the exploration, development, and production, of hydrocarbon products, and other related chemicals. On April 27th Saudi Arabian Oil Company (TADAWUL:2222) announced that it is exploring a joint venture in its Saudi Aramco Jubail Refinery Company with its Chinese partner Rongsheng Petrochemical Co., Ltd. (SHE:002493) as a new downstream partner. Saudi Arabian Oil Company (TADAWUL:2222) recently signed a cooperation framework agreement that envisions Rongsheng Petrochemical Co., Ltd. (SHE:002493) acquiring 50% of the stake in the Saudi Aramco Jubail Refinery Company. The agreement also lays the foundation for the development of liquid-to-chemical expansion projects at the refinery. The Aramco Downstream President, Mohammed Y. Al Qahtani, said that this partnership is a step towards key geographical expansions and to attract investment in the Saudi downstream sector. With that, let’s look at some of the most powerful countries in the world by economy. 5 Most Powerful Countries in the World by Economy Our Methodology To create the list of 5 most powerful countries in the world by economy, we relied on four main economic indicators including GDP at current prices, real GDP growth rates, GDP per capita (PPP), and GDP per capita growth rates, all sourced from IMF. We used the GDP at current prices as our primary metric to rank the countries. GDP is one of the most commonly used single measures to gauge a country’s overall economic activity and represent the total value of all the final goods and services produced within a country during a year. We have used recent data for 2024 for all of our indicators. The list is arranged in ascending order of countries' GDP."
Does Reddit's (RDDT) OpenAI Partnership Make It Worth Buying?,"Reddit RDDT shares jumped 11.74% in after-hours trading on May 16, following the announcement of its partnership with Microsoft MSFT-backed OpenAI.The deal will bring Reddit content to OpenAI’s ChatGPT and other products and, at the same time, will help the social media company incorporate new AI-powered features into its forums. OpenAI will also become Reddit’s advertising partner.Since its initial public offering in March, Reddit shares have gained 22.6%, outperforming the Zacks Internet Software industry and the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector. Reddit’s huge data trove makes it an invaluable source for big techs like Alphabet GOOGL division Google, Amazon AMZN and Microsoft for training their large language models (LLMs). LLMs form the base of Generative AI applications.Generative AI and AI-related startups like OpenAI have attracted close to $50 billion in investments since 2023, affirming the growing interest in the technology and its applications. Microsoft invested close to $13 billion in OpenAI as it sought to gain a front seat in the startup’s AI innovations. Another startup, Anthropic, raised close to $2 billion and $4 billion from investors led by Alphabet’s division Google and Amazon, respectively, as it sought a valuation of close to $30 billion.OpenAI’s GPT-4, Anthropic’s Claude 3 Opus, and Google DeepMind’s Gemini Ultra are the three most capable tools currently available in the Generative AI domain. Reddit Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Reddit Inc. Quote   However, OpenAI and Anthropic are facing increasing competition from their original backers — Microsoft, Amazon and Google, respectively — as these big techs plan to build their own LLMs primarily because these are cheaper to build in-house and they can exercise more control on how to use the models. The OpenAI deal is expected to give them a glimpse of the potency of RDDT’s data in training their models.Reddit’s partnership with Google, which involves training the latter’s LLMs, has been a game changer. An expanded partnership in February this year made it easier for users to find, discover and engage in content and communities on Reddit that are most relevant to them.RDDT is already benefiting from growing data licensing deals as other revenues surged more than 450% year over year to $20 million in the first quarter of 2024. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s prospects are supported by strong ad revenue growth expectations driven by an expanding user base. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Reddit currently has a Zacks Momentum Score of A, which makes it further attractive. Google is playing an important role in expanding its user base as it is getting better at displaying RDDT’s content. In first-quarter 2024, Daily Active Uniques (“DAUq”) increased 37% year over year to 82.7 million. Logged-in DAUq: Global, which RDDT considers as the core metrics of the business, jumped 27% year over year to 43.1 million in the reported quarter.Reddit’s focus on making the platform faster and more user-friendly is noteworthy. It continues to invest in AI and machine learning to improve relevance, engagement and moderation. RDDT plans to deploy its own trained LLMs to improve moderation. These initiatives are expected to drive user engagement.Reddit’s plan to monetize its platform through the launch of a revamped version of user awards and Reddit Gold (its virtual currency) bodes well for its future prospects.Its focus on reducing campaign setup time for self-serve and small and medium businesses (SMBs), as well as the launch of free formats, which provide advertisers with a versatile and creative format to drive deeper engagement with users, is expected to drive ad revenues.Reddit Pro, a free suite of AI-powered insights and tools, is currently in beta with more than 1000 businesses, including Taco Bell, Wendy’s, NFL, the Wall Street Journal, as well as several SMBs. Shopping also remains on the horizon, with RDDT launching shopping ads and testing dynamic product ads. Reddit’s user-friendly and advertiser-friendly focus is a key catalyst. Upcoming user interface improvements, better on-platform search capabilities and monetization plans provide strong growth opportunities. RDDT plans to grow revenues twice as fast as cost growth over the long term, which surely makes the stock attractive for investors at its current level.

"With Apple entering the fight, the AI chip wars have gone nuclear","The artificial intelligence (AI) chip wars have officially kicked into high gear. On Tuesday, Apple (AAPL) unveiled its latest iPad Pro lineup, complete with the company’s all-new M4 chip. The processor, Apple says, features a 50% faster CPU than the prior generation Pro’s M2 chip, as well as a GPU with four times the performance of its predecessor. But Apple focused most on the M4’s neural engine, the portion of the chip dedicated to running AI applications. According to the company, the neural engine in the M4 is the company’s fastest yet, and it's more powerful than any neural processing unit available on today’s AI PCs. That might all seem like Apple puffing out its chest at the competition, and it is to a degree. But it also shows we’re entering a new era of PC marketing focused on the promise of generative AI applications running directly on our machines, rather than in the cloud. Microsoft (MSFT) is already pushing the category of AI PCs along with Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), Qualcomm (QCOM), and Nvidia (NVDA), and with Apple entering the fray, the battle over which company is the new AI champ has officially begun. The AI PC, or in the case of Apple AI iPad or AI Mac, is meant to be able to run smaller versions of the kinds of large language models that power apps like ChatGPT, Microsoft’s Copilot, and Google’s Gemini. In fact, Google (GOOG, GOOGL) already runs a version of its Gemini model called Gemini Nano on its Pixel smartphones. AI PCs are, generally, PCs that include neural processing units (NPUs), or in Apple’s case, a neural engine. These are essentially portions of a chip dedicated to powering AI applications. Intel’s Core Ultra chips, which it debuted in December, feature their own NPUs, while AMD has been showing off chips with its XDNA AI engine since May 2023. Qualcomm, for its part, has also joined the fight with its Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus chips. All of these chips should end up in Windows PCs on store shelves by the end of the year. Microsoft is already banking on AI PCs being a runaway success, going so far as to introduce a Windows keyboard button dedicated to its AI-powered Copilot software. It’s the first new keyboard button in nearly 30 years. Apple, on the other hand, has been building its neural engine into its chips since it launched its A11 processor in the iPhone X in 2017. The company has regularly touted its neural engine’s capabilities throughout the years, but the debut of the M4 chip marked the first time Apple started throwing out key performance metrics. During its press event unveiling the M4, Apple was sure to point out that it not only has been outfitting its chips with neural processing engines for years but that the M4 is capable of running 38 trillion operations per second (TOPS). TOPS is more or less a measurement of how well a chip can handle AI tasks. Qualcomm, for its part, says that its Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus chips offer 45 TOPS of performance. And according to CNET, Intel and AMD’s chips top out at 34 and 38 TOPS, respectively."
11 stocks that mattered most this earnings season,"The S&P 500 (^GSPC) is wrapping up its two busiest weeks of earnings reports this quarter, with more than half of the index reporting results. Companies have largely surprised to the upside, with the index pacing at earnings growth of 5.5% this quarter, per Evercore ISI. Stock reactions have been mixed, though, as the prospect of interest rates remaining high for longer than expected hangs over markets and many companies struggle to impress investors given the market's roaring rally going into the reporting period.  Below we break down some of the key companies that have reported this season. Tesla (TSLA) stock rose more than 10% on the day following its earnings report despite the company missing Wall Street's expectations for both revenue and earnings per share in the prior quarter. Instead of a fundamentals story, CEO Elon Musk caught investor attention with an announcement that the company would accelerate its launch of a low-cost vehicle. Musk also emphasized the company's role in the AI world, highlighting that the company will be a leader in autonomous ridesharing.  Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) stock soared more than 10% after the company announced its first-ever cash dividend of $0.20 per share. The board of directors also approved stock repurchases of up to an additional $70 billion. The company's market cap surpassed $2 trillion following the report. The Facebook parent company had a different earnings reaction than its tech counterparts. The stock fell more than 10% after the midpoint of its current quarter revenue guidance range came in light compared to the Street's expectations. Spending was also a key concern among investors, as Meta (META) said it expects the company's full-year total expenses to come in between $96 billion and $99 billion, up from a range of $94 billion to $99 billion due to higher infrastructure and legal costs. Across all of Big Tech, spending was a large focus of quarterly reports as companies announced plans to increase capital expenditures amid the AI spending rush."
Google Parent Alphabet Eyes HubSpot Acquisition: Bloomberg,"Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Google’s parent company, is in advanced discussions to acquire marketing software provider HubSpot Inc. (NYSE:HUBS), Bloomberg reports. While discussions continue, no definitive agreement has been reached. The possibility of another interested buyer entering the scene remains, indicating a level of uncertainty surrounding the potential acquisition, Both Alphabet and HubSpot have refrained from commenting on the matter, Bloomberg said. HubSpot’s shares surged by approximately 32% over the past year, elevating its market capitalization to $30 billion. The stock witnessed a notable uptick, climbing up to 6% during premarket trading on Thursday. HubSpot aims to deliver seamless connection for customer-facing teams on its platform, which includes AI-powered engagement hubs, a Smart CRM, and a connected ecosystem with over 1,500 App Marketplace integrations. The company reported a first-quarter FY24 revenue of $617.4 million, a 23% increase compared to first-quarter FY23. Subscription revenue which makes up a large part, gained 23% to $603.8 million. The company anticipates full-year 2024 revenue of $2.55 billion to $2.56 billion. As of Mar. 31, HubSpot had $447.79 million in cash and equivalents. An acquisition of HubSpot by Alphabet would represent a significant move, potentially positioning Alphabet to enhance its competitiveness in the customer relationship management (CRM) sector, particularly targeting smaller businesses. This move could help Alphabet better compete with major CRM players like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL), and Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM), according to Bloomberg."

Mailik calls the investment shots for the money-managing giant, which boasts $1.2 trillion in assets under management. Suffice to say, she wasn't on board with my 5% CD or Akiko's high-yield savings account. In effect, we are part of the crowd making one of the biggest investing mistakes Mailik continues to see as she travels the world to communicate with investors. ""Cash on the sidelines [is one of the biggest mistakes], Malik said. ""Studies have shown that when you market time, you lose money relative to if you just stayed invested. This started last year as everyone expected a recession to come. They are holding their cash and 5% returns."" ""Nothing wrong with 5% returns, but when the market is up, multiples of that and even fixed-income markets have yields that are higher than that today, [so] you're losing relative money.

Is Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) The Best Jim Cramer Stock to Buy Now?,"Jim Cramer has been recommending Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) for long-term investors as Amazon.com Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS business continues to shine.

"US stocks rangebound ahead of more key earnings, Fed minutes, speakers","Investing.com -- U.S. stocks traded in tight ranges Monday, with investors cautious ahead of more cues on interest rates and earnings this week. At 09:35 ET (13:35 GMT), Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 16 points, or 0.1%, while S&P 500 rose 5 points, or 0.1%, and NASDAQ Composite rose 50 points, or 0.3%. The focus this week is squarely on more cues from the Federal Reserve on the future path of interest rates, with the minutes of the central bank’s late-April meeting due on Wednesday. Fed officials had kept rates steady at that meeting and warned that they needed more confidence that inflation was coming down. But Fed Chair Jerome Powell had also said that rates were eventually expected to come down in 2024. Several Fed officials are also set to speak this week, with particular focus on the members of the Fed’s rate-setting committee. The Fed cues come amid increased focus on the bank’s plans to cut interest rates, especially after slightly softer inflation readings for April pushed up hopes for a September rate cut. Beyond more cues on interest rates, markets were also awaiting purchasing managers index data for May, which is set to offer more cues on U.S. business activity. Any signs of cooling could factor into the outlook for interest rate cuts. Wall Street indexes made new highs last week, but they were seen running out of momentum amid uncertainty over just when the Fed could begin trimming rates. Overheated valuations, particularly in the technology sector, and cooling hype over artificial intelligence also limited just how high indexes could push. Focus this week was also on quarterly earnings from AI darling Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), to see whether the firm could justify a massive increase in valuation over the past year."
iPad Pro M4 review: ludicrously good hardware that’s total overkill for most,"Apple’s latest iPad Pro is thinner and lighter, and has a stupendous new OLED screen, plus oodles of power to do practically anything. But it is no longer just the super-premium iPad – it is also aiming to be an impressive tool for the creative industry. It still looks and acts like an iPad, ready to do regular iPad things such as browse the web, watch TV or chat to your family on the other side of the country. But to do only that with a machine this advanced is total overkill – Apple has many other iPad models suited to that sort of thing. This serious tablet comes with a serious price tag. The smaller 11in version starts at £999 (€1,119/$999/A$1,699), while the 13in model costs from £1,299 (€1,549/$1,299/A$2,199). That’s already laptop money without including accessories such as a keyboard or stylus. Unlike previous generations of the iPad Pro, the 11in and 13in have the same new screen technology, making the smaller model as reviewed more tempting. It essentially has two OLED screens layered on top of each other to produce an extremely high full-screen brightness of up to 1,000nits, and a peak of 1,600nits in super-bright spots in HDR content. For reference, other iPads top out at 600nits, while many competitor tablets, laptops or monitors barely reach 400nits. It runs at up to 120Hz, making it super-smooth in operation, and has incredible contrast similar to high-end OLED displays on phones or TVs. Blacks are truly black, whites are super-bright, and it is spectacularly colourful and accurate. It surpasses the already excellent previous generation, and will be the best screen in almost everyone’s house. For those likely to need absolute colour accuracy, such as those in the film industry, Apple also offers a special reference mode in settings, and sells an antiglare nano texture screen coating, similar to its professional monitors. The tablet is extremely thin at 5.3mm thick or less, and is now lighter by up to 103g depending on the model. You will need a case to keep it safe, and you will need to be more careful with it than you might a cheaper, bulkier tablet. The Face ID selfie camera is now in the right place for video calls in landscape, which is much better. Screen: 11in or 13in Ultra Liquid Retina XDR display (264 pixels an inch) Processor: Apple M4 (9/10-core CPU+10-core GPU) RAM: 8 or 16GB"
Microsoft offers cloud customers AMD alternative to Nvidia AI processors,"By Max A. Cherney SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Microsoft said on Thursday it plans to offer its cloud computing customers a platform of AMD artificial intelligence chips that will compete with components made by Nvidia, with details to be given at its Build developer conference next week. It will also launch a preview of new Cobalt 100 custom processors at the conference. Microsoft's clusters of Advanced Micro Devices' flagship MI300X AI chips will be sold through its Azure cloud computing service. They will give its customers an alternative to Nvidia's H100 family of powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) which dominate the data center chip market for AI but can be hard to obtain due to high demand. To build AI models or run applications, companies typically must string together - or cluster - multiple GPUs because the data and computation will not fit on a single processor. AMD, which expects $4 billion in AI chip revenue this year, has said the chips are powerful enough to train and run large AI models. As well as Nvidia's top-shelf AI chips, Microsoft's cloud computing unit sells access to its own in-house AI chips called Maia. Separately, the Cobalt 100 processors Microsoft plans to preview next week offer 40% better performance over other processors based on Arm Holdings' technology, the company said. Snowflake and others have begun to use them. The Cobalt chips, which were announced in November, are being tested to power Teams, Microsoft's messaging tool for businesses, and positioned to compete with the in-house Graviton CPUs made by Amazon.com. Amazon said this week that social network Pinterest and fintech firm Robinhood Markets have started using its Graviton chips."
British grocer Sainsbury's partners with Microsoft to use AI for data insights,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Sainsbury's said on Friday it has agreed a five-year strategic partnership with Microsoft that will use the technology company's artificial intelligence capabilities and the supermarket group's rich data. Seeking revenue gains and cost savings, more retailers are using generative AI to boost personalised shopping experiences for consumers and make staff working practices more efficient. Sainsbury's, Britain's second-largest grocer after Tesco, said it would use AI to create a more interactive shopping experience for online shoppers, while also improving search functions. In stores, staff would have real-time data and insights for key processes, such as shelf replenishment. Time to market for new services and product innovations would also be reduced, Sainsbury's said. No financial details of the partnership were disclosed. Sainsbury's in February updated the market on its strategy, setting a new cost-savings target of 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion) over three years and pledging to boost returns for shareholders. Last month, it forecast up to 10% growth in profit in the current financial year that began on March 3, confident it can continue to win more customers from rivals.

Tanking Profit Overshadowed Alibaba's AI Growth And Reignited Domestic E-Commerce,"On Tuesday, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA) reported its net profit took quite a dive during the fiscal fourth quarter, after already having a hard time throughout 2023 as it underwent its largest-ever corporate restructuring. For the quarter ended on March 31st, Alibaba posted revenue grew 7% YoY to 221.9 billion yuan, which amounts $30.7 billion, as it boosted domestic e-commerce sales. But, Alibaba reported its net income attributable to ordinary shareholders tanked as much as 86% YoY to 3.27 billion yuan, which is about $452 million, attributing the poor result to a net loss from investments in publicly-traded companies, compared to last year’s quarter when it made a net gain. Early signs of reignited e-commerce growth. Although Alibaba is still grappling with cautious consumers in China amid the economic slowdown, its core e-commerce business has improved due to its focus on low-cost goods. Taobao and Tmall division that represent its e-commerce segment reported 4% YoY growth to 93.2 billion yuan, accelerating from previous quarter’s 2% growth. Customer management revenue which consists of sales received from services such as marketing that merchants get from Alibaba, reported 5% YoY growth, also improving from being flat in the previous quarter. International commerce business grew 45% YoY 27.4 billion yuan. Cloud growth fails to impress, but AI rose to the task. The cloud computing division is having a hard time to shine. Last year, Alibaba decided not proceed with the spinoff of the division that competes with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) AWS and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL)-owned Google Cloud. For the reported quarter, Cloud computing brought in 25.6 billion yuan to the revenue table, posting the same growth rate of 3% YoY from the previous quarter. However, AI-related revenue reported a triple-digit YoY growth. AI-revenue came from various sectors, including foundational model companies, internet companies, financial services and the automotive industry. On Monday, Microsoft-backed OpenAI launched its new AI model, GPT-4o. Through a livestreamed event, Microsoft-backed OpenAI demonstrated its latest effort of expanding the use of its chatbot and improving its capabilities as it made a significant step when it comes to ease of use. Microsoft-backed Open AI demonstrated the capabilities of the new model that is able to even perceive the user’s emotion, help calm a user down before making a public speech as well as read a story in a different tone or even sing it. OpenAI also touted the fact the new model can act as a translator even in audio mode. Moreover, by solving math equations and helping to write codes, GPT-4o  is a strong contender to Microsoft-made GitHub Copilot. All in all, Alibaba did report its profit plummeted, but its core business as well as the promising AI segment are growing, both of which are the main heroes of its storyline and future prospects."
"Another streaming bundle: Comcast's Peacock to partner with Netflix, Apple TV+","Consumers will soon have access to yet another streaming bundle. Comcast (CMCSA) CEO Brian Roberts said early Tuesday that later this month, the company will launch a new offering that combines its Peacock platform, Netflix (NFLX), and Apple TV+ (AAPL). The new bundle, referred to as StreamSaver, will be available to customers of Comcast’s broadband internet service, the executive revealed at a MoffettNathanson conference. ""Those three products will come at a vastly reduced price to anything in the market today and be available to all our customers,"" Roberts said. Exact pricing details will be announced at a later date. ""We've been bundling video successfully and creatively for 60 years,"" he added. ""This is the latest iteration of that, and I think this will be a pretty compelling package."" The developments come as media companies face pressure from investors to scale their streaming services and achieve profitability. At the same time, the companies are dealing with more competition from tech giants like Amazon (AMZN) and YouTube (GOOGL, GOOG), which are gobbling up streaming deals. On average, US consumers subscribe to four streaming services and spend about $61 per month on them, according to the latest Digital Media Trends report from Deloitte. That means fewer opportunities for streamers to retain loyal subscribers over time. The concept of bundling isn't new. Companies in the space have been doing it with their own services for years. Apple, for instance, offers Apple One, which combines Apple TV+ with other services like Apple Music and Apple Arcade. The bundle launched globally in late 2020. Disney, which has also been offering a bundle with Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+, officially began its domestic rollout of a one-app experience late last year that incorporates Hulu content via Disney+ — a similar play to Paramount's Showtime combination as well as the integration of HBO Max and Discovery+, which both merged their respective services last year. The move toward partnerships among competing media companies, though, has gained traction recently. Just last week, Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) and Disney (DIS) announced a new streaming bundle that will bring together Disney+, Hulu, and Max streaming services, with a launch date set for this summer in the US."
4 Semiconductor Stocks in Focus as Sales Make a Rebound,"The semiconductor industry is trying to stage a comeback. Sales are steadily increasing and the picture is far better than it was in 2023. Rebounding demand is driving sales and analysts believe that the industry has a lot of potential left. The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) said on May 7 that global semiconductor sales totaled $137.7 billion during the first quarter of 2024, increasing 15.2% year over year. However, sales fell 5.7% from the fourth quarter of 2023. The SIA said that the decline is temporary and sales are expected to grow at a faster pace in the coming months. According to SIA president and CEO John Neuffer, “First-quarter global semiconductor sales were significantly higher than the total from the first quarter of last year, but sales slipped somewhat on a month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter basis, reflecting normal seasonal trends.” The semiconductor industry had a dream run during the peak of the pandemic as millions worked from home, leading to a surge in demand for communication devices and other gadgets. However, price pressures, owing to high interest rates as the Federal Reserve adopted an aggressive monetary tightening policy to curb sky-high inflation, dried up demand. With inflation showing signs of easing in 2023, demand started rebounding, driving sales. The SIA predicts semiconductor sales to grow double digits for the rest of 2024 as price pressures ease further. Moreover, the continued excitement surrounding artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI, is expected to drive semiconductor sales in the near term. Experts believe that AI holds significant potential, with much yet to be witnessed by the world. This is going to drive demand even further as an increasing number of tech companies are exploring the avenue. Given the promising future, it would be wise to invest in semiconductor stocks like NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, Micron Technology, Inc. MU, NXP Semiconductors NXPI and Texas Instruments TXN, from which investors can gain in the near term. Each of these stocks has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and assures good returns. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. NVIDIA Corporation is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. Over the years, NVDA’s focus has evolved from PC graphics to AI-based solutions that now support high-performance computing, gaming and virtual reality platforms."
25 Careers with the Most Job Security in the US,"In this article, we will look at the 25 careers with the most job security in the US. We have also talked about growing concerns about job insecurity due to AI. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 10 Careers with the Most Job Security in the US. According to a study conducted by Authority Hacker, with a sample of 1200 full-time workers, job insecurity looms large over the American workforce as over half of full-time employees express growing concerns. Strikingly, the tech industry which is largely believed to be synonymous with innovation, is witnessing an increase in anxiety, attributed to recurrent mass layoffs and the specter of AI replacing human roles. According to the survey, men exhibit a higher propensity for job insecurity compared to women, with those earning $150,000 or more exhibiting the highest concern. Moreover, professions most vulnerable to AI disruption such as IT, software development, and advertising, report the most severe cases of anxieties. It is also interesting to note that one of the most vulnerable jobs to AI are that of customer service representatives which are also known to have the most oversaturated jobs. Apart from concerns of job insecurity due to AI, job insecurity has been a persistent concern, especially during economic downturns in the US. Despite claims that recessions have become less common over time, skepticism remains due to historical data discrepancies. According to Business Insider, between 1990 and 2023, the US experienced 36 months of recession, compared to 59 months between 1960 and 1989. However, the reliability of recession data before 1950 is questionable which potentially skewes perceptions of historical recession frequency. Speaking of economic downturns, in April 2024, the US observed a major slowdown in job growth as employers only added 175,000 positions. This trend was accompanied by a rise in the unemployment rate from 3.8% to 3.9%, according to the Labor Department. The Federal Reserve's decision to increase interest rates since 2022 also aimed to temper economic expansion and alleviate inflationary pressures. However, with inflation remaining above the bank's 2% target at 3.5% in March, there were doubts about the timing of further rate cuts. Nonetheless, the unexpected slowdown in job growth in April raised expectations for potential rate adjustments later in the year. Despite the tempered job growth, some sectors like healthcare, continued to drive employment gains. Average hourly earnings rose by 3.9% over the 12 months to April, albeit at a slower pace compared to the previous month. Now that we are talking about job gains, it is worth highlighting that Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is set to construct an $800 million data center spanning 715,000 square feet in Montgomery, Alabama. This data center is anticipated to generate 100 job opportunities. Located near the Interstate 65 and Hyundai's automotive assembly plant, the site was announced by Governor Kay Ivey at Montgomery Whitewater and is slated for completion by 2026. Over 1,000 construction workers are expected to be engaged at the peak of its construction. This is one of the most significant investments by Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) in Alabama, following the establishment of its first data center campus in Huntsville in 2021, which currently employs approximately 300 individuals. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)’s total investment in the state amounts to $1.5 billion. Montgomery will become home to Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)’s 24th data hub and its 20th in the United States. The city was selected owing to its accessibility to infrastructure, renewable energy availability, and a rich pool of talent. Once operational, the facility is slated to achieve LEED Gold certification, utilize 100% renewable energy, and attain net-zero emissions. On the other hand, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services (AWS) has announced a monumental investment of $11 billion in Indiana which is expected to generate a minimum of 1,000 job opportunities. With the backing of Governor Eric Holcomb and the Indiana Economic Development Corporation (IEDC), Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) will establish new data centers in St. Joseph County to fortify infrastructure and economic growth in the region. Since 2010, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has invested $21.5 billion in Indiana and hence, has contributed largely to the state's gross domestic product and created over 26,000 full- and part-time positions."
10 Most Promising Stocks to Buy Before They Take Off,"In this article, we discuss the 10 most promising stocks to buy before they take off. To skip the detailed analysis of the current earnings week, go directly to the 5 Most Promising Stocks to Buy Before They Take Off. The market started the week on a positive note, showing an upward trajectory on April 22 and 23. However, there was a slight temporary dip in the market, especially for tech stocks after Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) provided a disappointing outlook despite better-than-expected earnings. On April 24, the company reported Q1 2024 GAAP EPS of $4.71, ahead of consensus estimates by $0.39, and the revenue of $36.46 billion was up over 27% year-over-year and outperformed the forecasts by $240 million. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) provided weak outlook, showing increased expenses for the year and revenue expectations for the second quarter below analyst estimates. The company anticipates full-year 2024 capital expenditures to be between $35-40 billion, up from the prior guidance of $30-37 billion, and expects revenue of $36.5-39 billion in the second quarter. In addition, Meta Platforms, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:META) metaverse division, Reality Labs continues to lose cash and reported losses of $3.85 billion on a $440 million revenue. Nevertheless, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) mentioned some positives too about its AI offerings at its latest earnings call. The CEO, Mark Zuckerberg said: “We're building a number of different AI services, from Meta AI, our AI assistant that you can ask any question across our apps and glasses, to creator AIs that help creators engage their communities and that fans can interact with, to business AIs that we think every business eventually on our platform will use to help customers buy things and get customer support, to internal coding and development AIs, to hardware like glasses for people to interact with AIs, and a lot more. Last week we had the major release of our new version of Meta AI that is now powered by our latest model, Llama 3. And our goal with Meta AI is to build the world's leading AI service both in quality and usage. The initial rollout of Meta AI is going well. Tens of millions of people have already tried it. The feedback is very positive and, when I first checked in with our teams, the majority of feedback we were getting was people asking us to release Meta AI for them, wherever they are.” As we mentioned in our earlier article, the performance of cyclical stocks is directly proportional to the market conditions (check out undervalued cyclical stocks). The recent performance of stocks such as Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT) and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) might show some optimism around the market. On April 24, Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT) reported earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The company reported Q1 non-GAAP EPS of $1.53, outperforming the consensus estimates by $0.11 and revenues showed an increase of 12.2% at $2.57 billion, beating the forecasts by $40 million. The company also gave its outlook for the second quarter of 2024 and the full year. For Q2 2024, Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT) expects system-wide comparable revenue per available room (RevPAR) to increase by 2% to 4% year-over-year on a currency-neutral basis. For the full year, the system-wide comparable RevPAR is also set to increase by 2% to 4%, and net income is expected to be between $1.586 billion and $1.621 billion. Furthermore, the company expects adjusted EBITDA of $3.375 billion and $3.425 billion, up from its previous record of $3.1 billion in 2023. Finally, the company’s capital returns are expected to be $3 billion. At its latest earnings call, Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.’s (NYSE:HLT) CEO, Chris Nassetta made the following comments: “In the quarter, we signed 30,000 rooms, increasing our pipeline to a record 472,000 rooms, up 2% from last quarter and up 10% year-over-year. Signings meaningfully outperformed our expectations driven by strength in international markets. In Asia-Pacific, we signed agreements for 4 new Conrad properties, further strengthening our luxury pipeline. Globally, an interest in Hilton Garden Inn remained particularly strong with the brand achieving the highest quarter of signings in its history."

Amazon Web Services CEO: We're on track to hit $100 billion in sales in 2024,"What's in the clouds for Amazon's (AMZN) lucrative AWS business: $100 billion in 2024 sales. ""This quarter, we just announced a few days ago that AWS did hit the $100 billion annualized revenue run rate milestone — not many tech companies have done that,"" AWS CEO Adam Selipsky said on the Opening Bid podcast (video above). Added Selipsky, ""I think it's a notable milestone."" Powered by voracious demand for generative AI services and the ongoing push to move workloads to the cloud, Amazon's enterprise cloud operation is fresh off a bang-up first quarter. AWS sales accelerated for the second straight quarter, rising 17% year over year to $25 billion. The business — which Amazon CEO Andy Jassy hired Selipsky to run in 2021 — saw operating profits nearly double to $9.4 billion. The division represented about 62% of Amazon's Q1 operating profits. Selipsky contends that with 85% of companies still storing their data on-premise, the tailwinds for AWS are just beginning to gust. ""We're optimistic about the business outlook for AWS and I think it can continue to grow really rapidly. I don't really see an upper limit on it,"" Selipsky says. ""Of course it's not our birthright, it's not guaranteed. We'll only be as successful as what we do tomorrow for customers."" The avid water skier and wine aficionado says he doesn't wake up each day thinking about crushing rivals Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL). Rather, he spends his time plotting out how to keep customers happy — part of the ""Day One"" culture etched into the company by founder Jeff Bezos. Wall Street believes Selipsky and his AWS team will continue to be the main drivers of Amazon's profits — and stock price."
Amazon shrugs off Chinese competition as profits rise,"Amazon has shrugged off competition from fast-growing Chinese rivals to post its strongest-ever start to the year. The tech giant posted profits of $10.4bn (£8.3bn) in the first three months of 2024, up from $3.2bn during the same period last year. This came despite the growing threat from China’s online retail giants such as Shein and Temu. The latest jump in profits stemmed from revenues surging 13pc to $143.3bn in the first quarter, driven by strong retail sales in North America and rapid growth across its digital infrastructure division, Amazon Web Services (AWS). Amazon hailed surging demand for its artificial intelligence (AI) services, which fall under its AWS arm. Bosses now expect the AWS division to post more than $100bn in turnover across this year as a whole. Shares briefly jumped more than 6pc following the trading update before dropping back to around 2pc. The results, posted on Tuesday night, come as Amazon executives increasingly focus their attention on competition from Chinese shopping sites. Temu, which is owned by China’s PDD, has rapidly grown to tens of millions of monthly shoppers, who have been drawn in by its bargain prices and the tagline “shop like a billionaire”. The Wall Street Journal reported last month that Temu had more than 50m US shoppers on its app despite launching just over a year ago."

UPDATE 1-US opens probe into Alphabet's Waymo over 'unexpected behavior' of self-driving vehicles,"(Updates with no immediate Waymo response in paragraph 4, probe details, earlier investigations) WASHINGTON, May 14 (Reuters) - U.S. auto safety regulators said on Tuesday they have opened an investigation into the performance of Alphabet's Waymo self-driving vehicles after reports of its robotaxis exhibiting driving behavior that potentially violated traffic safety laws. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said its preliminary evaluation into an estimated 444 Waymo vehicles follows 22 reports of 22 incidents including 17 collisions. The agency said in some of those cases the automated driving systems ""appeared to disobey traffic safety control devices"" and some crashes occurred shortly after the automated driving systems ""exhibited unexpected behavior near traffic safety control devices."" Waymo did not immediately respond to a request for comment. This is the latest in a series of investigations opened by NHTSA into performance of self-driving vehicles after initiated probes into General Motors Cruise and Amazon.com's Zoox < AMZN.O>. In February, Waymo recalled 444 self-driving vehicles after two minor collisions in quick succession in Arizona, saying a software error could result in automated vehicles inaccurately predicting the movement of a towed vehicle. NHTSA said all 22 incidents included either self-driving crashes or driverless vehicles that exhibited driving behavior that potentially violated traffic safety laws. The incidents include collisions with stationary and semi-stationary objects such as gates and chains and collisions with parked vehicles. NHTSA also cited incidents ""such as vehicles driving in opposing lanes with nearby oncoming traffic or entering construction zones."" The auto safety agency will investigate the Waymo 5th Generation automated driving system performance ""in the incidents identified in this resume and similar scenarios, as well as to more closely assess any commonalities in these incidents."""
Mag 7 stocks including Apple and Amazon still holding strong,"The ""Magnificent Seven"" accounted for around two-thirds of the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gains last year, but can they repeat those extraordinary returns this time around? Profits for the ""Mag 7"" are forecast to rise 38% in the first quarter from a year ago, dwarfing the overall S&P 500’s 2.4% anticipated year-over-year earnings growth, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data. This group of mega-cap tech companies — Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) — are capitalising on tech growth trends such as artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing. In 2023, Magnificent Seven stocks surged between 48% and 239%, accounting for some 60% of last year's 24% total return for the S&P 500. Here’s how the mega caps performed this first quarter and what Nvidia is expected to deliver when it reports next week. Tesla reported a 9% drop in first-quarter revenue, the biggest decline since 2012, and missed analysts’ estimates, as the electric vehicle company weathers the effect of ongoing price cuts. The electric vehicle (EV) maker said it had made $1.13bn (£910m) over the first three months of the year, compared with $2.51bn a year earlier. CEO Elon Musk said on the call that the company plans to start production of new models in “early 2025, if not late this year,” after previously expecting to begin in the second half of 2025. Read more: Trending tickers: Anglo American, GameStop, Vodafone, Greggs and Novavax “We slightly raised our 2024 deliveries forecast, versus our prior forecast for no growth. Our improved outlook is due to Tesla’s recent price cuts, so we also slightly reduced our near-term automotive gross margin forecast. We think Tesla could cut prices further as management aims to pass along the majority of cost savings to customers to drive demand,” said Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein."
Microsoft to shut Africa development centre in Nigeria,"LAGOS (Reuters) - Microsoft is closing down its Africa Development Centre in the continent's most populous nation Nigeria, which will lead to job losses, a spokesperson said on Wednesday. The centre, based in the commercial capital Lagos was opened in 2022 as part of Microsoft's push to deliver high-end engineering and innovation solutions for the company. The company said it would, however, continue to operate in Nigeria, continuing to prioritize and invest in strategic growth areas. ""Microsoft has decided to close the Africa Development Centre in Nigeria, and as a result some of our employees based in Nigeria will be impacted,"" the Microsoft spokesperson said. ""Organizational and workforce adjustments are a necessary and regular part of managing our business."" It was not immediately clear how many people would be impacted. In December 2022, Microsoft President Brad Smith said Africa represented a burgeoning talent pool in contrast to declining population growth elsewhere. Microsoft at that time had more than 200 engineers in Lagos and more than 500 in Nairobi, Kenya.

EU investigates Facebook owner Meta over child safety and mental health concerns,"The European Commission has opened an investigation into the owner of Facebook and Instagram over concerns that the platforms are creating addictive behaviour among children and damaging mental health. The EU executive said Meta may have breached the Digital Services Act (DSA), a landmark law passed by the bloc last summer that makes digital companies large and small liable for disinformation, shopping scams, child abuse and other online harms. “Today we open formal proceedings against Meta,” the EU commissioner for the internal market, Thierry Breton, said in a statement. “We are not convinced that it has done enough to comply with the DSA obligations to mitigate the risks of negative effects to the physical and mental health of young Europeans on its platforms Facebook and Instagram.” The investigation will explore potential addictive impacts of the platforms, known as “rabbit hole” effects, where an algorithm feeds young people negative content, such as on unrealistic body image. It will also look at the effectiveness of Meta’s age verification tools and privacy for minors. “We are sparing no effort to protect our children,” Breton said. A Meta spokesperson said: “We want young people to have safe, age-appropriate experiences online and have spent a decade developing more than 50 tools and policies designed to protect them. This is a challenge the whole industry is facing, and we look forward to sharing details of our work with the European Commission.” Last month the commission opened an inquiry into Meta under the DSA over its handling of political content amid concerns that it was not doing enough to counter Russian disinformation before the EU elections in June. Under the DSA, platforms are obliged to protect the privacy and safety of children. Following a preliminary investigation, EU officials are concerned that Facebook and Instagram “may exploit the weaknesses and inexperience of minors and cause addictive behaviour”. They are also sceptical about the platform’s age-verification tools. Users are meant to be at least 13 years old to open an account on Facebook or Instagram. One official said that it was “so obviously easy to circumvent some controls” that the commission wanted to know how it was ever assessed by Meta that these measures could be effective and appropriate. An EU official said on Thursday that the commission wanted to use the bloc’s European digital identity wallet for age verification. The wallet, which is still at the testing stage, is intended to make it easier for people across the 27-country union to prove who they are, whether opening a bank account, applying to university or for a job."
Apple’s iPad event was an AI teaser for its future,"Apple’s (AAPL) artificial intelligence push has begun. On Tuesday, the company unveiled its latest iPad Pros, which pack an all-new M4 processor. The chip provides the Pro with a number of benefits including a faster CPU and updated graphics processing unit. But it was Apple’s focus on the M4’s AI capabilities that stood out the most. Apple has been putting its neural engine into processors since 2017 and has previously talked up how it helps power a number of iPhone, iPad, and Mac features for some time. But the M4 unveiling was different, serving as an appetizer for the AI features the company will present at its WWDC event in June, when Apple is widely expected to debut a slew of generative AI-powered software features for its various devices. Apple pointed to a number of the M4’s AI bona fides during the keynote, with vice president of platform architecture Tim Millet specifically noting that the chip is capable of 34 trillion operations per second, a measurement commonly used when describing a chip’s AI performance. Millet also said that the M4’s neural engine is more powerful than any neural processing unit in any AI PC. That’s a direct shot at Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), and Qualcomm (QCOM), which are preparing to or are already rolling out their own AI PC chips designed to run large language models on Windows laptops and desktops. Outside of the M4’s AI processing fundamentals, Apple was mum on any substantive discussion of AI software updates. Sure, Millet said that the M4 helps the iPad Pro quickly isolate a subject from its background in a 4K video, but the M2-equipped iPad Air can do the same thing, just a bit slower. All the company had to offer was that the M4 would make AI apps and features run faster and more smoothly. The company also didn’t provide information about the M4’s performance while training or running large language models (LLMs), something that Intel, Qualcomm, and AMD regularly point to as indicators of their chips’ strengths. Still, the fact that Apple gave consumers, and Wall Street, an early look at its AI thinking is important. The company is widely viewed as behind the curve when it comes to the generative AI race, and investors are banking heavily on WWDC serving as Apple’s big AI coming-out party. CEO Tim Cook has been steadily mentioning AI more over the past few months and said during the company’s most recent earnings call that the iPhone maker is investing heavily in the technology."

Workers are eyeing the exit in 2024 as LinkedIn and Microsoft study warns more people want to quit their jobs now than during the Great Resignation,"The cost of living has spiraled, the threat of layoffs (thanks to AI and overhiring) looms, and flexible working arrangements won before bosses started issuing return-to-office mandates are now like gold dust. That's why, after three years of workers quitting their jobs at a record pace—about 47 million Americans left their jobs in 2021 alone—experts have reassured employers that 2024 will be the year of the “Great Stay”. Even the professor who coined the term “Great Resignation” predicted that it would fizzle out by New Year's Eve 2023. However, new data from LinkedIn and Microsoft shows that they might have been overly optimistic. The two tech giants surveyed 31,000 individuals across 31 countries and found that the percentage of people (46%) who want to quit their jobs in the year ahead is actually higher than in 2021 (40%). Adding to the alarm, American employers are in for a rough ride: Around 85% of professionals in the U.S. are eyeing up a new job this year. Meanwhile, LinkedIn has already witnessed a 14% surge in job applications per role since the fall. Although previous reports have suggested that bosses are back in charge—and using their renewed power to claw back employee-first initiatives like working from home—LinkedIn and Microsoft’s report reveals that they shouldn't get too cozy just yet. And they know it. Nine out of 10 organizations globally are concerned about employee retention, and half of the hiring managers in Europe predict an increase in employee turnover in 2024. This means that keeping workers happy might just climb back to the top of managers' to-do lists. LinkedIn and Microsoft told Fortune that three reasons behind the sudden uptick in workers eyeing up the exit were burnout, a lack of learning opportunities, and artificial intelligence. LinkedIn’s Workforce Confidence Index found that 59% of U.S. employees who are actively job-seeking agree that they feel stuck in their job (vs. 35% of those who are not job-seeking) and 51% feel burnt out from their job (vs 37%). Likewise, Microsoft’s Work Trend Index echoed that 68% of people globally struggle with the pace and volume of work and 46% feel burned out."
UPDATE 3-US agency probes Amazon-owned Zoox self-driving vehicles after two crashes,"(Adds Zoox comment in paragraph 4) By David Shepardson WASHINGTON, May 13 (Reuters) - The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said on Monday it has opened an investigation into Amazon.com's self-driving Zoox vehicles due to unexpected braking leading to two rear-end collisions that injured motorcyclists. The NHTSA said it had opened its preliminary evaluation after two crashes involving the self-driving technology unit's vehicles equipped with the Zoox Automated Driving System that resulted in minor injuries to motorcyclists and started a probe into 500 Zoox vehicles with automated driving systems. Each incident involved a Toyota Highlander equipped with the Zoox automated driving system. A Zoox spokesperson said the company was reviewing the request for information but did not offer in a statement additional details on the incidents. ""Transparency and collaboration with regulators is of the utmost importance, and we remain committed to working closely with NHTSA to answer their questions,"" the statement said. In March, Zoox said it was expanding its vehicle testing in California and Nevada to include a wider area, higher speeds and nighttime driving, as it competes with Alphabet's Waymo robotaxis. Amazon acquired Zoox in 2020 for $1.3 billion. NHTSA said both crashes occurred during daytime lighting conditions and within the operational design limits of the Zoox system. NHTSA said its initial investigation confirmed ""each of the Zoox vehicles was operating with the ADS engaged in the moments leading up to each collision."" The investigation will evaluate the Zoox Automated Driving System performance particularly relating to the collisions as well as ""the behavior in crosswalks around vulnerable road users, and in other similar rear-end collision scenarios."" NHTSA in March 2023 opened a probe into the self-certification by Zoox in 2022 of a robotaxi without traditional driving controls."
"Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Microsoft, Alphabet, Nvidia and Arista Networks","Chicago, IL – May 16, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Nvidia NVDA and Arista Networks ANET. Yes, I know the last year has been all AI every day, but this theme is still early days. Exciting new products built from generative AI models are just beginning to come to market and will continue to change the way we interact with technology. Just this week there were two significant releases from both Microsoft’s, OpenAI and Alphabet. Additionally, now that broad markets have traded sideways for the better part of two months, energy has been built for a major breakout in the leading names. These product releases should be a valuable catalyst for the next big rally. OpenAI introduced the newest iteration of their primary AI model, GPT-4o. The demonstrations of GPT-4o were extremely impressive, with one video showing the AI model interacting with and tutoring a young boy on his math homework. The GPT, young boy and father were all in conversation with each other, and the GPT helped him through the process in a supportive and logical way. It was really something, and I recommend those interested seek out some of the most recent demonstrations released online. Then, at Google I/O, Alphabet’s annual developer conference, the company introduced its newest AI enabled “Agents,” built throughout its platforms. This product is built on Gemini, Alphabet’s response to OpenAI’s GPT. In one demo, the presenter wanted to return a pair of shoes they bought online. They took a picture of them, and said to the agent, “I want to return these shoes, they don’t fit.” Gemini proceeded to find the order info in Gmail, fill out a return form, and scheduled a pickup from UPS. It really functioned like a personal assistant. The presentation also showed Gemini agents planning detailed trips catered to specific interests, summarizing long email chains, and working across multiple external websites to really simplify workflow. Again, I recommend those interested go watch the demo videos."
PayPal Is Holding Its Ground Amid Clash Of Digital Payment Titans,"In recent years, PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: PYPL) has been struggling as Big Tech titans, Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) expanded its footprint in digital payments. Even Robinhood (NASDAQ: HOOD) is entering the credit card arena. The Robinhood Gold Card pitch is impressive, to say the least, and promises to give both Apple and PayPal a headache. But at the end of April, PayPal showed it is determined to reignite the growth story of its brand offferings while its unbranded businesses continue to grow, as it confidently lifted its full year adjusted profit guidance. For the quarter ended on March 31st, total payment volumes grew 14% to $403.9 billion on increased global consumer spending that held up amid an uncertain economy. Net revenue climbed 10% to $7.7 billion. Aided by cost cuts, adjusted operating margin improved to 18.2%. For 2024, PayPal guided for adjusted profit growth in in mid-to-high single-digit percentages, while it previously forecasted it will remain flat. Focus on upgrades in attempt to win back investor support. PayPal is trying to woo investors by making efforts to become leaner as it focuses on achieving profitable growth. CEO Alex Chriss spoke of PayPal’s work to instill cost discipline, stating that management is “leaving no stone unturned when it comes to reducing unproductive costs”. While turning things around will likely take time and it is already taking longer than some expected, PayPal feels confident in its long-term opportunities as it already evolved from a checkout button to a platform of end-to-end solutions for both merchants and consumers. It’s no exaggeration to say that the digital wallet universe is a story of the clash of the titans, with PayPal going against Apple and against Google. Apple, Google and PayPal are competing for consumers’ wallets and the battle is as intense as it gets. Apply Pay is going from strength to strength, and it is also bringing the entire Apple ecosystem for the ride, seriously challenging PayPal whose days of dominating mobile payments are long gone. But PayPal is not giving its lunch to Apple nor anyone else by showing determination not to become obsolete. After all, it made a name for itself, and with a great name, it expanded into a supersized company, that on one hand is harder to steer, but on the other, it offers the broadest assortment of services to offer solutions that can supercharge a merchant's business. With its latest quarterly report, PayPal made it clear it will do whatever it takes to reignite growth of its branded offerings. DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

"Gen Zers could swipe millennials’ jobs if they have AI skills, LinkedIn and Microsoft data shows","Millennials, who weathered the 2008 financial crisis, face further challenges as they contend with job market shifts. Their traditional career trajectories are being reshaped by digital-savvy Gen Zers armed with AI expertise, according to the 2024 Annual Work Trend Index by Microsoft and LinkedIn. Surveying 31,000 individuals across 31 nations, the tech titans reveal a shift in employer preferences: ""Managers say AI aptitude could rival experience."" Significantly, 71% of leaders preferred hiring candidates with AI skills over those with more conventional experience. Compounding the issue, employers show little inclination to train existing staff in AI. Despite 66% of leaders insisting on AI skills for new hires, a mere 25% of firms plan to provide training in generative AI this year. This trend implies a burgeoning advantage for younger applicants, as employers must cast a wider net for talent beyond their organizations. Furthermore, Gen Zers with AI acumen not only stand to secure prime positions but also accelerate their ascent up the corporate ladder. The report reveals that 77% of leaders intend to delegate increased responsibilities to early-career hires with AI proficiencies. Karin Kimbrough, LinkedIn’s chief economist, tells Fortune that employees—not their bosses—are driving the push to integrate AI into their jobs.  That includes entry-level employees, like Gen Zers, who are still gaining their career footing. “AI is at work; employees are not waiting for their employers to set up official business processes to use it,” she said. “They’re already experimenting, learning, and trying it out, because they see the value proposition.” In the report, Microsoft and LinkedIn call those particularly AI-inclined workers “power users,” because they’re the most adept at finding ways to use AI to save time and improve their own performance—and while younger workers historically skew more pro-tech, the report finds that power user employees aren’t limited to one generation."
Why This 1 Growth Stock Could Be a Great Addition to Your Portfolio,"For new and old investors, taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals. Many investors also have a go-to methodology that helps guide their buy and sell decisions. One way to find winning stocks based on your preferred way of investing is to use the Zacks Style Scores, which are indicators that rate stocks based on three widely-followed investing types: value, growth, and momentum. Why This 1 Growth Stock Should Be On Your Watchlist Different than value or momentum investors, growth-oriented investors are concerned with a stock's future prospects, and the overall financial health and strength of a company. Thus, they'll want to focus on the Growth Style Score, which analyzes characteristics like projected and historical earnings, sales, and cash flow to find stocks that will see sustainable growth over time. Amazon (AMZN) Amazon.com is one of the largest e-commerce providers, with sprawling operations in North America, now spreading across the globe. AMZN boasts a Growth Style Score of A and VGM Score of A, and holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating. Its bottom-line is projected to rise 56.6% year-over-year for 2024, while Wall Street anticipates its top line to improve by 11%. 12 analysts revised their earnings estimate higher in the last 60 days for fiscal 2024, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.48 to $4.54 per share. AMZN also boasts an average earnings surprise of 48.2%. On a historic basis, Amazon has generated cash flow growth of 25.3%, and is expected to report cash flow expansion of 59.4% this year. Investors should take the time to consider AMZN for their portfolios due to its solid Zacks Rank rating, notable growth metrics, and impressive Growth and VGM Style Scores."

"Meta exploring AI-assisted earbuds with cameras, The Information reports","(Reuters) - Meta Platforms is exploring making earphones powered by artificial intelligence with cameras, The Information reported on Monday citing employees familiar with the matter. A slew of companies, from startups to conglomerates including Meta, are looking to develop AI-based wearable devices to capture growing interest in the sector. The Facebook-parent expects the device, being explored under a project named ""Camerabuds"", to identify objects and translate foreign languages, the report added. Meta announced new generation Ray-Ban smart glasses, priced at $299, in September last year, which will also have its AI built in, with the ability to give information on the item a user is looking at.

"TikTok to label AI-generated images, video from OpenAI and elsewhere","By Stephen Nellis May 9 (Reuters) - TikTok said on Thursday it would start using a technology aimed at helping it label images and video generated by artificial intelligence and uploaded to the video sharing service. TikTok said it would adopt ""Content Credentials,"" a digital watermark that denotes how images were created and edited. The Content Credential technology was spearheaded by Adobe but is open for other companies to use and already has been adopted by companies such as ChatGPT creator OpenAI. Researchers have expressed concerned that AI-generated content could be used as misinformation in an attempt to interfere with U.S. elections this fall. TikTok was already among a group of 20 tech companies that earlier this year signed an accord pledging to fight it. YouTube, owned by Alphabet's Google, as well as Meta Platforms, which owns Instagram and Facebook, have also said they plan to use Content Credentials. For the system to work, both the maker of the generative AI tool used to make content and the platform used to distribute the contents must both agree to use the industry standard. If a person uses OpenAI's Dall-E tool to generate an image, for example, OpenAI attaches a watermark to the resulting image. If that marked image is then uploaded to TikTok, it will be automatically labeled as AI-generated. TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, has 170 million users in the United States, which recently passed a law requiring ByteDance to divest TikTok or face a ban. TikTok and ByteDance have sued to block the law, arguing it violates the First Amendment. TikTok already labels AI-generated content made with tools inside the app but the latest move would apply a label to content generated outside of the service. ""We also have policies that prohibit realistic AI that is not labeled, so if realistic AI (generated contents) appears on the platform, then we will remove it as violating our community guidelines,"" Adam Presser, head of operations and trust and safety at TikTok, said in an interview.

Jim Cramer last week thanked Fed Chair Jerome Powell for giving an ""all-clear"" sign by keeping interest rates unchanged. Cramer said that the Fed's dovish comments catapulted the market from the pits of deep red to new highs. He thinks Jerome Powell has become ""the bull's friend for the moment, maybe best friend."" Jim Cramer said that despite the signs of ""softness all over the place,"" Powell is currently ""more of a dove than a hawk"" since he believes inflation will ""go away on its own."" Cramer said Jerome Powell was ""badgered"" by the media about the possibility of another rate hike. But Powell, according to Cramer, is ""too smart"" as he didn’t take the ""bait"" and took the ""dreaded"" rate hike scenario ""off the table."" "" I think Jay Powell has realized that these brown shoots are doing the work for him and his consistent messaging in the face of endless Fedspeak tells me that I think you should hand on to stocks."" Jim Cramer in another program last week again voiced his frustrations about the market's obsession with the Federal Reserve's comment, saying jobs numbers, inflation, possibility of rate cuts and the Fed's future moves is ""all we talk about."" Cramer said that some analysts were expecting the Fed chief Jerome Powell to ""lower the boom"" of the stock market by ""saying something hawkish."" Cramer is surprised that some circles in the market are talking about another raise. ""We are one again hostage to everyone's worries about the Fed which is another way of saying, everyone's worries about inflation."" After analyzing the current market situation, Cramer came straight to what matters the most for an average investor: ""So, what wins in this environment? What do you do? Well, pretty much everything is going to kind of work here,"" Cramer said before analyzing different stocks some of which we will discuss in this article.

Meta Platforms Bought Some Time With Long-Term AI Potential,"On Wednesday, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: META) topped Wall Street estimates with its first quarter results. But, stock plunged 16% due to a light revenue guidance that overshadowed the fact its revenue grew at a fastest quarterly rate since 2021 and net income more than doubled. Like Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), Meta didn’t talk much about AI, until now. During the earnings call, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg detailed the company’s AI roadmap, hinting at a shift from chatbots to AI agents, highlighting confidence in the company’s leadership on the AI front.           For the first three months of the year, Meta reported revenue expanded 27% YoY to $36.46 billion, surpassing LSEG’s estimate of $36.16. Net income more than doubled to $12.37 billion or $4.71 per share, surpassing LSEG’s estimate of $4.32 as the Facebook-parent successfully lowered its sales and marketing costs by 16% compared to last year’s comparable quarter. As for its userbase metric, Meta revealed there were 3.24 billion family daily active people in March, which represents a 7% YoY rise while average revenue per user in the quarter was $11.20. Digital advertising makes 98% of Meta’s revenue and it rose 27% YoY to $35.64 billion. Therefore, building leading AI has a lot to do with turning those efforts into ad dollars. With revenue of $440 million, Reality Labs unit reported a loss of $3.85 billion. Since the end of 2020, Meta’s most important division it based its new identity on lost more than $45 billion. As for the second quarter, Meta guided for revenue between $36.5 billion and $39 billion, while analysts on average expected $38.3 billion. Meta guided for capital expenditures in the range between $35 billion and $40 billion, while previously forecasting $30 billion to $37 billion. The increase is due to accelerated AI investments. Meta bought some time with long-term potential of AI. After a brutal 2022 during which Meta lost about two thirds of its value and figuring out how to live in a new privacy environment that Apple cooked up. But, Meta or more precisely, Zuckerberg, made sure that sure that smaller advertisers knew that, thanks to Apple and the privacy changes it introduced, it got more expensive to reach their potential customers. Apple and Meta feud, or more precisely, the feud of their respective CEOs has been going on since 2014, at least. But Apple is well used to attacks regarding its App Store commissions and Tim Cook often simply leaves such comments without a response. But, Meta clearly preserved its users and ad dollars, and it seems to have succeeded to restore Wall Street’s confidence with its cost cuts efforts it kicked off early last year, marking 2023 as its year of efficiency. Although AI still didn’t provide the lift that Meta needs, Zuckerberg succeeded to convince Wall Street of the company’s AI leadership potential, which will take time to be realized through the company’s financials. But, then again, Meta certainly has a strong record of monetizing its services. DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only. It is not intended as investing advice."
The ending of Google's monopoly trial has Silicon Valley on edge,"Google has a lot at stake as a federal judge weighs whether the tech giant’s search empire should be broken up. So does the rest of Silicon Valley. A landmark antitrust case pitting Google (GOOG, GOOGL) against the Justice Department entered its final stage this past week as prosecutors from the federal government and 14 states said in their closing arguments that Google illegally monopolized the online search and search advertising markets. Google's lawyer, John Schmidtlein, pushed back one more time with a claim the company has made from the beginning: ""Google is winning because it’s better,"" he said. A government win would certainly threaten a giant piece of Google’s $237.8 billion profit engine. But the outcome, which will be decided by US District Judge Amit Mehta in the weeks or months to come, also has giant implications for some of the other big names in the tech world. That's because Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) are defending themselves against a series of other federal- and state-led antitrust suits, some of which make similar claims, and because all three stand to lose or gain depending on the outcome. In Apple’s case, US attorneys have alleged the iPhone maker blocked rivals from entering the smartphone market by using a “web of contractual restrictions.” A similar claim was made by the government in Google's case, which hinges on several types of contracts that Google allegedly used to cement its search dominance. ""The broad lessons here are a long way off, but this is clearly a really important time when the very first of these tech cases is going to be decided,"" said University of Washington antitrust professor Douglas Ross. ""I do think they're going to be interested in how narrowly or broadly [the judge] defines the markets here,"" Ross added, ""and if there is any learning in what he writes that might have application elsewhere."""

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Can the Stock Move Higher?,"The market expects Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) to deliver flat earnings compared to the year-ago quarter on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates. The earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 30, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower. While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise. Zacks Consensus Estimate This chipmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.60 per share in its upcoming report, which represents no change from the year-ago quarter. Revenues are expected to be $5.42 billion, up 1.2% from the year-ago quarter. Estimate Revisions Trend The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.87% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period. Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts. Earnings Whisper"

Jim Cramer last week thanked Fed Chair Jerome Powell for giving an ""all-clear"" sign by keeping interest rates unchanged. Cramer said that the Fed's dovish comments catapulted the market from the pits of deep red to new highs. He thinks Jerome Powell has become ""the bull's friend for the moment, maybe best friend."" Jim Cramer said that despite the signs of ""softness all over the place,"" Powell is currently ""more of a dove than a hawk"" since he believes inflation will ""go away on its own."" Cramer said Jerome Powell was ""badgered"" by the media about the possibility of another rate hike. But Powell, according to Cramer, is ""too smart"" as he didn’t take the ""bait"" and took the ""dreaded"" rate hike scenario ""off the table."" "" I think Jay Powell has realized that these brown shoots are doing the work for him and his consistent messaging in the face of endless Fedspeak tells me that I think you should hand on to stocks."" Jim Cramer in another program last week again voiced his frustrations about the market's obsession with the Federal Reserve's comment, saying jobs numbers, inflation, possibility of rate cuts and the Fed's future moves is ""all we talk about."" Cramer said that some analysts were expecting the Fed chief Jerome Powell to ""lower the boom"" of the stock market by ""saying something hawkish."" Cramer is surprised that some circles in the market are talking about another raise. ""We are one again hostage to everyone's worries about the Fed which is another way of saying, everyone's worries about inflation."" After analyzing the current market situation, Cramer came straight to what matters the most for an average investor: ""So, what wins in this environment? What do you do? Well, pretty much everything is going to kind of work here,"" Cramer said before analyzing different stocks some of which we will discuss in this article.

Google Stares Down Largest Tech Antitrust Ruling In 2 Decades — Is AT&T-Style Breakup Next?,"Closing arguments for the largest antitrust trial to date against Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), also known as Google, wrapped up last week. Now, it's up to Judge Amit Mehta to decide on a ruling that could change the fate of the company and others in the big tech space. Mehta, of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, is expected to come up with a decision before the end of the year. The case was put forth by the Justice Department in 2020, together with attorneys general from 11 states, who are arguing that Google has engaged in anti-competitive practices in order to maintain its dominance in the internet search space. Specifically, they're looking at the billions of dollars Google pays monthly to other tech companies in order to secure its place as the default search engine in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung, LG, Motorola owned by Lenovo Group Ltd (OTC:LNVGY) and other devices as well as in browsers like Mozilla Firefox and Opera. The plaintiffs argue that this practice prevents other companies from succeeding with their own search engine products, giving Google disproportionate market share in the search engine space. Last week, court documents revealed that Google paid Apple $20 billion in 2022 to be the default search engine on Safari, the web browser used on iPhone, iPad and Mac devices. In 2021, the figure amounted to $26.3 billion when including other browsers like Firefox. Google is estimated to account for about 90% of all internet searches, widely outpacing competitors like Microsoft Corp's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Bing, Yahoo Search or DuckDuckGo, a search engine that is privately owned and focused on user privacy. The final arguments from Google's attorneys as well as DOJ lawyer David Dahlquist followed a 10-week trial between September and November 2023. Read also: Google Fights Fortnite Maker’s Play Store Changes Amid Antitrust Battle: What’s at Stake? The case, however, was three years in the making for the Justice Department. The central argument of the lawsuit is that Google’s control of today’s internet is extensive enough to be considered a monopoly, and that it violated antitrust laws by paying competitor firms, cell phone manufacturers, and wireless internet providers to maintain its position as the default search engine."
Apple’s iPad event was an AI teaser for its future,"Apple’s (AAPL) artificial intelligence push has begun. On Tuesday, the company unveiled its latest iPad Pros, which pack an all-new M4 processor. The chip provides the Pro with a number of benefits including a faster CPU and updated graphics processing unit. But it was Apple’s focus on the M4’s AI capabilities that stood out the most. Apple has been putting its neural engine into processors since 2017 and has previously talked up how it helps power a number of iPhone, iPad, and Mac features for some time. But the M4 unveiling was different, serving as an appetizer for the AI features the company will present at its WWDC event in June, when Apple is widely expected to debut a slew of generative AI-powered software features for its various devices. Apple pointed to a number of the M4’s AI bona fides during the keynote, with vice president of platform architecture Tim Millet specifically noting that the chip is capable of 34 trillion operations per second, a measurement commonly used when describing a chip’s AI performance. Millet also said that the M4’s neural engine is more powerful than any neural processing unit in any AI PC. That’s a direct shot at Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), and Qualcomm (QCOM), which are preparing to or are already rolling out their own AI PC chips designed to run large language models on Windows laptops and desktops. Outside of the M4’s AI processing fundamentals, Apple was mum on any substantive discussion of AI software updates. Sure, Millet said that the M4 helps the iPad Pro quickly isolate a subject from its background in a 4K video, but the M2-equipped iPad Air can do the same thing, just a bit slower. All the company had to offer was that the M4 would make AI apps and features run faster and more smoothly. The company also didn’t provide information about the M4’s performance while training or running large language models (LLMs), something that Intel, Qualcomm, and AMD regularly point to as indicators of their chips’ strengths. Still, the fact that Apple gave consumers, and Wall Street, an early look at its AI thinking is important. The company is widely viewed as behind the curve when it comes to the generative AI race, and investors are banking heavily on WWDC serving as Apple’s big AI coming-out party. CEO Tim Cook has been steadily mentioning AI more over the past few months and said during the company’s most recent earnings call that the iPhone maker is investing heavily in the technology."
Meta's AI spending tests Facebook's growth-first playbook,"This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings A million dollars isn't cool. You know what's cool? $40 billion in capex. Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg invoked an earlier Facebook era, when the social network transitioned to mobile phones, to remind investors that you must first spend money to make money. Zuckerberg was right to remind investors about the concept of, well, investing because after glimpsing the sheer cost of an AI investment spree, Wall Street shoved Meta shares down an elevator shaft. While the News Feed, Reels, and Stories solidified the company's grow first, monetize later playbook, investors are still not fully on board with Zuckerberg's AI gambit. By many important measures, Meta delivered a stellar quarter. But investors still recoiled at ballooning expenses and an admission that the company needs several more years before aggressive AI investments become profitable business lines. Capital expenditures are now expected to rise as high as $40 billion for the year, up from a high of $37 billion."
UPDATE 1-Musk's X Corp loses lawsuit against Israeli data-scraping company,"(Adds comment from Bright Data CEO, Meta lawsuit against Bright Data, paragraphs 6, 8) By Jonathan Stempel May 10 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge dismissed a lawsuit in which Elon Musk's X Corp accused an Israeli data-scraping company of illegally copying and selling content, and selling tools that let others copy and sell content, from the social media platform. U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco ruled on Thursday that X, formerly Twitter, failed to plausibly allege that Bright Data Ltd violated its user agreement by allowing the scraping and evading X's own anti-scraping technology. Alsup said using scraping tools is not inherently fraudulent, and giving social media companies free rein to decide how public data are used ""risks the possible creation of information monopolies that would disserve the public interest."" The judge also said X was not entitled to ""de facto copyright ownership"" in copyrighted content that X's users made available to the public. Lawyers for X did not immediately respond on Friday to requests for comment. Or Lenchner, Bright Data's chief executive, said in a statement: ""Bright Data's victory over X makes it clear to the world that public information on the web belongs to all of us, and any attempt to deny the public access will fail."" Alsup said X can try to amend its complaint, which sought unspecified compensatory and punitive damages for breach of contract, trespass and misappropriation. The San Francisco-based company sued Bright Data last July. In January, another San Francisco judge ruled that Bright Data had not violated Meta Platforms' terms of service by scraping data from Facebook and Instagram. Meta ended its lawsuit against Bright Data a month later."
"Dow at 40,000: Why stocks still have 'plenty of room to run'","Investors are catching the bull by the horns. That’s the sentiment gripping Wall Street, as stocks notch record highs and the market is on track for its best month of the year. A late surge in the final stretch of trading pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJIA) to close above 40,000 for the first time ever Friday — a milestone that comes just 874 trading days after the Dow first closed above 30,000. The blue-chip index added 1.2% for the week, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq (^IXIC) both recorded their longest weekly winning streaks since February. “Psychologically it's amusing,” JPMorgan Asset Management’s Jack Manley said of the milestone on Yahoo Finance’s ‘Morning Brief.’ “The rally feels good because the macro data has been pretty good,” he said. Goldman Sachs (GS), Microsoft (MSFT), and UnitedHealth (UNH) were the top three point contributors to the Dow’s charge from 30,000 to 40,000. And the makeup of the Dow looks different than it did during previous milestones. The index most recently replaced Walgreens (WBA) with Amazon (AMZN), bringing it to its current composition. This week’s softer inflation print helped bolster the case for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates before year end, as more investors place their bets on a soft landing. In a note to clients this week, Truist co-chief investment strategist Keith Lerner wrote the recent rally is a “healthy sign and typical characteristic of a bull market,” suggesting “upside potential remains.”"
Movement Labs Raises $38M for Rollup Based on Facebook's Move Language,"Movement Labs, a blockchain company that aims to bring Facebook's Move Virtual Machine to Ethereum, has secured $38 million in a Series A financing round led by Polychain Capital. The firm was founded by Rushi Manche, 21, and Cooper Scanlon, 24 – Vanderbilt college dropouts who say they are on a mission to ""make blockchain security sexy"" with the launch of Movement L2, their new layer-2 Ethereum blockchain based on the Move programming paradigm. Manche said he got interested in Move after reading an article a few years ago, when he was still in college, about Facebook's efforts in the blockchain space. ""Security has never been a priority for the industry,"" Manche said in an interview. ""It's always, like, '$100 million hack,' '$20 million attack' – we're so succumbed and numb to the attack issue when in reality, that's a huge issue for retail."" Move is today best known for its association with Aptos and Sui, layer-1 blockchains with a focus on low fees and high throughput. By extending the tech to an Ethereum layer-2 – a blockchain that writes data to Ethereum but offers faster and cheaper transactions – the Movement team hopes to achieve greater security and transaction speeds than layer-2 incumbents. Movement's funding round saw participation from venture capital firms including Hack VC, Placeholder, Archetype, Maven 11, Robot Ventures, Figment Capital, Nomad Capital, Bankless Ventures, OKX Ventures, dao5, and Aptos Labs – the company behind Aptos. ""Between 2022 and 2023, hackers exploited smart contracts for over $5.4 billion, affecting major protocols like Curve and KyberSwap through common reentrancy attacks,"" Movement explained in a statement. ""Movement’s EVM allows Move and Solidity developers to deploy code that is fully verified at runtime, preventing attack vectors like reentrancy from executing."" ""With embedded firmware application runtime, we can stop 90% of attack vectors or more,"" Manche told CoinDesk. Move also uses parallelization – a method for processing multiple streams of activity at once that's used by Solana and Move-based chains to achieve greater transaction throughput. ""This combination of speed and security makes for a really powerful VM,"" said Manche. Move is the stand-out product of Meta's ill-fated foray into blockchain technology. Then still called Facebook, the company made a big splash in 2019 with the announcement that it was launching a cryptocurrency called ""Libra"" (later renamed ""Diem""). Diem's blockchain was supposed to use Move, a new open-source programming language based on Rust that Meta designed to make the entire process of coding up a blockchain more secure and efficient. ""In August 2022, I was in college with my co-founder at Vanderbilt and I read this article, 'Facebook is building a new programming language,'"" recalled Manche. ""I would use Cosmos and the [Ethereum Virtual Machine], but there weren't a lot of users – wasn't a lot of volume."""

Microsoft asks some employees in China to move to other countries,"Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter, which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world. Microsoft has asked at least 100 of its employees in China to consider moving to other countries, according to Chinese state media reports. The reports come as relations between Beijing and Washington deteriorate over technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and clean energy. Microsoft employees, mostly involved with cloud computing, were recently offered the opportunity to work in the United States, Australia or Ireland, among other countries, state-run outlet The Paper said in a report Wednesday, citing an unnamed source. “Providing internal opportunities is a regular part of managing our global business. As part of this process, we shared an optional internal transfer opportunity with a subset of employees,” a Microsoft spokesperson told CNN on Thursday. It did not specify the number of workers who had received the offer. The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Microsoft asked as many as 800 employees, mostly engineers with Chinese nationality working on cloud computing and AI, to consider relocating. The Journal, which cited unnamed sources, reported last year that the Biden administration was preparing to restrict Chinese firms’ access to US cloud services. The company entered China in 1992 and for decades has counted on its well-known Beijing-based research lab, Microsoft Research Lab Asia, to help it build influence. “Everyone is confused,” an employee told the Paper, as the affected staff has been given less than a month to decide. Yicai, a Chinese state-owned financial media outlet, wrote that more than 100 employees were affected. It added that people had the option not to move. The reports come in the same week President Joe Biden announced tariffs on $18 billion worth of imports of Chinese electric vehicles and an array of other products. Biden said he was trying to prevent unfair competition from China decimating US industries."
13 Most Popular Retail Investor Stocks in 2024,"In this piece, we will take a look at the 13 most popular retail investor stocks in 2024. If you want to skip our introduction to how retail trading has changed over these past couple of years and some recent trends, then you can check out 5 Most Popular Retail Investor Stocks in 2024.  The stock market of 2024 is quite different from the one present at the turn of the millennium. This is because the internet and consumer technology have made vast sums of information available to anyone willing to learn. As a result, more people are able to invest in the stock market, and this trend soared during the coronavirus pandemic. While the pandemic is known for the devastating disease and the lock downs, at the same time, it also put retail investors for the first time on Wall Street's map. This happened through the meme stock mania, which saw popular companies GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AMC) soar on the stock market as retail investors joined forces on social media and bought the shares in bulk. The rise of retail investors has also introduced a new angle to investing. Professional investors, like hedge funds, only have one objective in mind when making their decisions. This is profit maximization, whether the shares are bought long, sold short, or held to force a change at the firm as is with activist investing. On the flip side, retail investors, while also naturally influenced by the profit motive, also invest in stocks that they like. For instance, hedge funds had sold GameStop short and negatively influenced its share price because they remained unconvinced about the traditional brick and mortar retailer's ability to compete in the digital new world dominated by virtual video game downloads offered by platforms run by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY). The retail camp, on the other hand, had also invested in GameStop because of their attachment to the brand. 2024 is seeing this bifurcation between retail and professional investors surface once again. One of the hottest, and most volatile, stocks this year has been Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. (NASDAQ:DJT). Like GameStop before it, DJT's investors also have a personal motive for piling into the shares. Retail investors have invested in the stock because they trust the former US President, and have continued to hold the shares even though TMTG battles short sellers. TMTG is a social media company that operates Truth Social, a platform President Trump set up after he was banned from Twitter (now X) and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s Facebook. With the US Presidential race for 2024 having kicked off, investors are also battling it out on Wall Street as TMTG stock rises and falls. DJT - the stock - is quite fresh as it commenced trading just earlier this year. Before the merger between Digital World Acquisition Corp (DWAC) and TMTG, the shares had traded under DWAC and had become a proxy for the former President's daily affairs. Soon after its merger, TMTG shared with investors that it had earned $4 million in income from ads run on its platform. The stock DJT is up 138% year to date, entering the year after TMTG sued press outlets for incorrectly interpreting its financial statements. The fireworks in its share price are also recent, as $DJT's predecessor stock, $DWAC, was flat throughout 2023. Like other special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), DWAC's stock also posted its strongest gains soon after the stock was listed for public trading. Back in October 2021, the stock stunned the market by soaring to $175 and settled to close at $94, the highest in its history. This marked a 1,500% price appreciation in the two trading days after news hit the wires that TMTG was merging with DWAC as the Trump team geared up to launch Truth Social. From its peak close of $94, the shares are down by 55%, after they narrowed the drop to 34% earlier this year after the merger and the ticker change to DJT. With these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the most popular stocks among retail investors. A couple of notable names are Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). michael-fortsch-SIz6izQKxzs-unsplash Our Methodology  To make our list of the most popular stocks among retail investors, we used data from the Robinhood Index, Fintel, and Vanda Research to make a list of all the stocks that ordinary traders can't get enough of. For these popular retail investor stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator."
Google invests 1 billion euros in Finnish data centre to drive AI growth,"HELSINKI (Reuters) - Alphabet-owned Google will invest a further 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) into the expansion of its data centre campus in Finland to drive its artificial intelligence (AI) business growth in Europe, it said in a statement on Monday. In recent years, many data centres have been located in the Nordic countries because of the region's cooler climate, tax breaks and abundant availability of renewable power. Finland's Nordic neighbours Sweden and Norway have recently grown increasingly critical of hosting them, with some industry experts arguing the Nordic countries should use their renewable power for products such as green steel that could leave higher surplus value in the countries. But Finland's wind power capacity has increased so rapidly in recent years, by 75% to 5,677 megawatts in 2022 alone, that on windy days prices have plummeted to negative, industry statistics showed. Therefore there is still renewable capacity available for data centres such as Google's, which acquires wind power in Finland under long term contracts. Analysts believe data centres' power consumption is set to massively increase due to the rapid growth in AI usage, which Google, too, cited for one of the reasons behind its investment decision, alongside its Hamina data centre in Finland already operating with 97% carbon-free energy. ""Heat coming out of our Finnish data center will be re-routed to the district heating network in nearby Hamina, covering local households, schools and public service buildings,"" Google said in the statement. It added that it aimed to achieve net zero emissions across all of its operations and value chain by 2030. In addition to its Finnish investment, the search and cloud giant announced last month it would build new data centres in the Netherlands and Belgium.

"Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript","Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript April 24, 2024 Meta Platforms, Inc. beats earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $4.71, expectations were $4.32. Operator: Good afternoon.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded. Thank you very much. Ken Dorell, Meta's Director of Investor Relations, you may begin. Kenneth Dorell: Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Meta Platform's first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Joining me today to discuss our results are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO; and Susan Li, CFO. Before we get started, I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause these results to differ materially are set forth in today's earnings press release and in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. During this call, we will present both GAAP and certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. The earnings press release and an accompanying investor presentation are available on our website at investor.fb.com. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Mark. Mark Zuckerberg: All right. Thanks, Ken, and everyone, thanks for joining. It's been a good start to the year both in terms of product momentum and business performance. We estimate that more than 3.2 billion people use at least one of our apps each day and we're seeing healthy growth in the US. And I want to call out WhatsApp specifically where the number of daily actives and message sends in the US keeps gaining momentum and I think we're on a good path there. We've also made good progress on our AI and Metaverse efforts and that's where I'm going to focus most of my comments today. So let's start with AI. We are building a number of different AI services from Meta AI, our AI assistant that you can ask any question across our apps and glasses, to creator AIs that help creators engage their communities and that fans can interact with, to business AIs that we think every business eventually on our platform will use to help customers buy things and get customer support, to internal coding and development AIs, to hardware like glasses for people to interact with AIs and a lot more. Last week, we had the major release of our new version of Meta AI that is now powered by our latest model, Llama 3 and our goal with Meta AI is to build the world's leading AI service, both in quality and usage. The initial rollout of Meta AI is going well. Tens of millions of people have already tried it. The feedback is very positive and when I first checked in with our teams, the majority of feedback we were getting was people asking us to release Meta AI for them wherever they are. So we've started launching Meta AI in some English speaking countries and we'll roll out in more languages and countries over the coming months. You all know our product development playbook by this point. We release an early version of a product to a limited audience to gather feedback and start improving it. And then once we think it's ready, then we make it available to more people. That early release was last fall and with this release, we are now moving to that next growth phase of our playbook. We believe that Meta AI with Llama 3 is now the most intelligent AI assistant that you can freely use and now that we have the superior quality product, we are making it easier for lots of people to use it within WhatsApp, Messenger, Instagram and Facebook. Now in addition to answering more complex queries, a few other notable and unique features from this release. Meta AI now creates animations from still images and now generates high quality images so fast that it can create and update them as you are typing, which is pretty awesome. I've seen a lot of people commenting about that experience online and how they've never seen or experienced anything like it before. In terms of the core AI model and intelligence that's powering Meta AI, I'm very pleased with how Llama 3 has come together so far. The 8 billion and 70 billion parameter models that we released are best-in-class for their scale. The 400 plus billion parameter model that we're still training seems on track to be industry leading on several benchmarks and I expect their models are just going to improve further from open source contributions. Overall, I view the results our teams have achieved here as another key milestone in showing that we have the talent, data and ability to scale infrastructure to build the world's leading AI models and services and this leads me to believe that we should invest significantly more over the coming years to build even more advanced models and the largest scale AI services in the world. As we're scaling CapEx and energy expenses for AI, we'll continue focusing on operating the rest of our company efficiently, but realistically, even with shifting many of our existing resources to focus on AI, we'll still grow our investment envelope meaningfully before we make much revenue from some of these new products. I think it's worth calling that out that we've historically seen a lot of volatility in our stock during this phase of our product playbook where we're investing in scaling a new product, but aren't yet monetizing it. We saw this with reels, stories as newsfeed transitioned to mobile and more and I also expect to see a multi-year investment cycle before we fully scaled Meta AI, business AIs and more into the profitable services I expect as well."

Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Meta Platforms and Netflix,"Chicago, IL – April 26, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Meta Platforms META and Netflix NFLX. Earnings season has continued to roll along at a rapid pace, with this week's reporting docket notably stacked. We've heard from several market heavyweights, including Meta Platforms and Netflix. Shares of each faced selling pressure post-earnings, erasing a chunk of the year-to-date gains we've seen from each stock. It raises a valid question – is the selling overdone, or is this a rich opportunity for investors? Let's take a closer look at each company's quarterly release. Netflix Concerning headline figures, Netflix posted a 17% beat relative to the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate and posted sales modestly ahead of the consensus, with both items showing considerable growth from the year-ago periods. Total subscribers were reported at 269.6 million, reflecting a 16% jump year-over-year. Still, the real surprise in the quarterly release was that the company will no longer report quarterly membership numbers starting next year in 2025 Q1, likely explaining the knee-jerk reaction post-earnings. Nonetheless, Netflix enjoyed a solid quarter, posting $2.1 billion in free cash flow and seeing its year-to-date operating margin moving higher to 28.1% (20.6% in FY23). The company also maintained its free cash flow outlook of $6 billion for FY24 and repurchased 3.6 million shares throughout the period. Earnings expectations have moved higher following the release, a bullish near-term sign. Netflix is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The company's growth outlook remains bright, with consensus expectations for its current fiscal year suggesting 50% earnings growth on 15% higher sales. The stock sports a Style Score of 'A' for Growth. Meta Platforms"
"Walmart, Target, Amazon and Nvidia are part of Zacks Earnings Preview","Chicago, IL – May 20, 2024 – Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week’s list includes Walmart’s WMT, Target TGT, Amazon AMZN and Nvidia NVDA. Walmart’s beat-and-raise quarterly release should ordinarily provide favorable read-throughs for Target, which is scheduled to report results before the market’s open on Wednesday, May 22nd. But the two companies have different business models, and that makes expectations off target. To start, Walmart has effectively added a technological component to its well-established reputation for value. Walmart’s digital prowess has allowed it to offer a variety of convenient shopping options, allowing it to gain market share, with mostly high-income households finding the company’s service offerings hard to resist. The company’s revenues in the quarter increased +5.8% (in constant currency), with digital sales up +21% from the same period last year. Another major point of distinction between the two retailers is their merchandise mix, with Walmart heavily weighted towards groceries and Target towards discretionary merchandise. Walmart enjoyed mid-single-digit same-store sales growth in the latest quarter, with the aforementioned high-income households attracted to the retailer for its convenient delivery and pick-up options. Walmart’s general merchandise, which can roughly be considered comparable to the bulk of Target’s merchandise mix, continued to show soft results, with same-store sales down in the low single digits in the quarter. Most analysts expect Target to show low single-digit same-store sales declines but also expect some sequential improvement in the trend line Target is expected to bring in $2.05 in EPS on $24.5 billion in revenues, with earnings unchanged from the year-ago period on -3.2% lower revenues. The stock was up big following each of the last two quarterly releases in March and November, as can be seen in the one-year performance chart below relative to Walmart and the Zacks Retail sector. With respect to the Retail sector 2024 Q1 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 23 of the 34 retailers in the S&P 500 index. Regular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, which is unlike the placement of the space in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard & Poor’s standard industry classification. The Zacks Retail sector includes not only Walmart, Target, and other traditional retailers, but also online vendors like Amazon and restaurant players. Total Q1 earnings for these 23 retailers that have reported are up +38.7% from the same period last year on +6.4% higher revenues, with 69.6% beating EPS estimates and 56.5% beating revenue estimates. Walmart beat both EPS and revenue estimates, but Home Depot missed on revenues. Aside from these two ‘conventional’ retailers, the scorecard at this stage primarily reflects the Q1 performance of the digital players and restaurant operators. As the above beats data shows, these companies have struggled to beat EPS and revenue estimates in Q1."
"Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Amazon, Meta, Alphabet and Apple","Chicago, IL – May 17, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Amazon AMZN, Meta Platforms META, Alphabet GOOGL and Apple AAPL. It’s been a long road back to new highs for many tech companies. While several of the Magnificent 7 stocks already eclipsed their former highs, one recently broke out in conjunction with the broader Nasdaq Composite index. One of the largest e-commerce companies in the world, Amazon maintains a strong position in the online retail marketplace, backed by its Prime membership with ultrafast delivery services. The company has diversified into a host of other categories and is now the leading provider of cloud infrastructure as a service to enterprise customers with its Amazon Web Services (AWS) offering. An expanding global presence and growing capabilities in areas such as generative AI, health care, grocery, and autonomous driving are major tailwinds for Amazon moving forward. Amazon, currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is benefitting from underlying momentum in both retail and technology sectors. Shares are displaying relative strength as buying pressure accumulates in this market leader. The company is part of the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry group, which currently ranks in the top 36% out of more than 250 Zacks Ranked Industries. Because it is ranked in the top half of all Zacks Ranked Industries, we expect this group to outperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months. This group is widely outperforming the market over the past year. Historical research studies suggest that approximately half of a stock’s price appreciation is due to its industry grouping. In fact, the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. It’s no secret that investing in stocks that are part of leading industry groups can give us a leg up relative to the market. By focusing on leading stocks within the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries, we can dramatically improve our stock-picking success. Amazon's financial prowess is undeniable, with its first-quarter results propelled by Prime and AWS. Earlier in May, the tech behemoth delivered adjusted Q1 earnings of $1.13/share, a 264% jump from the year-ago period. The figure topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 36.1%. Net revenues of $143.31 billion during the quarter rose 13% year-over-year. Growing momentum in AWS, expanding investments in generative AI, as well as strength in its advertising business contributed to the upbeat results."
Is AMD Stealing the Spotlight in Server and Client Markets? Here's What You Need to Know,"Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) increased its market share for client and server categories in the x86 processor market. Despite intense competition in the market, particularly between AMD and Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC), AMD continued to grow. Intel, however, made gains in the Internet of Things (IoT) sector. Excluding IoT and semi-custom products such as game console chips that AMD manufactures, Venture Beat cites Mercury Research. Also Read: AMD Positions for AI Leadership with Expanded Portfolio, Quadrupled R&D Investment Ahead of Major Computex Announcements The company again recorded gains in both client and server segments quarterly and yearly. Dean McCarron of Mercury Research noted that x86 processor shipments aligned with typical seasonal trends in the first quarter, ending March 31, with all segments seeing moderate declines, which is typical for this time of year. This past quarter marked the first normal market results across desktop, mobile, and server segments since early 2020 when the COVID pandemic began. However, IoT/SoC processor shipments fell significantly due to decreased console demand, impacting AMD’s SoC shipments. AMD reported a 48% drop in gaming revenue in the first quarter compared to the previous year and anticipated further declines throughout 2024. McCarron explained that the statistics and share movements from the past few quarters better reflect how suppliers managed their inventory corrections. Most comparisons should be valid by the third quarter of 2024, although the year-on-year results are not. For the all-inclusive share, which includes PC client CPUs, servers, IoT, and semi-custom products like gaming consoles, Intel gained 2.4 percentage points over the quarter, driven by AMD’s reduced SoC business. Analysts flagged AMD’s significant gains in the server CPU market and its successful market share capture in the merchant accelerator sector with the Mi300 series, making it a formidable competitor to Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the merchant accelerators market. They also flagged the untapped potential of revenue synergies from the acquisition of Xilinx, suggesting a long-term upside of over $10 billion. Meanwhile, after Arm Holdings Plc’s (NASDAQ:ARM) recent quarterly print, analysts flagged the British chipmaker’s ability to displace Intel and AMD as a critical beneficiary of AI adoption at the edge (phones, PCs) and traditional x86 in data center server CPU infrastructure."
"Google wants judge, not jury, to decide upcoming antitrust case in Virginia","Google on Thursday asked that a judge, rather than a jury, decide whether it violated U.S. antitrust laws by building a monopoly on the technology that powers online advertising. To bolster its case, the tech giant wrote a multimillion-dollar check to the U.S. government that it says renders moot the government's best argument for demanding a jury trial. The antitrust case set to go before a jury in Alexandria, Virginia, in September is one of two major lawsuits the Justice Department has brought against Google. While the Virginia case focuses on advertising technology, an ongoing case in the District of Columbia focuses on Google's dominance as a search engine. Both sides in the D.C. case have presented evidence and made closing arguments. A judge there will decide whether Google violated the law. Google wants a judge to decide the merits of the case in Virginia, as well. The company argues in court papers filed Thursday that it's unprecedented for a jury to decide a federal antitrust case brought by the government. It says that this case in particular involves ""a complicated, intricate technology ecosystem, which DOJ has acknowledged to this Court is ‘highly technical, often abstract, and outside the everyday knowledge of most prospective jurors.’” A Department of Justice spokesperson did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment Thursday evening. Google, based in Mountain View, California, makes two primary arguments for striking the government's demand for a jury trial. For starters, Google argues that the constitutional right to a jury trial does not apply to a civil suit brought by the government. The right to a jury trial, based in the Bill of Rights, “protects citizens against the federal government, not the other way around,” Google's lawyers write in their court filing. The company acknowledges in the court papers, though, that the Justice Department has a stronger argument for demanding a jury in a case where it seeks monetary damages, as opposed to merely seeking equitable relief, like forcing Google to sell off parts of its advertising technology. In the Virginia case, the Department of Justice seeks monetary damages on behalf of federal agencies, including the Army, that it says were harmed by Google's monopolistic practices and overpaid for online ads that they purchased."

EXPLAINER-What risks do advanced AI models pose in the wrong hands?,"(Adds link, Microsoft ban on state-backed hacking groups using its AI products in paragraph 22) By Alexandra Alper WASHINGTON, May 9 (Reuters) - The Biden administration is poised to open up a new front in its effort to safeguard U.S. AI from China and Russia with preliminary plans to place guardrails around the most advanced AI models, Reuters reported on Wednesday. Government and private sector researchers worry U.S. adversaries could use the models, which mine vast amounts of text and images to summarize information and generate content, to wage aggressive cyber attacks or even create potent biological weapons. Here are some threats posed by AI: DEEPFAKES AND MISINFORMATION Deepfakes - realistic yet fabricated videos created by AI algorithms trained on copious online footage - are surfacing on social media, blurring fact and fiction in the polarized world of U.S. politics. While such synthetic media has been around for several years, it's been turbocharged over the past year by a slew of new ""generative AI"" tools such as Midjourney that make it cheap and easy to create convincing deepfakes. Image creation tools powered by artificial intelligence from companies including OpenAI and Microsoft, can be used to produce photos that could promote election or voting-related disinformation, despite each having policies against creating misleading content, researchers said in a report in March. Some disinformation campaigns simply harness the ability of AI to mimic real news articles as a means of disseminating false information. While major social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube have made efforts to prohibit and remove deepfakes, their effectiveness at policing such content varies. For example, last year, a Chinese government-controlled news site using a generative AI platform pushed a previously circulated false claim that the United States was running a lab in Kazakhstan to create biological weapons for use against China, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said in its 2024 homeland threat assessment."
Sony Had A Good Q4 Game But It Needs To Figure Out How To Evolve Beyond PlayStation,"On Tuesday, Sony Group Corporation (NYSE: SONY) reported its fourth quarter results. Sony’s net profit grew from stronger earnings that were generated by its gaming and move business. For the three months that ended in March,  Sony reported revenue grew 13% YoY to 3.481 trillion yen, while net profit rose 34% YoY to 189.005 billion yen which is about $1.21 billion. The gaming business reported that operating profit more than doubled to 105.98 billion yen, while the movie business followed with a nearly doubled operating profit of 30.67 billion yen. For the fiscal year, Sony sold 20.8 million units of PlayStation 5, which is more than 19.1 million units it sold during the previous fiscal year. Like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Sony annoucned it will be laying off about 900 employees from its PlayStation business in response to the videogame industry’s struggles to regain its vigor in a post-pandemic reality. Back in October, Microsoft laid off about 8% of its videogaming workforce. Even GameStop Corporation (NYSE: GME) also announced job cuts. Moreover, the videogame retailer’s stock plummeted on Friday as meme-stock mania faded. GameStop reported preliminary first quarter results and they showed a first quarter drop in sales. GameStop expects first quarter sales to range between $872 million to $892 million while it reported $1.24 billion during last year’s comparable quarter. But, GameStop is also expecting to narrow down its net loss from last year’s $50.5 million to somewhere between $27 million and $37 million. The Japanese entertainment and electronics company plans to spin off its financial business, which is why it guided for a revenue drop of 5.5% to 12.310 trillion yen and a net profit decline of 4.7% to 925 billion yen. However, Sony guided for its game business operating profit to continue to rise at 6.8% to 310 billion yen. Sony also expects its movie business profits to rise 2% to 120 billion yen. Sony and Microsoft rivalry will live on, but there’s bigger fish to fry. Both for Sony and its rival Microsoft, findings ways to grow revenue is more important than winning the console war. Microsoft undoubtedly upleveled its game by acquiring Activision Blizzard but console wars are becoming less and less relevant as both Microsoft and Sony need to figure out how to evolve in the new gaming era that is in the making.

"Dell deepens AI push with new PCs, Nvidia-powered servers","By Jaspreet Singh and Arsheeya Bajwa (Reuters) -Dell Technologies unveiled a range of AI-enabled PCs powered by Qualcomm processors and said a new server which supports Nvidia's latest chips will be available from the second half of 2024. Dell made the announcements at an event in Las Vegas on Monday, aiming to maintain momentum in the lucrative market for artificial intelligence servers and bracing for an expected recovery in the PC market this year after a post-pandemic slump in orders. Its AI-capable PCs will come with the Qualcomm Snapdragon X series chips that feature neural processing units(NPUs) dedicated to processing complex AI tasks. Two of the five new PCs can be pre-ordered starting Monday, with the rest to be made available in the coming months. The launch comes on the same day as that of Microsoft's annual Build event, where Chief Executive Satya Nadella introduced the so-called ""Copilot+"" PCs, counting Dell, Qualcomm, Intel and Advanced Micro Devices among the partners that would help build them. Qualcomm's shares rose close to 2% to hit a record high while Dell's shares were down about 2.6%. AI SERVER BOOM Dell on Monday also launched the latest in its line of servers compatible with Nvidia's Blackwell chips. The new server also offers liquid cooling technology, as opposed to air cooling, which tends to consume more power. Arthur Lewis, president of the company's infrastructure solutions group, told Reuters in an interview that Dell's Nvidia-based servers were the fastest ramping product in its history."
Wall Street bets on stellar quarterly results from Nvidia,"By Arsheeya Bajwa (Reuters) -Wall Street is betting on a blowout quarterly report from Nvidia on Wednesday, with its stock near record highs as investors look for evidence that the AI chipmaker can maintain its explosive growth and stay ahead of rivals. The results will be the latest test for Wall Street's picks-and-shovels trade that has turned Nvidia into the biggest winner of the generative AI boom, thanks to its chips that are essential in powering technology such as Google's Gemini to OpenAI's ChatGPT. ""There is a lot riding on Nvidia's earnings. It is the most important stock in the sector,"" said Will Rhind, founder and CEO of GraniteShares, which runs an ETF that invests in the chip firm. A more than six-fold surge in its shares since the start of 2023 has made Nvidia Wall Street's third-most valuable firm, worth more than $2.30 trillion. Its 89% stock surge so far in 2024 has helped lift the broader market, and Nvidia now accounts for 5% of the S&P 500, according to LSEG data. Analyst expectations for Nvidia's future earnings have climbed even faster than its shares. That last left the stock trading at about 35 times expected earnings, down from a peak of over 80 last June, according to LSEG data. Nvidia's staggering valuation might yet have room to grow. ""It is undervalued relative to where forecasts are going,"" Rhind said. Analysts on average see Nvidia reporting a 242% jump in revenue to $24.60 billion for the fiscal quarter ending in April, according to LSEG data as of May 17. Its sales in the second quarter are expected to rise almost 97%, the data showed. Analysts see it reporting net income of $12.83 billion in the first quarter, up from $2.04 billion a year ago."

Mag 7 stocks including Apple and Amazon still holding strong,"The ""Magnificent Seven"" accounted for around two-thirds of the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gains last year, but can they repeat those extraordinary returns this time around? Profits for the ""Mag 7"" are forecast to rise 38% in the first quarter from a year ago, dwarfing the overall S&P 500’s 2.4% anticipated year-over-year earnings growth, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data. This group of mega-cap tech companies — Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) — are capitalising on tech growth trends such as artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing. In 2023, Magnificent Seven stocks surged between 48% and 239%, accounting for some 60% of last year's 24% total return for the S&P 500. Here’s how the mega caps performed this first quarter and what Nvidia is expected to deliver when it reports next week. Tesla reported a 9% drop in first-quarter revenue, the biggest decline since 2012, and missed analysts’ estimates, as the electric vehicle company weathers the effect of ongoing price cuts. The electric vehicle (EV) maker said it had made $1.13bn (£910m) over the first three months of the year, compared with $2.51bn a year earlier. CEO Elon Musk said on the call that the company plans to start production of new models in “early 2025, if not late this year,” after previously expecting to begin in the second half of 2025. Read more: Trending tickers: Anglo American, GameStop, Vodafone, Greggs and Novavax “We slightly raised our 2024 deliveries forecast, versus our prior forecast for no growth. Our improved outlook is due to Tesla’s recent price cuts, so we also slightly reduced our near-term automotive gross margin forecast. We think Tesla could cut prices further as management aims to pass along the majority of cost savings to customers to drive demand,” said Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein."
Time for Cloud ETFs on Earnings Strength & Promising Growth?,"Cloud computing has been at the forefront of the growth in technology for the past few years, offering efficient solutions for businesses and consumers. The global cloud computing market is expected to grow from $626.4 billion in 2023 to $1.27 billion by 2028 at a CAGR of 15.1%, per MarketsandMarkets. The widespread adoption of remote work and e-commerce has continued to fuel the need for scalable and reliable cloud solutions. Moreover, advancements in cloud technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and cybersecurity enhancements, have expanded the use cases for cloud services, attracting a broader customer base. The global cloud computing market is led by three mega cloud service providers — Microsoft, Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services. The total cloud infrastructure market was worth $76 billion worldwide at the end of Q1 of 2024, which marked a year-over-year rise of 21%. According to recent data from Synergy Research Group cited on CRN, AWS, Microsoft and Google collectively managed a 67% share of the $76 billion global cloud infrastructure services market in the first quarter of 2024. Google-parent Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT and Amazon AMZN recently reported their quarterly financial cloud numbers for the first quarter of 2024. Each company logged record quarterly cloud sales thanks to double-digit growth rates. Combined, these three cloud leaders generated more than $61 billion in total sales in the first quarter of 2024. Their cloud units, in fact, boosted total revenue growth as clients are increasingly adopting AI services. Growth rates are rebounding from the relative lows seen through most of 2023. Individually, Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud business generated $26.7 billion in total sales (up 21% year over year) during the quarter, meaning Microsoft’s cloud group now has a run rate of $107 billion. AWS generated just over $25 billion in revenues (up 17% year over year). This means Amazon’s cloud business now has an annual run rate of $100 billion. Google Cloud reported total sales of $9.6 billion (up 28% year over year). This shows that Alphabet’s cloud business currently has an annual run rate of $38.4 billion. In terms of global market share, AWS is leading (with a 31% share), followed by Microsoft (25%) and Google (11%). Other cloud market-share leaders of the first quarter included Alibaba BABA at 4% market share and Salesforce CRM at 3% cloud share."

Amazon stock pops after earnings beat,"Amazon (AMZN) reported first quarter earnings that topped Wall Street estimates on the top and bottom lines, sending shares of the retail giant up around 3% in morning trading Wednesday. Powered by a strong showing from its cloud computing segment, Amazon continued a wave of Big Tech results that have mostly wowed Wall Street even as investors turn their focus to the conclusion of the Fed's May policy meeting on Wednesday. Net sales rose 13% from the same period last year to $143.3 billion, Amazon reported late Tuesday, topping analyst expectations of $142.6 billion, per Bloomberg data.

""We're encouraged by the discipline on the top line."" pic.twitter.com/C7Y2pG9Tvt — Yahoo Finance (@YahooFinance) May 1, 2024 Like its competitors Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon is wielding its heft in its cloud computing business to gain an edge in the nascent AI market. AI tools require huge amounts of data and processing power to train and run large language models and their applications, relying on cloud providers to supply vital infrastructure. Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky said on a call with reporters following the report that overall capital expenditures are expected to ""meaningfully"" increase this year from nearly $50 billion in 2023, driven by higher infrastructure costs to support growth in AWS. Amazon is seeing strong demand on the AWS side, with customers signing up for longer deals with bigger commitments, many with generative AI components, he said. Advertising was another strong contributor to Q1 revenue growth. The company matched analyst expectations of $11.8 billion, up 24% from the same period last year."

"Trending tickers: Chubb, Nvidia, Microsoft, BT and EasyJet","Shares in the Swiss insurer surged in pre-market trading after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) disclosed a major stake in the company. Berkshire revealed it acquired nearly 26 million shares of Chubb in a Wednesday Securities and Exchange Commission filing of the company’s first-quarter investments. That translates to a value of approximately $6.7bn (£5.28bn). Berkshire had requested confidential treatment from the Securities and Exchange Commission in the third and fourth quarter of last year for one or more of its equity holdings. The treatment was sought presumably because Buffett wanted to accumulate Chubb without tipping off other investors and potentially boosting the price of Chubb shares. ""Chubb is an attractive equity investment for Berkshire because it operates in a business Berkshire knows well: property-casualty insurance,"" Cathy Seifert, a CFRA Research analyst who covers Berkshire, said in an email reported by Reuters. The company led by the ‘Oracle of Omaha’ also announced it was eliminating its stake in HP (HPQ). Shares in the chipmaker were higher in pre-market trading after KeyBanc Capital Markets said it sees limited signs of a demand pause for the company. This comes ahead of Nvidia's first-quarter results next week. Consensus expectations on Wall Street are for Nvidia to report revenue of $24.51bn. But to avoid disappointing investors, KeyBanc analyst John Vinh said, the chipmaker will need to report revenue of around $26bn and give guidance for its second quarter of around $28.5bn.

Biden to unveil $3.3 billion Microsoft AI investment in battleground Wisconsin,"* New data center to be built on site of failed Foxconn investment * Microsoft aims to create 2,000 permanent jobs * Wisconsin is one of seven battleground states in 2024 election By Andrea Shalal WASHINGTON, May 8 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden will visit the political battleground state of Wisconsin on Wednesday to announce plans by Microsoft Corp to build a $3.3 billion high-tech data center that will create thousands of jobs, the White House said. The Microsoft facility in Racine County, in southeastern Wisconsin, will be built on the same land where Taiwan electronics manufacturer Foxconn had planned to build a $10 billion factory that former President Donald Trump once called ""the eighth wonder of the world,"" before Foxconn drastically scaled back its plans. Microsoft's plans will result in 2,300 union construction jobs and some 2,000 permanent jobs over time, the White House said. It said nearly 4,000 jobs had been added in Racine since Biden took office, while about 1,000 manufacturing jobs were lost during the Trump administration."
Biden makes a Wisconsin stop to tout AI — and troll Trump's Foxconn flop,"President Biden made a trip to the swing state of Wisconsin on Wednesday with two goals. First, he was there to formally unveil a new $3.3 billion investment by Microsoft in artificial intelligence in the state. But a second clear priority was to highlight the failure of one of Donald Trump’s biggest jobs promises from his time in office. Microsoft’s (MSFT) forthcoming AI data center — as Biden was more than happy to point out repeatedly — is being built on land that was cleared during the Trump administration for a planned $10 billion Foxconn investment. The land was then abandoned when the Foxconn project was scaled way back. Trump talked a lot about infrastructure and jobs but ""didn’t build a damn thing,"" Biden said as he took the stage Wednesday afternoon, adding: ""Foxconn turned out to be just that, a con."" ""On my watch, we make promises and we keep promises,"" he added later, just in case anyone missed the message. Biden spoke at Gateway Technical College in Sturtevant, Wisc., in the afternoon before heading to campaign events elsewhere in Wisconsin and Chicago. Wednesday’s speech also offered some insights into Biden’s potential approach to the key issue of AI in the years ahead. ""We are going to build something special,"" Microsoft president Brad Smith said before Biden took the stage. He added what was perhaps a dig at Foxconn, saying, ""One thing that I’ve always felt is so important about the work we are doing here is to underpromise, overdeliver, and work with the community."" Smith said Biden’s policies — notably the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the CHIPs and Science Act — helped make the company’s Wisconsin investment possible."

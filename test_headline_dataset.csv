Should F5 (FFIV) be in Your Portfolio Ahead of Q2 Earnings?,"F5, Inc. FFIV, a multi-cloud application services and security company, is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2024 results after market close on Apr 29. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 5.3%. F5 projects non-GAAP revenues in the $675-$695 million band (midpoint of $685 million) and non-GAAP earnings per share in the $2.79-$2.91 band (midpoint of $2.85) for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for F5’s second-quarter earnings has been revised upward by a penny to $2.88 per share over the past 30 days and indicates an improvement of 13.8% from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of $2.53. The consensus mark for revenues stands at $686.9 million, which calls for a 2.3% decrease from the year-ago quarter. In the last reported quarter, FFIV’s non-GAAP earnings of $3.43 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 40 cents and came 39% higher than the year-ago quarter’s $2.47 per share. Revenues of $693 million beat the consensus mark of $687.1 million but declined 1% on a year-over-year basis. Despite facing headwinds in recent quarters, FFIV has shown resilience and remains a dominant player in the networking and application delivery space. With F5 gearing up to report its Q2 earnings, let’s evaluate whether now is the right time to buy this networking giant. F5, Inc. price-eps-surprise | F5, Inc. Quote F5 is one of the major players in the application delivery controller (ADC) market, offering vital products for data center consolidation, virtualization and cloud services. Additionally, F5 has gained significant market share due to Cisco's shift away from the core ADC market. It is also a major developer and provider of software-defined application services, ensuring secure, speedy and accessible applications across IP networks on any device and at any time. F5 stands out to benefit from the booming application networking market. With a strong hold in Layer 4-7 content switching and a solid position in data centers, the company is poised to expand market share, especially given the increasing demand for capacity and security in next-gen applications. The growing demand for cloud-based applications, digital transformation and cybersecurity solutions bodes well for F5's long-term growth prospects. As organizations increasingly rely on application delivery and security services to support their digital initiatives, FFIV stands to benefit from these trends. While F5's financial performance in recent quarters has been mixed, with revenues and earnings fluctuating due to macroeconomic factors and industry dynamics, the company's resilient business model and cost optimization efforts have helped mitigate some of these challenges."
"5 big analyst AI moves: Baidu, Accenture downgraded to Hold","Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week. InvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today! Analysts at the investment bank RBC Capital Markets raised their target price on Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock from $450 to $500 on Friday, citing positive feedback from their recent investor meetings with Microsoft's Directors of Investor Relations. RBC stressed that AI remains a key growth driver for Microsoft, highlighting that the tech giant continues to make substantial investments in this rapidly developing sector. “While CapEx will likely continue to ramp and impact margins, Microsoft is following demand signals and is simultaneously focused on bringing the cost curve down,” analysts said in the note. “Advances like GPT-4o, which is more efficient, and Maia (custom AI silicon) will help drive down the cost curve,” they added. RBC also emphasized Microsoft's expertise in cloud services as a major advantage, providing a unified architecture for all AI workloads. Moreover, RBC noted that while Microsoft's core cloud business is still in its early stages, there is a clear trend of companies moving more workloads to the cloud. Azure's growth, excluding AI, has accelerated in the fiscal Q2, they noted. “Importantly, core Azure is benefiting from the broader AI roadmap, as one-third of the 50K+ Azure AI customers are net new to Azure,” analysts noted."
"Trending tickers: Apple, Reddit, JD Wetherspoon, Toyota and ARM","Shares in Apple were basically flat in premarket trading as analysts appeared to be unphased by the launch of a line of new iPad tablets revamped with a powerful AI chip that signalled the company is ready to introduce artificial intelligence across its devices. The iPad Pro now includes the cutting-edge M4 chip. This offers a glimpse into Apple's vision for integrating artificial intelligence capabilities into its devices. The Cupertino-based company has been criticised for going too slow on the AI revolution as Microsoft (MSFT) pipped its spot as the world's biggest company by market capitalisation. It is reportedly working on creating its own artificial intelligence chips for the company's data centres in a new project called ""ACDC."" Read more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European stocks rise as pound slips ahead of Bank of England decision this week ""In my opinion, this is more about improving the costs for AI for Apple than it is necessarily a new product release leveraging artificial intelligence,"" Maxim Group Managing Director Tom Forte, told Yahoo Finance. He added that despite the chip's potential to cut artificial intelligence operating costs, ""I certainly wouldn't consider changing my hold rating on the news."" Reddit released its first quarter earnings report following its March IPO, revealing that revenue increased 48% to $243m (£194.8). Shares soared by 14% in premarket trading. The company reported $222.7m in ad revenue for the period, up 39% year over year. Average daily active users jumped 37% to a record 82.7 million. For the second quarter, Reddit expects revenue of $240m to $255m, topping the $224 million expected by analysts, according to LSEG. The midpoint of the guidance range suggests growth of about 32% for the second quarter, up from $183m from a year earlier."
"Alphabet market cap tops $2 trillion after earnings beat, dividend announcement","Google parent Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) market cap surpassed $2 trillion on Friday following standout quarterly results that beat revenue and earnings estimates and the announcement of a cash dividend program of $0.20 per share. The board of directors also approved stock repurchases of up to an additional $70 billion. “Our results in the first quarter reflect strong performance from Search, YouTube and Cloud,"" said CEO Sundar Pichai in a statement on Thursday. ""Our leadership in AI research and infrastructure, and our global product footprint, position us well for the next wave of AI innovation.” The company's market cap stood at $2.15 trillion in early afternoon trading on Friday. Alphabet stock was up roughly 10% during the session. Revenue, excluding traffic acquisition costs, rose 16% from the same period last year to $67.59 billion, beating analyst expectations of $66.07 billion, per Bloomberg data. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.89 versus consensus estimates of $1.53. In artificial intelligence, Google has widely been seen as playing catch up to Microsoft (MSFT), which was among the first in the tech world to reap the cultural excitement around consumer AI chatbots. Microsoft invested in OpenAI, the company behind the popular ChatGPT. But Google executives emphasized during the earnings call Thursday that the company is well positioned to lead the shift to an AI-centric tech world, and that it is committed to investments that will fuel the development of new models. Pichai said the company has clear paths to monetize AI breakthroughs through advertising, cloud, and subscriptions. He also touted the integration of AI tools into Google search, which allows users to ask more complex and descriptive questions. But how AI will influence Google’s search business remains unclear, since new AI-based interfaces might displace traditional search and change the way users interact with the Web."
Amazon unveils first electric seaport trucks amid push to slash tailpipe emissions,"By Lisa Baertlein LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -Amazon.com on Tuesday unveiled the first of a dozen Volvo electric big rigs it plans to deploy this year to pick up cargo from the nation's busiest container seaport in Southern California. The e-commerce giant already has eight of those semi trucks in use at the Los Angeles/Long Beach port complex, where every so-called drayage truck must be zero-emissions by 2035. The deployment is a first for Amazon, extending its vehicle electrification projects from ocean ports to customer doorsteps. The effort is vital to the company's push to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040. So far, a little more than 1% of the 23,761 trucks that serve the Los Angeles/Long Beach port complex are zero-emission vehicles - including 201 electric rigs, Long Beach port spokesman Lee Peterson said. ""Heavy-duty trucking is a particularly difficult area to decarbonize,"" said Udit Madan, Amazon's vice president of worldwide operations. The company has rolled out more than 13,500 Rivian electric cargo delivery vans across the country since 2022. The transition to electric semi trucks will be a bigger lift, because they haul heavier loads and their batteries require more intensive charging infrastructure. ""There is no playbook,"" said Adam Baker, vice president of global logistics for Amazon. For now, the company is gathering data on battery performance that will help determine how many trucks will be needed. The manufacturer of Amazon's electric drayage trucks will continue working with the company and JAB Hunt, which provides drivers for the rigs, throughout the deployment, said Keith Brandis, vice president of partnerships and system solutions at Volvo Trucks North America. ""Charging infrastructure is the long pole in the tent. We have to get that right,"" Brandis said."
"Amazon to invest $1.3 billion in France, create 3,000 jobs","By Supantha Mukherjee STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Amazon said on Monday it would invest more than 1.2 billion euros ($1.3 billion) in its French operations and create more than 3,000 permanent jobs in the country. The French presidency had said on Sunday that Amazon and other companies, including GSK and Accenture, would announce investments worth billions as part of the country's annual ""Choose France"" event, which begins on Monday. Amazon Web Services' (AWS) investment would increase cloud infrastructure in the Paris area to support France's flourishing generative AI opportunity, and logistics infrastructure in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region, the company said in a statement. Increased popularity of GenAI has been fuelling demand for cloud services, and France has become a hub for AI, with promising startups such as Mistral and Poolside. Companies such as Meta and Google have set up AI research centres in the country. Amazon has invested more than 20 billion euros in its French operations since 2010 and employs more than 22,000 permanent employees across its cloud and online retail businesses. ""These jobs are in addition to the 2,000 jobs we announced for 2024,"" said Frédéric Duval, country manager at Amazon France. A part of the investment would also be used to expand its logistics network to increase speed of delivery and reduce carbon emissions. It has more than 35 logistics facilities in France.

Amazon's Smashing Q1 Financials Show The Power Of A Good And Well Executed Strategy,"Like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), Snap Inc (NYSE: SNAP) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL),  Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) reported better-than-expected quarterly results, with stronger than expected revenue being the result of the improvements on the ad business front. In part due to its booming AWS division and its advertising service, Amazon reported revenue grew 12.52% YoY to $143.3 billion, surpassing LSEG’s estimate of $142.5 billion. Operating income far outpaced revenue growth as well as it soared more than 200% to $15.3 billion, which is the first sign that Amazon’s cost-cutting initiatives and efficiency improvements are benefiting the bottom line as net income skyrocketed 229% YoY to $10.43 billion, with diluted EPS amounting to 98 cents a share, surpassing LSEG’s estimate of 83 cents. Amazon’s businesses are thriving, beginning with party seller services that cover commissions that Amazon collects, along with fulfillment, shipping fees and other charges, grew 16% YoY to $34.5 billion. AWS continues to grow and challenge Google and Microsoft, both the cloud and AI front. The AWS division reported a 17% YoY growth to $25 billion, surpassing StreetAccount’s estimate of $24.5 billion and reflecting Amazon’s strong positioning compared to its AI rivals, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), who secured a leadership position with its early entry and OpenAI acquisition, and Alphabet, with the latter finally catching up to its peers in their efforts to lead the way into the golden age of AI. AWS’ actions could spell trouble for Alphabet and Microsoft as Jassy revealed significant investments over the next few years to build new infrastructure and data centers. Amazon will be investing $5.3 billion in Saudi Arabia and $5 billion in Mexico to build new infrastructure centers, along with $10 billion in Mississippi to build two data centers that are projected to create at least 1,000 jobs. Advertising continues to grow, becoming an increasingly important profit driver. Advertising revenue grew 24% to $11.8 billion, outpacing both retail and cloud computing growth, as well as StreetAccount’s estimate of $11.7 billion. This is the first report since Amazon introduced ads in Prime Video, which analysts expect to generate significant revenue over time. Despite being new to the ad business, Amazon has emerged as one of the big players in the online advertising arena. CEO Andy Jassy has made it clear that the e-commerce and cloud titan will continue to focus on its ad efforts, as it plans include more of its sponsored content on its Prime Video platform. First quarter results across the board show that online ads have rebounded. Last week, Alphabet also announced its ad business reaccelerated after a tough 2022 and 2023. Google reported total ad sales rose from last year’s comparable quarter, when they amounted to $54.55 billion, to $61.66 billion. Amazon expects profitability growth to continue in the current quarter but at a more measured pace as it guided for an operating income between $10 billion and $14 billion, on the back of revenue in the range between $144 billion to $149 billion, translating to revenue growth in the range between 7% and 11%."
"The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Alphabet, Netflix, Amazon, ServiceNow and Boston Scientific","Chicago, IL – May 7, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Netflix Inc. NFLX, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, ServiceNow Inc. NOW and Boston Scientific Corp. BSX. The 15-month bull run of U.S. stock markets suffered a surprise setback in April. The Dow plunged 5%, marking its worst monthly performance since September 2022. The S&P 500 slid 4.2% and the Nasdaq Composite tumbled 4.4%. All three major stock indexes terminated a five-month winning streak. April is historically known as being favorable to Wall Street investors. We believe April's meltdown is nothing but a bull market correction and this time a welcome one. After a disappointing month, May opens a golden opportunity to enter the equity market for those investors suffering from the FOMO (fear of missing out) syndrome. Finally, recently released economic data boosted market participants’ confidence in equities. The Department of Labor reported that the U.S. economy added 175,000 jobs in April, missing the consensus estimate of 200,000. Job additions in March were revised upward by 12,000 while those of February were revised downward by 34,000. The unemployment rate increased to 3.9% in April, compared with the consensus estimate and March’s data of 3.8%. April marked the highest level since January 2022. Moreover, real unemployment rate (including discouraged workers and those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons) edged up to 7.4%, its highest level since November 2021. The labor force participation rate was unchanged at 62.7% in April. Month over month, the average hourly earnings rate dropped to 0.2% in April, compared with the consensus estimate and March’s data of 0.3%. Year over year, the wage rate increased 3.9% in April, below the consensus estimate of 4%. The average workweek decreased to 34.3. The Department of Commerce reported that U.S. GDP grew at a 1.6% annualized rate in first-quarter 2024, well below the consensus estimate of 2.5%. Moreover, the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) reported that both manufacturing and services PMIs (purchasing managers’ index) contracted in April. The manufacturing PMI for April came in at 49.2% and that of services PMI was 49.4%. Any reading below 50% indicates contraction in activities. The manufacturing PMI expanded in March after 16 consecutive months of contraction. It again contracted in April. The services PMI contracted in April after 15 successive months of expansion. Following the release of the April’s nonfarm payrolls, the CME FedWatch shows a 67.4% probability that the central bank will cut the benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points in the September FOMC meeting. The interest rate futures tool also shows a massive 91.5% probability that the Fed will cut rate by 50 basis points. Notably, the Fed fund rate currently stays within the range of 5.25-5.5% since July 2023. On May 1, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell categorically denied the resumption of the interest rate hike regime in his post-FOMC meeting statement. Moreover, the FOMC voted to ease the pace at which it is reducing bond holdings on the central bank’s gigantic balance sheet. The Fed started this program in June 2022, which was known as “quantitative tightening.” Its latest decision could be viewed as an incremental loosening of monetary policy."
"Microsoft Shakes Up Xbox Division, Closes Renowned Studios in Major Cost-Cutting Move","Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) initiated the unplanned closure of several video-game studios within its Xbox division as part of an ongoing broad cost-cutting strategy. According to sources familiar with the plans, this week, Xbox offered voluntary severance agreements to producers, quality assurance testers, and other staff at ZeniMax, which Microsoft acquired in 2020 for $7.5 billion. Additional cuts are likely across the Xbox organization, Bloomberg reports. Employees were surprised by Tuesday’s abrupt closure of three Xbox subsidiaries and the absorption of a fourth. Among those closed was Tokyo-based Tango Gameworks, known for the acclaimed action game Hi-Fi Rush, which was pitching a sequel. Xbox president Matt Booty praised Hi-Fi Rush during a town hall meeting on Wednesday. Booty mentioned that the company’s studios had been stretched too thin and that the closures aimed to reallocate resources. Booty clarified that Arkane Austin, the developer behind Prey’s shutdown, was unrelated to the poor performance of its recent multiplayer game, Redfall. Before closing, Arkane had planned to pitch a new single-player game in the Dishonored series, Bloomberg writes. Jill Braff, head of ZeniMax studios, expressed hope that the reorganization would enable a greater focus on fewer projects, given the challenge of supporting nine studios worldwide with a lean central team. Microsoft’s gaming division has grown significantly through acquisitions, including ZeniMax and Activision Blizzard, which have been worth over $76 billion combined. The gaming sector has recently experienced extensive layoffs, with significant companies like Sony Group Corp (NYSE:SONY), Electronic Arts Inc (NASDAQ:EA), and Microsoft reducing their workforces and shuttering subsidiaries."
Biden takes aim at Trump for failed Foxconn project with visit to Microsoft’s new site in Wisconsin,"Microsoft said it is pouring $3.3 billion into building a data hub in Wisconsin that aims to train employees and manufacturers on how to best use artificial intelligence. President Joe Biden will appear at the site in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin, on Wednesday to highlight the administration’s efforts to invest in job growth in America. The news comes six years after the Trump administration announced a $10 billion investment by tech manufacturer Foxconn – with the promise to bring 13,000 jobs to the area – on the same Wisconsin land, a plan that never materialized. The new center aims to create 2,300 union construction jobs and 2,000 permanent jobs over time, according to Microsoft. Microsoft said it will use the center to train about 100,000 workers across the state on generative AI by 2030, thanks in part to a partnership with United Way Wisconsin, United Way Racine and other community partners. It also plans to open a lab on the campus of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee to help companies and manufacturers infuse the technology into their businesses. Microsoft Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella earned a master’s degree in computer science at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, according to his company profile. In his remarks Wednesday, Biden plans to directly point his finger at Trump for the failed project, according to a White House official. In a statement sent to CNN, Foxconn parent company Hon Hai Technology Group said it “continues to grow” in Wisconsin and “supports expansion of technology and innovation to the state.” Foxconn, which said it has invested about $1 billion into the state, still has a major manufacturing site for data servers in Racine County with more than 1,000 employees. It has facilities in 205 locations across 24 countries. “Employment at Foxconn Wisconsin has grown at least 42% in the three years since 2020,” the company said. “We have been Racine County’s largest taxpayer in recent years.”"

"Walmart, Target, Home Depot and Amazon are part of Zacks Earnings Preview","Chicago, IL – May 13, 2024 – Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week’s list includes Walmart WMT, Target TGT, Home Depot HD and Amazon AMZN. Walmart shares held their own in last month’s market weakness, cementing its anchoring and defensive positioning, particularly relative to Target and Home Depot. From the market’s March 28th peak through the end of April 2024, the S&P 500 index lost -3.8% of its value, while Walmart was down only -1.4%. Target lost -9.2% of its value during that same period, while Home Depot shares were down -12.9%. Walmart’s defensive attributes reflect the retailer’s heavy grocery exposure and reputation for value. Walmart’s value orientation and well-executed digital strategy have been key to gaining grocery market share by attracting higher-income households. Walmart’s growing share of higher-income grocery spending notwithstanding, the retailer still has a substantial exposure to lower-income consumers, who appear to be under increasing stress, as reflected in rising loan delinquency rates and other measures indicating strained financial health. This exposure could be a source of vulnerability for Walmart’s same-store sales in its quarterly release on Thursday, May 16th; Target reports the following week on May 22nd. Walmart is expected to report $0.52 in EPS on $159.2 billion in revenues, representing year-over-year changes of +6.1% and +4.5%, respectively. Trends in Walmart’s non-grocery business have been anemic lately, so any favorable turn in the demand trends for this relatively discretionary merchandise will be a nice offset to the aforementioned lower-income vulnerability. Any signs of life on the discretionary merchandise part will also have positive read-throughs for Target and Home Depot. Home Depot reports on Tuesday, May 14th. Target shares were up big following each of the preceding two reports, which assured investors about management’s ability on the margins and the ‘shrinkage issue’ they appeared to be struggling with over the last couple of years. Home Depot is a housing play and, as such, remains exposed to the seemingly higher-for-longer interest rate backdrop. With respect to the Retail sector 2024 Q1 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 21 of the 34 retailers in the S&P 500 index. Regular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, unlike the placement of the space in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard & Poor’s standard industry classification. The Zacks Retail sector includes not only Walmart, Target, and other traditional retailers but also online vendors like Amazon and restaurant players. The 21 Zacks Retail companies in the S&P 500 index that have reported Q1 results already belong to the e-commerce and restaurant industries. Total Q1 earnings for these 21 retailers that have reported are up +54.5% from the same period last year on +7.4% higher revenues, with 66.7% beating EPS estimates and 57.1% beating revenue estimates."

UPDATE 6-OpenAI unveils new AI model as competition heats up,"(Adds detail from OpenAI execs on what free ChatGPT users will have access to in paragraph 12) By Anna Tong and Akash Sriram May 13 (Reuters) - ChatGPT maker OpenAI said on Monday it would release a new AI model called GPT-4o, capable of realistic voice conversation and able to interact across text and image, its latest move to stay ahead in a race to dominate the emerging technology. New audio capabilities enable users to speak to ChatGPT and obtain real-time responses with no delay, as well as interrupt ChatGPT while it is speaking, both hallmarks of realistic conversations that AI voice assistants have found challenging, the OpenAI researchers showed at a livestream event. ""It feels like AI from the movies ... Talking to a computer has never felt really natural for me; now it does,"" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote in a blog post. Microsoft-backed OpenAI faces growing competition and pressure to expand the user base of ChatGPT, its popular chatbot product that wowed the world with its ability to produce human-like written content and top-notch software code. At the livestream event, OpenAI researchers showed off ChatGPT's new voice assistant capabilities. In one demo, ChatGPT used its vision and voice capabilities to talk a researcher through solving a math equation on a sheet of paper. In another demo, researchers showed the GPT-4o model's capability of real-time language translation. OpenAI's demonstrations verged on science-fiction, with ChatGPT and its interlocutor at one point engaging in coquettish banter. The OpenAI researcher told the chatbot he was in a great mood because he was demonstrating ""how useful and amazing you are."" ChatGPT responded: ""Oh stop it! You're making me blush!"""
Whole Foods CEO: The chain is investing in value and technology — with help from Amazon,"Whole Foods is trying to juggle value and quality as cautious consumers hunt for deals in the face of stubborn grocery inflation. ""We've increased the number of promotions for our customers ... as a result, we've actually seen double-digit unit growth in promotional items,"" CEO Jason Buechel told Yahoo Finance at the Milken Institute Global Conference on Tuesday. Believe it or not, it's been seven years since Amazon (AMZN) acquired Whole Foods. Cutting prices to reaccelerate same-store sales growth was a key focus for the Street at the time. Now Buechel is aiming to strike the right balance. Cost of groceries remained flat in March and is up 1.2% year over year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The April read on CPI (Consumer Price Index) is set to come out next week. ""Between commodities, labor, cost — inflation has been real,"" Buechel said. While Whole Foods shoppers, who are traditionally higher-income, are looking for cheaper prices, they aren't willing to compromise on quality, Buechel said. They care about where the product was grown, raised, and produced, which comes at a higher cost, raising a challenge for the company. ""What we need to do is make sure that we can find a point where customers are happy with the value of the product and can appreciate the work that's gone into it. At the same time, [that] our Whole Foods sales and profits [are] growing,"" he said. Whole Foods does not publicly share its results, but Buechel said his team is ""proud"" of recent growth. Doubling down on private label is another avenue for growth. Buechel said the team is investing in lower prices for its 365 lines as it looks to cater to all budgets."

Warren Buffett pays tribute to Charlie Munger on a 'tough day' for shareholders,"A new vibe at the Woodstock of capitalism. Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK-A, BRK-B) annual shareholder meeting on Saturday marked a new era for the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett. It’s the investing legend’s first without his right-hand man, Charlie Munger, who passed away on Nov. 28, 2023, just shy of his 100th birthday. While Munger’s absence is significant, his presence loomed throughout the CHI Health Center in Omaha, Nebraska. Charlie Munger’s name was among the first words uttered by Buffett as he took the stage. Buffett described Munger as the “architect of Berkshire,” and his request to shareholders to “join me in applauding Charlie” was met with cheers and a standing ovation by a crowd that included the likes of Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, Citigroup (C) CEO Jane Fraser, and Microsoft (MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates. “In terms of having a partner, I simply cannot think of a conversation I had with Charlie that he misled me,” Buffett later told the packed house. Buffett added: “In terms of managing money, there wasn’t anybody better in the world to talk to for many, many decades than Charlie.” The meeting started with a video tribute to the former vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, which included a number of Munger’s famous one-liners from prior meetings, including “I think that every time you saw the word EBITDA, you should substitute the word 'bulls***' earnings.” EBITDA is more formally known on the Street as shorthand for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Companies tend to hype the metric as a purer read on the health of the business rather than net profits. “It’s a bittersweet moment, … a tough day for a lot of people,” new Brooks Running CEO Dan Sheridan told me of Munger’s absence."
Is Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) a Buy Ahead of Q1 Earnings Announcement?,"Semiconductor giant Advanced Micro Devices AMD is set to report first-quarter earnings results on Tuesday after the close. AMD, a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), has surpassed the earnings mark in each of the last four quarters. But with shares pulling back recently amid sector weakness, is AMD a buy? AMD is expected to post a profit of $0.60/share, which would reflect a flat outcome versus the same quarter last year. Estimates for the quarter have increased 1.69% over the past 60 days. Sales are projected to have risen 1.24% to $5.42 billion. The company has delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 2.96%. The tech powerhouse faces significant hurdles including weakness in its Gaming division. The company also continues to experience significant competition from Nvidia in the GPU market. Another obstacle that was recently announced is China’s growing technological decoupling. China will keep AMD processors out of government PCs and servers moving forward in an effort to buoy domestic technology in the face of U.S.-led restrictions on exports. Earnings reactions can be extremely volatile and are based on a wide variety of factors. Our proprietary Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) calls for another earnings beat for the upcoming announcement.

Amazon reports strong 1Q results driven by its cloud-computing unit and Prime Video ad dollars,"NEW YORK (AP) — Amazon on Tuesday reported strong results for the first quarter, driven by growth in its cloud-computing unit and a new surge of advertising dollars from its Prime Video streaming service. The Seattle-based e-commerce giant said it brought in $143.31 billion in revenue in the first three months of this year, a 13% jump compared to the same period last year. Net income came out to $10.43 billion, or 98 cents per share. That soundly beat Wall Street analysts' expectations for 84 cents a share, according to FactSet. “It was a good start to the year across the business, and you can see that in both our customer experience improvements and financial results,” Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in a statement. The nation’s biggest online retailer is coming off better-than-expected results for the holiday shopping period, when it saw strong consumer spending aided by discounts and faster shipping speeds. Amazon held another discount event in late March, right before the end of the first quarter. Aside from its core retail business, Amazon said first-quarter sales in its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services. amounted to $25.04 billion, up 17% from the same period last year. Sales in the company's online advertising business also spiked 24%, partly driven by an influx of ad dollars coming from Prime Video. After years of giving Prime subscribers ad-free access to their favorite movies and TV shows, Amazon implemented a new policy in late January that lets viewers avoid ads only if they pay an additional $2.99 a month. Shares in Amazon.com Inc. rose 3% in after-hours trading. The company says it expects to post net sales between $144 billion and $149 billion during the second quarter. Analysts are expecting $150.2 billion, according to FactSet. China has built up a $170bn (£135bn) stockpile of gold after a record buying spree, in a move that has raised fears Beijing is preparing its economy for a possible conflict over Taiwan.

UPDATE 1-Alphabet kicks off product event with AI in focus,"(Recasts to reflect start of event, changes dateline to Mountain View, California) By Max A. Cherney and Jeffrey Dastin MOUNTAIN VIEW, California, May 14 (Reuters) - Google parent Alphabet kicked off a presentation on Tuesday where it is expected to show how it is building on artificial intelligence across its businesses, a day after OpenAI demonstrated a new AI model that can work with sound and images. The new AI features unveiled at the Google I/O developer event in Mountain View, California, will help investors evaluate Alphabet's progress as it races against Microsoft, OpenAI and other competitors to dominate the emerging technology. Microsoft-backed OpenAI on Monday showcased a new AI model called GPT-4o, which enables ChatGPT to respond via voice in real time and be interrupted - both hallmarks of realistic voice conversations that AI voice assistants like Google Assistant have found challenging. Shares of Alphabet were near unchanged in Tuesday's trading session. (Reporting by Max A. Cherney and Jeffrey Dastin in Mountain View, California Additional reporting by Anna Tong in San Francisco, Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru and Noel Randewich in Oakland, California Editing by Matthew Lewis) Apple’s updated iPad Air keeps everything it did right before and adds a more powerful chip and a big screen option.

Nvidia and Peabody Energy have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,"Chicago, IL – May 15, 2024 – Zacks Equity Research shares Nvidia NVDA as the Bull of the Day and Peabody Energy BTU as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Walmart Inc. WMT, The TJX Companies TJX and Ollie's Bargain Outlet Holdings, Inc. OLLI. Here is a synopsis of all five stocks. Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock Nvidia is the global leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. Though Nvidia has been growing for years due to revenue streams from PC graphics and gaming and virtual reality (VR) platforms, the company has experienced exploding, “hockey stick” like growth for its artificial intelligence (AI) solutions that support high-performance computing (HPC). Revenue from Nvidia’s complex and powerful chips has lifted NVDA to a more than $2 trillion market cap and has solidified the company as the undisputed leader in the AI space, far ahead of semiconductor competitors like Inteland Advanced Micro Devices. Though Nvidia is already the dominant player in the AI space, visionary CEO Jensen Huang is not sitting back and enjoying the success. Instead, NVDA recently announced the Blackwell platform, “enabling organizations everywhere to build and run real-time generative AI on trillion-parameter large language models at up to 25x less cost and energy consumption than its predecessor.”  As mega-cap tech companies race to AI dominance, large language models like Open AI and Microsoft’sChatGPT will require efficiency for two reasons. First, large language models like ChatGPT require GPUs to “train” their models. Presently, companies like OpenAI and Alphabetare engaged in an AI arms race. Furthermore, by 2030 the data center share of electricity will be the equivalent of the electricity consumption of one-third of U.S. homes (which explains the recent bull trends in utility stocks like Vistra. Earnings, which have already been growing like a weed, are expected to increase by a triple-digit clip over the next two quarters and juicy 84.72% next year. Price is the ultimate “tell” in investing because it represents real supply and demand. From this standpoint, Nvidia is bullish for two reasons: Relative Strength: While some AI-related stocks like Arm Holdingsand Super Micro Computerare well off their 52-week highs, NVDA is suffering a mild correction and is within 10% of its all-time high – a sign of relative strength. Shakeout + Regain of 10-week MA: If investing were easy, everybody would be rich. Every so often stocks need to “shake the tree” and get rid of “weak hands” before resuming higher. NVDA plunged nearly 10% in mid-May before ripping back above the 10-week moving average (a level that has contained most of the stock’s multiyear move). Our extensive, in-house back test shows that stocks that sport a Zacks Rank #3 or better and have a positive Earnings Surprise Prediction (ESP) score tend to beat earnings and outperform. Furthermore, while Wall Street is bullish on the stock, NVDA has beaten consensus estimates in 18 of the past 20 quarters."
UK watchdog decides not to investigate Microsoft's AI partnership with France's Mistral,"LONDON (AP) — British regulators said Friday they don't need to open a competition investigation into Microsoft's partnership with French artificial intelligence company Mistral, a month after asking for industry feedback on the deal. Microsoft announced earlier this year that it was partnering with the buzzy French startup in a move that that could lessen the software giant’s reliance on ChatGPT-maker OpenAI for supplying the next wave of chatbots and other generative AI products. The Competion and Markets Authority said in a brief update that the tie-up “does not qualify for investigation"" under U.K. merger rules. The watchdog had said in April that it was seeking comments from “interested third parties,” before deciding whether to carry out an in-depth antitrust investigation. By deciding not to probe the deal, ""the CMA confirmed that the structure of the partnership between Mistral and Microsoft does not grant sufficient rights/influence to Microsoft,"" Alex Haffner, competition partner at U.K. law firm Fladgate, said by email. The watchdog is still looking into Microsoft's hiring of key staff from another startup, Inflection AI, as well as Amazon’s $4 billion investment in San Francisco-based Anthropic. It didn't provide updates on those reviews, which were announced at the same time last month. Nor has it issued an update on its review of Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI since it asked for comments on that deal in December. The mystery is over: Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a major stake in the insurance company Chubb, finally revealing the investment he has kept under wraps since last year. In recent developments, the Singapore market has shown a keen interest in innovative sectors, highlighted by Mastercard's inclusion of Singapore-based peaq in its Start Path program focusing on blockchain and cryptocurrency. This move underscores a broader acceptance and integration of emerging technologies within the local economic landscape.

11 Hot Growth Stocks To Buy Right Now,"In this article, we discuss the 11 hot growth stocks to buy now. If you want to read about some more growth stocks that are active in the market, go directly to the 5 Hot Growth Stocks To Buy Right Now. As 2024 moves forward, the outlook for both the stock and bond markets undergoes regular fluctuations, influenced by various factors such as economic data releases, Federal Reserve communications, and changes in interest rate forecasts. As an example, the Federal Reserve hiked its benchmark interest rate 11 times from March 2022 to July 2023 amid resurgent inflation, reaching its highest level in more than two decades. This uptick in borrowing costs has contributed to alleviating inflationary pressures, with recent data showing consumer prices increasing by only 3.1% from January 2023, marking a decline from the peak of 9.1% in June 2022 and edging closer to the Fed's 2% target. Surprisingly, progress against inflation has been notable without inflicting significant economic hardship, with unemployment remaining below 4% for 24 consecutive months. Moreover, employers have consistently added an average of 244,000 jobs per month over the past year, with December and January seeing over 300,000 new jobs each. This combination of subdued inflation and GDP growth has fostered optimism that perhaps the Fed can achieve a rare ""soft landing."" On the other hand, the current year has an array of growth opportunities spanning different sectors within the capital markets. Leading the forefront is the technology sector, with artificial intelligence (AI) spearheading innovation. Its swift advancements and widespread integration across various industries render it an appealing option for investors pursuing growth and transformative prospects. As an illustration to this point, venture capital investments in generative AI and AI-related startups surged to nearly $50 billion the past year alone, with notable startups such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Inflection commanding substantial portions of these investments. Following suit is the healthcare sector, securing the second spot, as it progresses alongside developments in medical technologies and a growing emphasis on personalized medicine. The increasing demand for GLP-1, a medication class utilized in managing type 2 diabetes (T2D), is a key factor driving this trend. According to research by J.P. Morgan, the GLP-1 category is projected to surpass $100 billion by 2030, with growth attributed equally to its use in treating both diabetes and obesity. When it comes to stock selection for substantial returns in such times, focusing on growth stocks is a popular strategy. Growth stocks are characterized by higher share prices relative to their earnings per share, reflecting expectations of significant future growth. One metric commonly used to identify growth stocks is the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio). This ratio compares the current share price to the earnings per share, indicating the premium that the market is willing to pay for a stock's earnings potential. Some of the notable companies included in our list of hot growth stocks to buy are Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), as well as industry giants like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), among others listed below.

Tesla and Microsoft presented 2 distinct versions of AI. Investors liked both.,"This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings Investors were treated to two different versions of artificial intelligence this week. And both sound pretty good. Microsoft (MSFT) announced a partnership with Coca-Cola (KO) in which the soft drink king would pay $1.1 billion to “jointly experiment” with Microsoft’s new Azure AI-based version of its cloud-based suite of productivity software. And when Microsoft’s quarterly results showed AI driving more and more of its cloud business growth and bullish guidance from an enthusiastic leadership team, the stock rose 2% Friday. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) had a similar story, but with a stronger investor reaction — up 10% Friday — as investors reconsidered the company’s second-place position to Microsoft. Now, it seems YouTube, search, and cloud businesses are strapped in and ready for their AI-ification. On the other side of the table was Tesla’s (TSLA) earnings presentation. The company doubled down on its endgame of fully autonomous vehicles, a robotaxi fleet, licensing self-driving tech to other automakers — they’re in conversations, Elon Musk said — and the potential of harnessing the AI computing power of parked Teslas to create something akin to Amazon’s AWS, a bold but old idea that has been floating around since the 1980s."
Melinda French Gates is resigning from the $63 billion Gates Foundation to focus on ‘the next chapter’ of her philanthropy,"Melinda French Gates is stepping down as co-chair of the $63 billion foundation she set up two decades ago with her ex-husband, Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates, according to a statement she posted on social media on Monday. “This is not a decision I came to lightly,” French Gates wrote in her statement, noting that her last day of work at the foundation would be on June 7 and that she was “immensely proud” of the foundation she had built with her ex-husband. Melinda and Bill Gates divorced in May 2021, following nearly 30 years of marriage. But French Gates had continued to support the foundation and its work, even after the divorce. French Gates did not provide any reason for her resignation on Monday, saying only that ""the time is right for me to move forward into the next chapter of my philanthropy."" But the possibility of a split had been hinted three years ago. After the Gates’ divorce in 2021, the Foundation had publicly said that French Gates would resign as co-chair and trustee if, after two years, either of them decided “that they cannot continue to work together.” The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation did not respond to an immediate request for comment. Following French Gates’ resignation, the Foundation will change its name to the “Gates Foundation,” according to a statement from Foundation CEO Mark Suzman he posted on X. “Bill will become the sole Chair of the foundation,” Suzman wrote. The Gates Foundation reported having $63.6 billion in assets on its most recent filing with the IRS, according to records. As part of an agreement she made with Bill Gates, Melinda Gates said that she now has “an additional $12.5 billion to commit to my work on behalf of women and families.” It was not immediately clear if French Gates planned to set up a new non-profit organization to pursue her philanthropic work, or to combine the efforts with some of her existing organizations. In 2019, French Gates had separately committed $1 billion of her own money to Pivotal Ventures, a company focused on improving women’s lives in the U.S. via venture capital, philanthropic giving, and advocacy. ""The investments Pivotal makes in these funds aren’t philanthropic,"" French Gates wrote in a commentary piece for Fortune last year. ""These are return-seeking investments, and we expect them to be profitable. I want to signal to other investors that by overlooking these opportunities, they’re leaving money on the table."" French Gates and MacKenzie Scott, who divorced from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos in 2019, have become two of the most renowned philanthropists in the United States. Scott pledged to give away more than half of her wealth after her divorce from Bezos, and has given away more than $16.5 billion to more than 1,900 non-profits in the last few years."
13 Best Growth Stocks To Invest In For the Next 5 Years,"In this article, we discuss 13 best growth stocks to invest in for the next 5 years. If you want to skip our discussion on the stock market landscape, head over to 5 Best Growth Stocks To Invest In For the Next 5 Years. Despite facing fluctuations and pressures, the U.S. stock market has shown remarkable resilience in 2024. Following a robust performance in 2023, the broad-based S&P 500 index has delivered a 6.91% return thus far in 2024. Although concerns about a potential pullback due to high-interest rates and geopolitical risks have emerged among investors, there are still opportunities for profit in the market. Toward the end of 2023, the Federal Reserve expressed optimism about the US economy, with chairman Jerome Powell highlighting progress toward the Fed's 2% inflation target. A report by Confluence Technologies in January of this year indicated that this rally favored growth and volatility in the equity markets. As reported by CBS News, economists anticipate 2024 to be a year of accelerated growth, reduced inflation, and robust job creation in stark contrast to the recession concerns prevalent in 2023. The National Association for Business Economics (NABE) predicts a 2.2% increase in gross domestic product (GDP) for 2024, a notably more optimistic outlook than their projections from just two months ago. Inflation, which impacts expenses like groceries, rent, and insurance, is also anticipated to further decelerate this year, with NABE forecasting a decline in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to an annual rate of 2.4%, down from 4.1% in 2023 and 8% in 2022. As Q2 commences, investor sentiment towards the stock market has shifted, with expectations leaning towards a resilient economic backdrop. This adjustment comes as recent economic indicators reveal that while inflation has moderated from its 2022 peaks, it remains above the Federal Reserve's desired levels. The market's attention turned to Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) following the company's first-quarter earnings, marking the beginning of the earnings season among the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks that drove much of last year's S&P 500 gains. surged by as much as 8% in after-hours trading following its announcement regarding plans to introduce more affordable models in its future vehicle lineup. Despite falling short of earnings expectations on both revenue and profit, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) exceeded estimates for gross margins, achieving 17.4% compared to the anticipated 16.5%. Given the automaker's significant weighting in the S&P 500 index, its earnings performance is expected to serve as a significant catalyst for the broader market. While hopes for lower interest rates emerged after last year's inflationary pressures eased, recent data indicating persistent inflation concerns has tempered such expectations. Therefore, the welcomed news of a slowdown in overall business activity across the nation on April 23 could provide room for the Federal Reserve to implement the one or two interest rate cuts that many traders are currently anticipating. See Also: 11 Hot Growth Stocks To Buy Right Now. In times ripe for substantial returns, many investors turn to growth stocks as a favored approach. These stocks typically boast higher share prices relative to their earnings per share, reflecting expectations of robust future growth. A key metric often utilized to identify such stocks is the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio), comparing the current share price to earnings per share and indicating the premium investors are willing to pay for a stock's future earnings potential. In the previous year, growth stocks notably outpaced the S&P 500. Bloomberg in January highlighted that the S&P 500 Growth Index surged by 30% in 2023, surpassing the broader benchmark index's gain of 22% for the same period. This performance surprised many investors, especially given the Federal Reserve's consistent rate-hiking stance throughout the year. Over the past few years, certain growth stocks have not only reshaped industries but also left a significant mark on history. A prime illustration of this phenomenon is Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), a semiconductor designer, whose shares have surged by an impressive 443.84% over the last five years on the back of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) and semiconductor chip craze. Furthermore, Brandywine Global highlighted in its Quantitative Review of US Equities for the fourth quarter of 2023 that growth stocks within the Russell 1000 Growth Index substantially outpaced their value counterparts in the Russell 1000 Value Index. By the close of 2023, the growth index boasted returns of 42.7%, whereas the value index significantly trailed with a gain of only 11.5%. In addition, Matt Orton, the chief market strategist at Raymond James Investment Management, advises investors to look beyond concerns about high valuations of U.S. stocks and instead focus on growth opportunities. Here is what he said: “I fully think that the market could push 20, 21 times, and that’s a perfectly fair multiple for us to pay. It’s all about earnings growth and it’s all about leaning into where those fundamentals are, and trying to avoid the parts of the market where you don’t have a positive inflection in earnings. And if you do that, no matter what the valuation is, you can grow into it, and I think that’s the main message for investors, is ‘find growth.’” Among the standout companies on our roster of promising growth stocks to consider are Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), and Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), among others detailed below."

"Microsoft Leads Magnificent 7 In Reddit Discussion: AI, Market Positioning, Cloud Computing A Hit With Traders","In the midst of the fervor surrounding U.S. tech stocks, one question lingers: which among the Magnificent Seven stocks stands as the healthiest, most resilient player when the hype fades? Redditor Physioweng’s query sparked a thoughtful discussion, with Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) emerging as a popular choice for its robust fundamentals and strategic positioning.  Which Magnificent 7 is the healthiest? byu/Physioweng instocks Commentators highlighted Microsoft’s exceptional leadership and its dominance in AI talent as key indicators of strength. Despite criticisms about its AI capabilities, particularly compared to Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), known as Google, Microsoft’s strategic application of AI has been a standout feature. Its multifaceted approach, spanning cloud computing, software development, gaming, hardware design, search, advertising, and acquisitions like GitHub and LinkedIn, underscores its status as a diversified powerhouse. “It’s more like a mini etf itself,” commented Redditor St3w1e0.  Comment byu/Physioweng from discussion instocks The debate over AI leadership between Microsoft and Google sparked further analysis. While Google is recognized for its innovative prowess, commentators noted Microsoft’s practical application and superior execution in AI. Microsoft’s ability to find real-world applications for AI technologies has given it an edge, contrasting with Google’s struggles to maintain product continuity.

"Tech earnings season is coming, and AI is top of mind","Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and the rest of their Big Tech cohorts are gearing up for what is expected to be one of the more eventful earnings seasons in some time. Generative AI will no doubt be top of mind as the push to monetize the technology continues and investors look for any indication that those billions of dollars in investments are starting to pay off. “We're forecasting it to be about an 8% growth as a kind of collective growth number for the large-cap technology companies,” said Alex Smith, head of Canalys' channels research department. “In terms of overall growth, Nvidia is going to far outstrip the rest of the market.” But generative AI isn’t the only thing on investors’ minds. Apple’s earnings should prove eventful after the company’s rough start to the year, with the iPhone maker facing everything from antitrust lawsuits to slowing sales in China, one of its most important markets. Meta (META) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), meanwhile, will give Wall Street a sense of how the digital advertising market is performing. Both companies saw sales increase in the prior quarter, but Alphabet fell shy of analysts’ expectations. The search giant will need to flip the script this quarter. Strap in because it’s going to be a wild few weeks. The generative AI explosion is still reverberating across Wall Street as shares of heavy hitters like Nvidia and Microsoft continue to soar. But after a year of hype, companies will need to start showing that the excitement is paying off. “We can be absolutely sure that the first and most important thing that investors are going to be eyeballing is companies kind of taking their AI washing [saying something uses AI even if it doesn’t] and turning it into meaningful contributions to the top and bottom line,” Daniel Newman, CEO of the technology advisory and research firm The Futurum Group, told Yahoo Finance. Shares of Nvidia are up roughly 75% year to date and 225% over the past 12 months, as hyperscalers like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta grab as many of the company’s AI chips as possible. That has sent Nvidia’s revenue through the roof. In Q4, Nvidia reported revenue of $22.1 billion, up from $6.1 billion in the prior year. But the company is going to begin lapping its explosive growth numbers this year, which could put a damper on investor enthusiasm even if it continues to outperform. “You've had these massive blowouts but as soon as you start to lap that first year of massive blowouts, then it's going to be more average growth numbers,” said TECHnalysis Research president Bob O’Donnell."
Google remains focused on its long quest for your eyeballs,"Google announced this week that it would begin the international rollout of its new artificial intelligence-powered search feature, called AI Overviews. When billions of people search a range of topics from news to recipes to general knowledge questions, what they see first will now be an AI-generated summary. Google touted AI Overviews at its annual I/O developer conference as a way of delivering customers quick answers and simplifying the online search experience, but it also has another effect on the way that people engage with the internet: keeping users, and advertisers, on Google.com. It’s a new era in Google’s years-long quest for your attention. “Google will do the googling for you,” said Liz Reid, head of Google Search. While Google was once mostly a portal to reach other parts of the internet, it has spent years consolidating content and services to make itself into the web’s primary destination. Weather, flights, sports scores, stock prices, language translation, showtimes and a host of other information have gradually been incorporated into Google’s search page over the past 15 or so years. Finding that information no longer requires clicking through to another website. With AI Overviews, the rest of the internet may meet the same fate. Related: Google rolls out AI-generated, summarized search results in US Website owners are understandably concerned. Although Google’s demonstration gave the appearance that its AI could whisk its answers out of thin air, these overviews are built off content from news outlets, cooking blogs, product reviews and other articles that require human workers to write them. All of these sites rely on advertising revenue from people visiting their web pages, something that may no longer happen if users can get a summarized version of a site within seconds of searching. Google has tried to assuage publishers’ fears that users will no longer see their links or click through to their sites, with Reid stating during I/O that individual articles featured in AI Overviews get more traffic than if they were traditional web listings. The company has not mentioned whether it predicts overall search traffic will decline, however, and research firm Gartner predicts a 25% drop in traffic to websites from search engines by 2026 – a decrease that would be disastrous for most outlets and creators. AI Overviews are the culmination of a long line of products, going back almost two decades to the launch of its customized homepage, that have turned Google.com into its own self-contained online ecosystem. One of its first major advances in the amount of information Google would display on its search page came in 2012, with the debut of Knowledge Panels – boxes of information, usually taken from Wikipedia, that display basic information, photos and biographical details about a person or subject. Knowledge Panels expanded to the point that Google chief executive Sundar Pichai boasted in 2016 that they contained 70bn facts. Next came other services like stock prices and weather reports that would have previously required users to direct their attention to websites, causing alarm among outlets built around providing such information. When Google began featuring sports schedules on its page in 2013, TechCrunch ran an article titled “Google Embeds March Madness Bracket In Search, Because Screw Sports Sites”. As Google began to aggregate an increasing amount of information, concerns also grew around misinformation. Knowledge panels sometimes listed living persons as dead or automatically generated people’s job titles, regardless of why they might be public figures – leading to Google calling one of America’s worst mass murderers a “real estate investor”. AI Overviews have already started returning wrong answers. Related: AI may cause job losses and rise in carbon emissions, report finds "
"Reddit is maturing as a company, CEO says","Reddit (RDDT) is entering its adult years, and that may turn out well for investors. ""A lot of things are really starting to click,"" Reddit co-founder and CEO Steve Huffman told Yahoo Finance on Thursday (video above). The company this week reported its first results since going public in late March — and there was much to prove the bears wrong. Daily active users increased 37% year over year to 82.7 million. Weekly active unique users rose 40% from the prior year. Total revenue improved 48% to $243 million, nearly doubling the growth rate from the prior quarter, due to strength in advertising. The company delivered adjusted operating profits of $10 million, versus a $50.2 million loss a year ago. Huffman declined to say when the company would be profitable on a net income basis, noting it's a focus for the management team. Other areas of focus include rolling out a new user interface this year, introducing shopping capabilities, and searching for another artificial intelligence content licensing deal like the one with Google (GOOG, GOOGL). ""Results this quarter show that Reddit is on the early end of a number of positive inflections: Top-of-funnel growth is accelerating, the ad platform is in the early stages of being built to address lower funnel objectives, the data licensing business is in the very early stages of growth, and the company is entering a harvest period in costs after aggressively adding to headcount over the last couple years,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Benjamin Black said in a client note. For Reddit, the quarter was another win for 2024. Initially expected to price its IPO in the $31 to $34 per share range, Reddit ended up pricing its IPO at $34 in late March, giving it a $6.4 billion valuation. The targeted valuation on a fully diluted basis was less than the $10 billion it fetched in a 2021 funding round. The stock began trading at $47 per share and quickly shot past $53."
"UPDATE 2-OpenAI plans to announce Google search competitor on Monday, sources say","(Updates May 9 story with company and CEO posts on X about upcoming event) By Anna Tong May 9 (Reuters) - OpenAI plans to announce its artificial intelligence-powered search product on Monday, according to two sources familiar with the matter, raising the stakes in its competition with search king Google. The announcement date, though subject to change, has not been previously reported. Bloomberg and the Information have reported that Microsoft-backed OpenAI is working on a search product to potentially compete with Alphabet's Google and with Perplexity, a well-funded AI search startup. OpenAI declined to comment before Reuters published its report on Thursday. After publication, OpenAI on Friday posted on X that the company would stream a live event on Monday, to ""demo some ChatGPT and GPT-4 updates."" CEO Sam Altman later posted on X, ""not gpt-5, not a search engine, but we’ve been hard at work on some new stuff we think people will love! feels like magic to me."" Alphabet's stock partly recovered from an over 2% loss following Altman's post, and was last down 0.9%. OpenAI's announcements could be timed a day before the Tuesday start of Google's annual I/O conference, where the tech giant is expected to unveil a slew of AI-related products. OpenAI's search product is an extension of its flagship ChatGPT product, and enables ChatGPT to pull in direct information from the Web and include citations, according to Bloomberg. ChatGPT is OpenAI's chatbot product that uses the company's cutting-edge AI models to generate human-like responses to text prompts."
UPDATE 1-Malaysia to ask Meta to explain removal of Facebook posts on PM's Hamas meeting,"(Recasts, adds details and background) KUALA LUMPUR, May 15 (Reuters) - Malaysia will ask Meta Platforms to explain the removal of posts from Facebook related to media reports of Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim's publicised meeting this week with a Hamas leader, its government said on Wednesday. Anwar met Ismail Haniyeh of Hamas in Qatar and on Tuesday and said he had good relations with the political leaders of Hamas, but no involvement in its military apparatus. Muslim-majority Malaysia has long been a vocal supporter of the Palestinian cause and has advocated for a two-state solution to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. Malaysia's communications regulator had received complaints regarding the removal of the Facebook posts, government spokesperson and Communications Minister Fahmi Fadzil told a regular media briefing. Meta did not immediately response to a request for comment on Malaysia's concerns. Last October, Fahmi warned that firm action could be taken against Meta and TikTok if they were blocking pro-Palestinian content on their platforms. (Reporting by Danial Azhar; Editing by John Mair, Martin Petty) Yulia Morozova/ReutersLess than 24 hours after Vladimir Putin sent his defense minister packing after reportedly privately blaming him for failures in the war against Ukraine, another top Defense Ministry official was yanked out of bed by masked security forces.Counterintelligence agents reportedly arrived armed to the teeth to detain Lieutenant-General Yury Kuznetsov, the head of the Defense Ministry’s personnel department, on bribery charges Monday.

The Philippine coast guard and navy deployed one patrol ship each to keep watch from a distance on the activists and fishermen, who set off on wooden boats with bamboo outriggers to assert Manila’s sovereignty over the Scarborough Shoal.  Activists and volunteers, including a Roman Catholic priest, belonging to a nongovernment coalition called Atin Ito — Tagalog for This is Ours — planned to float small territorial buoys and distribute food packs and fuel to Filipino fishermen near the shoal, organizers said, adding they were prepared for contingencies."
‘News on Facebook is dead’: memes replace Australian media posts as Meta turns off the tap,"Meta has refused to enter into new deals with Australian media publishers for the use of their content on Facebook, leading to fears it may again implement a ban on news content appearing on the platform. But an analysis of Facebook data suggests engagement with posts from news organisations is already at an all-time low, as memes fill the space. Meta has argued that news makes up just 3% of what people engage with on its services. Related: ‘Anti-democratic’: Labor minister warns Facebook against removal of Australian news content An analysis by Guardian Australia has determined that this appears to be by design, with Meta turning off the tap for news in the past few years. A study originally carried out in 2021 by researchers from the University of Technology Sydney and RMIT looked at the amount of engagement with Facebook posts by Australian news organisations over time. It showed a decline in engagement between 2015 and November 2020, as well as a decline in traffic from Facebook to news websites. Guardian Australia has updated this analysis, which shows that engagement with posts from Australian media is now at an all-time low, with the exception of the brief period in February 2021 when Facebook blocked news posts in Australia. This drop in engagement and traffic was due at least in part to changes Meta made to its algorithms, which resulted in less news being shown in the home feed of Facebook users. But the UTS and RMIT analysis also shows some publishers changed their approaches to social media in response, focusing on different sources of traffic, such as Google search. James Meese, one of the RMIT researchers in the 2021 study, says the updated research shows that news on Facebook has continued to underperform on the platform since 2017. “Another way to say underperformance is just to say that news on Facebook is dead,” he says."
Biden touts new $3.3 billion Microsoft data center at failed Foxconn site Trump backed,"By Andrea Shalal RACINE, Wisconsin (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden on Wednesday unveiled plans by Microsoft Corp to build a $3.3 billion data center in southeastern Wisconsin, drawing a sharp contrast to his Republican predecessor who had backed a previous $10 billion project at the same site that was significantly scaled back. Biden, on his fourth visit to Wisconsin this year, said Microsoft's investment would create thousands of jobs in the presidential election battleground state that his campaign sees as critical to his bid for a second term. The facility will be built where Biden's rival for the presidency, Donald Trump, announced a $10 billion investment by Taiwan electronics manufacturer Foxconn in 2017 that the company later drastically scaled back. Trump had called it ""the eighth wonder of the world."" ""I'm here to talk about a great comeback story in America,"" Biden told about 200 people at Gateway Technical College's Sturtevant campus in a Midwestern state hit by manufacturing declines. The president said Microsoft's investment would ""be transformative, not only here, but worldwide."" ""My predecessor made promises, which he broke,"" Biden said. ""On my watch, we make promises and we keep promises."" Foxconn in 2021 said it would invest $672 million at the site instead of the $10 billion initially planned and forecast 1,454 new jobs, down from 13,000 as its plans shifted and tax breaks were reduced amid local skepticism. Microsoft President Brad Smith said the U.S. company planned to invest $3.3 billion by the end of 2026 and use artificial intelligence to boost manufacturing and help workers. The White House said that investment would result in 2,300 union construction jobs and around 2,000 permanent jobs over time. It said nearly 4,000 jobs had been added in the nearby city of Racine since Biden took office, while about 1,000 manufacturing jobs were lost during the Trump administration."
13 Best Ethical Companies to Invest in 2024,"In this piece, we will take a look at the 13 best ethical companies to invest in 2024. If you want to skip our overview of ESG stocks, then you can take a look at 5 Best Ethical Companies to Invest in 2024.  The relationship of the corporate sector with the well-being of the general population is always controversial. On one end, firms like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) have transformed people's lives and allowed them to improve their health, stay connected, and shop for countless products affordably. On the other end, some of the most controversial companies in the world are among the most valuable as well. The best examples of these are the oil mega giants such as Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) who are often targeted by environmental activists due to the polluting effects of their products. Balancing both these factors, i.e. the negative externalities that result from the costs of doing business and the benefits to society of private enterprise, is a field called Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG). ESG seeks to invest only in those companies that are aware of the impact that their operations make on the environment and are actively working to mitigate this impact. It is a relatively newer phenomenon, and despite its noble objectives, the trend seems to have run into roadblocks as of late. This is because the stock market of 2024 is quite different from the 'environment' that was in play in 2018, when ESG investing was gaining traction. In 2018, sustainable investing surged to $30 trillion, as investors forced companies to become more climate conscious and favored those that took the initiative. However, in 2018, interest rates weren't as high as they are right now, and inflation had not yet tasted the impacts of loose monetary policies and global supply chain disruptions. In 2024, the stock market and the broader finance industry are still recovering from both of these. While rates are still high and creating constraints for investors to raise capital, inflation is on a downward trend. At the same time, the fallout from the Russian invasion of Ukraine has shown that the global oil industry is still quite crucial to economic well being despite the fact that fossil fuels are also some of the biggest polluters on the planet. Taking a look at recent stats, data from Bloomberg shows that 2023 wasn't a particularly great year for ESG. The ESG market fell to $30.3 trillion in 2023 from $35 trillion at the start of the year, and subsequent data showed that 2023 was the worst year on record for the sector. This data comes from Morningstar Financial and it reveals that during the fourth quarter of 2023, sustainable funds marked their first full year of outflows in a decade. In Q4 alone, a whopping $5 billion went out of these funds, a figure that jumps to $13 billion for the full year. These outflows came on the back of disappointing performance of sustainable equity funds in particular, as Morningstar's data shows that ""32% of sustainable equity funds dropped to the bottom quartile relative to peers."" This also ensured that the fourth quarter marked the fifth consecutive quarter where investors preferred sustainable funds when compared to their traditional counterparts. Before we head to the best ethical companies, it's also important to know why ESG and stocks with a focus on the environment and broader business sustainability tend to have shied away from gains as of late. One of the biggest reasons behind this is high interest rates, which means that earning a profit becomes difficult. Therefore, companies that focus on sustainability have to deal with high business costs and have to fund costly projects, which means that investors find a better bang for their buck elsewhere. On a final note, here's what Madison Investments had to say about its Madison Sustainable Equity Fund's performance during the fourth quarter of 2023: Equity markets finished the year on a strong note with the S&P 500 up 11.7% during the fourth quarter, bringing the full year return to 26.3%. The Madison Sustainable Equity Fund (Class Y) returned 11.9% in the fourth quarter but lagged the S&P 500 for the full year, returning 18.0%. The strength during the fourth quarter can be attributed to the downward shift of the yield curve. Interest rates dropped during the fourth quarter as inflation moderated and the market began to discount an end to Fed rate hikes and even began discounting interest rate cuts in 2024. Rates rose during the third quarter, with the 2-year Treasury rising to 5.05% and the 10-year moving to 4.58%, its highest level since September 2007. Then in the fourth quarter, the 2-year rate fell to 4.35% and the 10-year fell to 3.94%. Both fixed income and equities rallied in the fourth quarter. The economy is still growing, real GDP grew 4.9% in Q3 and is expected to grow 1.2% in Q4, and 1.3% in 2024. Headline inflation is moderating but remains above the desired 2%. Inflation fell to 3.5% in Q3 and is expected to drop to 3.2% in Q4 with expectations for inflation to fall to 2.6% in 2024. Unemployment remains low at 3.7%, and the consumer continues to spend. However, with Covid savings dwindling and credit card balances rising, we anticipate consumer spending will slow in 2024. The market now expects that the Federal Reserve will cut the Fed Funds rate in 2024. Expectations are for the Fed to begin cutting rates in the second quarter. We continue to expect the Fed to keep rates high until inflation moves closer to 2%, which may not happen until 2025."
US STOCKS-Futures edge higher at start of data-heavy week,"(For a Reuters live blog on U.S., UK and European stock markets, click or type LIVE/ in a news window.) * Futures up: S&P 500 0.12%, Nasdaq 100 0.22%, Dow 0.06% May 13 (Reuters) - Futures for the main U.S. indexes were slightly higher on Monday, after several weeks of gains, as investors awaited key inflation figures this week to gauge the likelihood of interest rate cuts this year. On Friday, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite registered their third week of gains in a row for the first time since January, while the Dow posted its biggest weekly gain since mid-December. The indexes were also trading near their peaks, boosted by stronger-than-expected earnings reports and signs of a cooling U.S. labor market that fueled bets of one or two rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve this year. Investors will focus on a spate of economic readings this week, including monthly producer and consumer prices, retail sales and weekly jobless claims. The keenly awaited inflation data on Wednesday is expected to show that core consumer prices rose 0.3% on a month-over-month basis in April, for an annual rise of 3.6%, according to economists forecasts in a Reuters poll. ""After upside surprises in the first quarter, markets will focus on service inflation excluding shelter and energy services,"" said Ronald Temple, chief market strategist at Lazard."
Qualcomm is coming for Intel’s biggest market: PCs,"Qualcomm (QCOM) is ramping up its efforts to win the AI PC race and heading for a collision course with Intel (INTC) and AMD (AMD), with the debut of its new Arm-based (ARM) Snapdragon X Plus chip for Windows-based laptops. The company previously announced its more powerful Snapdragon X Elite for Windows laptops in October. The chips, which Qualcomm says will be available sometime in mid-2024, are designed to take on Intel’s latest Core Ultra line of chips as well as Apple’s M3 chip lineup. The X Elite features a 12-core Oryon central processing unit (CPU), onboard Adreno graphics processing unit (GPU), and Qualcomm’s Hexagon neural processing unit (NPU). The X Plus packs a 10-core CPU, a built-in GPU, and a similar Hexagon NPU as the X Elite. The chips can also be outfitted with up to 64GB of memory. Qualcomm is marketing both sets of chips as AI powerhouses, saying that they offer the world’s fastest NPUs for laptops, which allows for better overall performance while running local generative AI applications. In most cases, generative AI apps run on large data center servers that you access via the web. That’s great up until you don’t have an internet connection. The idea behind local AI apps is that you’re able to use them without needing to be online and your data stays on your device rather than on the internet. But so far, there haven’t been too many compelling onboard AI apps to get consumers running out the door to buy AI PCs. Despite that, the industry is banking heavily on the concept to help push sales throughout 2024. Intel, AMD, and Nvidia (NVDA) are marketing some of their high-end laptops as AI PCs. Outside of their AI capabilities, Qualcomm claims the Arm-based X Elite and X Plus lines offer better performance per watt than the Intel Core Ultra 7 155H and AMD Ryzen 9 7940HS chips. The X Elite and X Plus also consume less power than competing Intel and AMD chips, Qualcomm says. Qualcomm is even lining up the X Elite and X Plus against Apple’s Arm-based M3 chips, claiming that the processors are 28% and 10% faster than the iPhone maker’s offerings, respectively. It’s important to note that these kinds of numbers are based on benchmarks, and real-world performance could differ. This is just Qualcomm’s latest dive into the Windows PC market. The company already offers Arm-based chips for Windows systems but hasn't gained much traction in the market. Part of the reason for that had to do with translating apps built for x86 systems that run on Intel and AMD chips to work on Arm-based platforms."
Google I/O shows why the search giant is sitting pretty against OpenAI,"Google’s annual I/O developer conference kicked off yesterday, under the circus-like big top of the Shoreline Amphitheater, with improvisational musician and YouTuber Marc Rebillet climbing out of a giant Google coffee cup in a rainbow-colored robe. He stepped up to a DJ booth to show off Google’s new generative AI music tool, called MusicFX, with a demo filled with thumping beats meant to wake up, he shouted, the “silly little nerds.” It was a surprisingly silly moment after several days of serious buildup to this week of AI announcements, which turned out to include a preemptive product launch from OpenAI. Social media amped up sky-high expectations about how OpenAI might steal Google’s thunder: An announcement of its own ChatGPT search? A surprise roll-out of GPT-5? For a moment, it was easy to imagine Google getting, well, screwed by OpenAI's advance move. Or screwed once again, more accurately. After all, a year ago there were plenty of headlines like 'AI First' To Last: How Google Fell Behind In The AI Boom. After ChatGPT launched in November 2022, there were reports that Pichai had declared a ‘code red’ inside the company in response, so panicked was he about the threat OpenAI and its alliance with Microsoft posed to Google's business. From the outside, at least, it seemed like a humiliating takedown, considering that Google had been so far ahead in AI in 2019 that Microsoft decided to invest in OpenAI because it was “very worried” that Google was so far ahead in AI. And at 2023's Google I/O conference in 2023, the company seemed decidedly defensive, reminding the audience multiple times of how Google had been the first ""AI first"" company, and rolling out a slew of disjointed and not fully-thought-out product offerings and demos. The whole thing seemed rushed and designed to simply match Microsoft and OpenAI. This year was a whole different vibe. By yesterday afternoon, when both OpenAI's and Google's live-streamed announcements were finished—with nothing but memories left of OpenAI’s emotive-on-steroids voice assistant; Google’s rollout of AI Overviews in search; and several demos featuring dogs—it was clear why Pichai seemed so much more relaxed this year. It’s because far from screwing up on AI, Google actually is sitting pretty. Not only has it caught up to the point that its Gemini models are considered in the top-tier, but it has renewed confidence in the strength of a moat that OpenAI cannot easily cross: Google's vast consumer distribution across a deep and broad mix of products with billions of users. Many have accused Google of being bloated, bureaucratic and slow. But it has unparalleled scale. Jim Fan, a Nvidia senior research manager and lead of embodied AI, said it succinctly in an X post yesterday. “Google's strongest moat is distribution,” he wrote. “Gemini doesn't have to be the best model to be the most used one in the world.” OpenAI may have a technical lead—GPT-4 remains the state-of-the-art AI model to beat for certain reasoning tasks, for one thing—and as a startup with an $80 billion private market valuation, it may also be able to move faster than Google. But Google has Search, Gmail, Maps, Photos, Calendar, Drive, Docs, Sheets and Android. By integrating generative AI into all of those products and using AI to tie them all together (for example, an AI-powered workflow that scours your Google applications for data to bring into Sheets and also your Calendar) it can keep users coming back for more. Even the Google search box already ties in AI across products, offering options to search photos, translate text, solve homework with Google Lens, identify songs and shop for products in screenshots. Furthermore, if Google’s distribution is its strongest moat, its secret sauce is arguably the massive amounts of data that flows through its products every day—petabytes from web searches, YouTube videos, Map requests, customer reviews, and much more. In addition to training its models, users can ask Google's AI features to dig through data stored in Google apps to help with an ever-increasing array of personalized tasks–basically using Google to Google your own Google. Of course, none of this means Google’s future AI success is assured. It may be able to rack up user numbers with its deep product bench and broad reach, but when it comes to revenue, the company’s business model is wrapped around Search. And it remains to be seen whether the rollout of AI Overviews in Search will cannibalize its referrals and ads business. It also remains uncertain how badly generative AI -created content will pollute the entire information ecosystem, resulting in worse search results—whether AI-generated or ranked links—and driving users away. In addition, while it can’t be as nimble and quick as OpenAI, Google needs to avoid tying itself in knots over being ""responsible,"" as it did during the “woke” image controversy around Gemini back in February. But, it increasingly looks as though OpenAI will have to wage an uphill battle. If it wants to beat Google on consumer-facing AI products, it will have to show that it roll-out AI models that are better than Google's by a wide margin, and it will have to keep rolling those out to stay ahead. A rumored partnership with Apple to add ChatGPT to iPhones could help—Apple has the distribution OpenAI lacks, even with its Microsoft partnership. But short of announcing that the company has somehow reached AGI (whatever it deems that to be), Google has shown it will be very difficult to dislodge it from being the AI most consumers are likely to use.

CORRECTED-EXPLAINER-What risks do advanced AI models pose in the wrong hands?,"(Corrects to show Susan Wild and not Max Wise cosponsored the AI legislation in third to last paragraph) By Alexandra Alper WASHINGTON, May 9 (Reuters) - The Biden administration is poised to open up a new front in its effort to safeguard U.S. AI from China and Russia with preliminary plans to place guardrails around the most advanced AI models, Reuters reported on Wednesday. Government and private sector researchers worry U.S. adversaries could use the models, which mine vast amounts of text and images to summarize information and generate content, to wage aggressive cyber attacks or even create potent biological weapons. Here are some threats posed by AI: DEEPFAKES AND MISINFORMATION Deepfakes - realistic yet fabricated videos created by AI algorithms trained on copious online footage - are surfacing on social media, blurring fact and fiction in the polarized world of U.S. politics. While such synthetic media has been around for several years, it's been turbocharged over the past year by a slew of new ""generative AI"" tools such as Midjourney that make it cheap and easy to create convincing deepfakes. Image creation tools powered by artificial intelligence from companies including OpenAI and Microsoft, can be used to produce photos that could promote election or voting-related disinformation, despite each having policies against creating misleading content, researchers said in a report in March. Some disinformation campaigns simply harness the ability of AI to mimic real news articles as a means of disseminating false information. While major social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube have made efforts to prohibit and remove deepfakes, their effectiveness at policing such content varies. For example, last year, a Chinese government-controlled news site using a generative AI platform pushed a previously circulated false claim that the United States was running a lab in Kazakhstan to create biological weapons for use against China, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said in its 2024 homeland threat assessment."
"Stocks to watch this week: Nvidia, Marks & Spencer, Ryanair, and UK inflation","Earnings season is coming to an end but some major names are yet to report. Investors have some high expectations for some of the key companies reporting this week such as Nvidia and Marks and Spencer. Here's what to look out for: The darling of AI and technology investors will report results from its first quarter of fiscal year 2025 on 22 May. The AI boom would not be possible without the chips from Nvidia, with the chipmaker seeing shares surge by 239% last year. With demand far outstripping supply for its graphics processing units, investors will want to know if Nvidia — the last of the Mag 7 to report — can keep driving the AI-related rally the market enjoyed over the past year. Nvidia is anticipated to report earnings of $5.49 per share for the current quarter, marking an increase of 403.7% from the same quarter last year. The earnings are projected to be $23.94 per share and a revenue of $106.05bn (£83.8bn) for the entire fiscal year, according to TradingView. Read more: Mag 7 stocks including Apple and Amazon still holding strong ""The AI hype-train is not only rolling but delivering, as far as Nvidia is concerned. Momentum investors seem happy to pile in, although value seekers are likely to be more reticent, given the lofty valuation which leaves little room for error. In the final quarter of fiscal 2023, Nvidia ran a $2.7bn share buyback,"" Russ Mould, investment director, Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis, and Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst, all of AJ Bell, wrote. However, investors that want to jump in on the AI race now, hoping that Nvidia will reach even higher highs, might be disappointed."
Microsoft asks some China staff to relocate amid Sino-US tensions,"(Reuters) -Microsoft is asking some of its China-based employees to consider transferring outside the country, the company said on Thursday, as relations between U.S. and China grow increasingly strained over technologies like artificial intelligence and semiconductors. The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the news, said Microsoft is asking about 700 to 800 people who are involved in machine learning and other work related to cloud computing to consider relocating. ""Providing internal opportunities is a regular part of managing our global business. As part of this process, we shared an optional internal transfer opportunity with a subset of employees,"" a Microsoft spokesperson told Reuters in an emailed statement, without specifying the number of employees it sent the request to. Microsoft remains committed to China and will continue to operate there and other markets, the spokesperson said. The employees, mostly engineers of Chinese nationality, were earlier in the week offered an option to transfer to the U.S., Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand, WSJ reported, citing people familiar with the matter. The move comes amid spiralling Sino-U.S. relations as President Joe Biden's administration hiked tariffs on various Chinese imports including electric vehicle (EV) batteries, computer chips, and medical products. Reuters reported earlier this month that the U.S. Commerce Department is considering a new regulatory push to restrict the export of proprietary or closed-source AI models, whose software and the data it is trained on are kept under wraps. (Reporting by Kanjyik Ghosh, Surbhi Misra and Fanny Potkin; Editing by Nivedita Bhattacharjee) Tycoon Elon Musk, the owner of SpaceX, is scheduled to visit Indonesia to launch its satellite unit Starlink this Sunday, according to two cabinet ministers.  Minister Luhut Pandjaitan, a close ally of President Joko Widodo, said Musk would launch the service on the holiday island of Bali alongside the Indonesian leader.  While Indonesian officials have several times previously announced Musk would visit the country to attend events or discuss possible investments by his auto firm Tesla, this would be his first in-person visit. Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC said on Thursday there was no damage to its facilities after an incident at its Arizona factory construction site where a waste disposal truck driver was transported to hospital.  Firefighters responded to a reported explosion on Wednesday afternoon at the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company plant in Phoenix, the Arizona Republic reported, citing the local fire department.  TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker whose clients include Apple and Nvidia, said in a statement none of its employees or onsite construction workers had reported any related injuries."
"AMD beats on Q1 revenue and EPS, stock edges lower on light guidance","Chip giant AMD (AMD) reported its first quarter earnings on Tuesday beating analysts' expectations on the top and bottom lines, but lighter-than-anticipated guidance for the current quarter sent the stock lower. Shares in the chipmaker were down more than 6% in early trading on Wednesday. AMD's announcement follows rival Intel’s disappointing report last week, in which it posted a lower-than-anticipated revenue outlook for the current quarter. AMD said it expects Q2 revenue of between $5.4 billion and $6 billion; estimates called for $5.72 billion. AMD reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.62 on revenue of $5.5 billion. Wall Street was looking for adjusted EPS of $0.61 on revenue of $5.45 billion. The company reported EPS of $0.60 on revenue of $5.35 billion in the same quarter last year. Importantly, AMD saw better-than-anticipated Data Center revenue in the quarter, with the company reporting sales of $2.34 billion. Wall Street was looking for $2.31 billion. AMD’s MI300 chips are meant to go head-to-head with Nvidia’s (NVDA) bestselling H100 line of accelerators. The company previously said that its MI300X beats out Nvidia’s chips, a claim Nvidia rejected. Intel is also chasing Nvidia’s H100 platform with its Gaudi 3 accelerators. Nvidia, however, announced its follow-up to the H100, the Blackwell platform, during its GTC conference in March. This platform should offer better performance than its predecessor. The AI arms race isn’t slowing anytime soon, either. Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta (META) each announced that they’re pouring money into AI data center capabilities to build out and support their various software offerings. But whether AMD can steal significant market share away from market leader Nvidia remains to be seen. According to UBS Global Research analyst Timothy Arcuri, MI300X sales should bring in billions this year."
Are You Looking for a Top Momentum Pick? Why Amazon (AMZN) is a Great Choice,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades. Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us. Below, we take a look at Amazon (AMZN), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score. It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Amazon currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period. You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>> Set to Beat the Market? Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for AMZN that show why this online retailer shows promise as a solid momentum pick. A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area. For AMZN, shares are up 3.67% over the past week while the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry is up 1.77% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 1.1% compares favorably with the industry's 0.55% performance as well. While any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Shares of Amazon have increased 9.95% over the past quarter, and have gained 70.61% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 4.14% and 27.07%, respectively."
Here's why investors seem to be hesitant to own AMD stock: Mizuho,"Investors are growing increasingly skeptical about owning AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) stock, a Mizuho desk analyst highlighted in a new note. “Why add AMD if I own NVDA and AVGO here that are cheaper and feel much lower risk?” appears to be the key pushback among market participants, the analyst said. The chipmaker’s shares rose to an intraday high of $168 on Thursday, amid a broader surge in the technology sector driven by the recently released softer-than-expected inflation data. It seemed like a short squeeze was affecting much of the tech market, the analyst noted. Notably, AMD’s chipmaking peer Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) Technology was up 6-7% at one point despite the lack of any specific news or events. Meanwhile, AMD remains a significant short position for many East Coast hedge funds, and numerous long-only (LO) investors are steering clear of it ahead of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s Blackwell launch later this year. “Stock feels like a plane crash survivor on a life raft in middle of a massive ocean just looking for land,” the analyst wrote. “I remain a bull and love the risk reward if you have patience and duration (think 6-9 months). But I get the worry, hesitancy and concerns amongst investors.” Mizuho’s expert also said that AMD “could be the next Dell (NYSE:DELL),” another major hedge fund short that surged on a bullish preview from Morgan Stanley ahead of their earnings at the end of May. Meanwhile, new reports suggest that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) plans to promote AMD's MI300X GPUs for generative AI at their upcoming Build conference. While it’s known that Microsoft uses AMD's MI300 GPUs to balance Nvidia, recent negative calls in March and April implied that Microsoft was cutting orders to shift funds to Nvidia’s Blackwell GPUs, set for release later this year. “I would watch AMD today, and while this MSFT news itself is unlikely some major catalyst, any focus by MSFT on AMD’s MI300 next week to me feels like a positive catalyst as the cons view is MSFT will cut MI300 orders this yr and AMD will miss MI300 rev bogeys of $9-10B next yr,” the analyst concluded."
"From Hype To Reality, AI Reshapes Pharmaceutical Industry Across Drug Discovery To Marketing - Stocks To Watch","Pharmaceutical companies have been at the forefront of artificial intelligence for quite some time. Researchers have been using advanced AI models to understand disease mechanisms even before the recent surge in interest. Wednesday, researchers at Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google DeepMind developed AlphaFold 3, a new artificial intelligence (AI) model. AlphaFold 3 can predict the structure and interactions of biological molecules. This includes proteins, DNA, RNA, and small molecules that could function as drugs. According to the latest McKinsey Global Institute report, AI technology could generate $60 billion—$110 billion annually in economic value for the pharmaceutical industry, as it can help speed up the process of identifying compounds, their development, and approval. The report adds that generative AI’s impact on pharmaceuticals is expected to be profound as the foundational models are built on languages, images, omics, patient information, and other types of data that come together to explain and solve the disease process and effective treatment ways. Increased drug discovery, approval, and marketing speed can help companies resolve the asset life cycle compression issue, which is the diminishing amount of time companies have to capture the value of the new drug. McKinsey’s research shows that the time has decreased to 9.8 years from 11.7 years over the past 20 years. Despite the speedy discovery, the average cost of discovering and developing new drugs has increased. Generative AI using augmented foundational models can help accelerate pharma research, with drug discovery timelines cut by almost half. AI tech can have a potential economic value of $15 billion-$28 billion on research and discovery. The report notes that, on average, ten years and around $1.4 billion are needed to bring one new drug to the market, of which 80% is associated with clinical development."
Google is reinventing itself for the AI age,"MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. — Google (GOOG, GOOGL) is in the midst of a full-blown AI evolution. On Tuesday, the company announced a flurry of AI products and services during its I/O developer conference with the aim of repositioning itself as the world’s AI software leader. “We are fully in our Gemini era,” CEO Sundar Pichai said during his keynote, referring to the company’s latest Gemini AI models, while noting that AI is still “in the very early days of the AI platform shift.” For years, Google was considered Silicon Valley’s AI powerhouse. But OpenAI and Microsoft (MSFT) threw the company off course, entering into a multibillion-dollar, multiyear partnership in 2023 that saw Microsoft integrate OpenAI’s most advanced models into its productivity, search, and cloud products. All this helped crown Microsoft as the world’s most valuable company earlier this year. Google’s climb back hasn’t been easy. It originally debuted a ChatGPT competitor called Bard that fell short of initial expectations. And more recently, it bungled the rollout of its generative AI-powered image generator, a tool that the company admitted was not “working the way we intended.” Stealing back the AI throne starts with Google reinventing its most important product: Search. Now — or soon, as it’s rolling out over time — at the top of the screen, you’ll find a generative AI-powered area called AI Overview that offers summarized responses to queries along with links to the sources. It’s a major departure for Google and could impact everything from the company’s advertisers, its main source of revenue, to websites that rely on the firm for search traffic, such as travel platforms and media organizations. While the Search changes are easily the biggest updates to Google’s public-facing products, they weren’t the only consequential announcements at the show. Google also showed off a new AI-powered prototype assistant called Project Astra. During a pre-recorded stage demo, the platform, which views content streamed through your smartphone camera, was able to identify objects, solve programming problems, and more. Unlike digital assistants Google Assistant and Apple’s (AAPL) Siri, Project Astra offers a more creative, conversational tone that sounds more human-like. It’s even able to understand when you interrupt it, stopping to listen without getting mad. Not human-like!"
"OpenAI plans to announce Google search competitor on Monday, sources say","By Anna Tong (Reuters) -OpenAI plans to announce its artificial intelligence-powered search product on Monday, according to two sources familiar with the matter, raising the stakes in its competition with search king Google. The announcement date, though subject to change, has not been previously reported. Bloomberg and the Information have reported that Microsoft-backed OpenAI is working on a search product to potentially compete with Alphabet's Google and with Perplexity, a well-funded AI search startup. OpenAI declined to comment before Reuters published its report on Thursday. After publication, OpenAI on Friday posted on X that the company would stream a live event on Monday, to ""demo some ChatGPT and GPT-4 updates."" CEO Sam Altman later posted on X, ""not gpt-5, not a search engine, but we’ve been hard at work on some new stuff we think people will love! feels like magic to me."" Alphabet's stock partly recovered from an over 2% loss following Altman's post, and was last down 0.9%. OpenAI's announcements could be timed a day before the Tuesday start of Google's annual I/O conference, where the tech giant is expected to unveil a slew of AI-related products. OpenAI's search product is an extension of its flagship ChatGPT product, and enables ChatGPT to pull in direct information from the Web and include citations, according to Bloomberg. ChatGPT is OpenAI's chatbot product that uses the company's cutting-edge AI models to generate human-like responses to text prompts. Industry observers have long called ChatGPT an alternative for gathering online information, though it has struggled with providing accurate and real-time information from the Web. OpenAI earlier gave it an integration with Microsoft's Bing for paid subscribers. Meanwhile, Google has announced generative AI features for its own namesake engine."
"Google debuts a slew of generative AI features as fight with rivals OpenAI, Microsoft, and Apple heats up","Google (GOOG, GOOGL) unveiled a slew of generative AI products at its Google I/O developer conference on Tuesday, including its Gemini Live assistant, updates for its Android and Workspaces platforms, and an overhaul of its flagship Search product. The announcements are part of Google’s broader effort to reestablish itself as Silicon Valley’s AI leader after it was caught off guard by Microsoft’s (MSFT) partnership with OpenAI in 2022. The new products also come a day after OpenAI unveiled its GPT-4o AI model and days before rivals Microsoft and Apple (AAPL) debut their own major generative AI updates. The biggest announcement is that Google is updating its Search platform to include generative AI results at the top of the screen. The feature, which was originally available as part of a preview in the company's Search Labs, is now coming to all US users and rolling out globally in the coming future. Another one of the biggest announcements was a new, personalized AI assistant called Gemini Live. The feature, powered by the company’s Gemini 1.5 Pro model, will allow you to speak directly to the assistant on your mobile device, providing you with responses in a number of natural-sounding voices. On the Android front, Google says it's expanding the assistant to interact with apps like Google Messages and Gmail, allowing users, for example, to drag and drop generated images from Gemini into texts and emails. Users can also use the app to ask specific questions about YouTube videos, and it will scour the video's captions to find an answer. Google is also updating its on-device version of Gemini, called Gemini Nano, with new multimodal features. Multimodal means that a generative AI model can work across mediums including text, images, and video. Google’s vice president of engineering for Gemini experiences, Amar Subramanya, told Yahoo Finance he’s been using Gemini Live for brainstorming, bouncing ideas off of the assistant. Subramanya said early testers have also been using Gemini Live for scenarios including translation. In the coming months, Google says Gemini Live will be able to access a user's cameras, allowing the assistant to interact with the real world and things it sees. OpenAI has also shown off these capabilities in demos of its GPT-4o. In one example, Subramanya said he asked the assistant to find a recipe for a pineapple upside-down cake for 15 people and add the ingredients to his Keep shopping list. The assistant found a recipe for eight people, scaled the proportions from eight to 15 people, and put the items Subramanya needed to put it together into his shopping list."

Google fights $17 bln UK lawsuit over adtech practices,"LONDON, May 8 (Reuters) - Google parent Alphabet has urged a London tribunal to block a mass lawsuit which accuses it of abusing its dominance in the online advertising market, in the latest case to focus on the search giant's business practices. The lawsuit seeks damages of up to 13.6 billion pounds ($16.9 billion) on behalf of publishers of websites and apps based in the United Kingdom, who say they have suffered losses due to Google's allegedly anticompetitive behaviour. Lawyers for Ad Tech Collective Action asked the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) to certify the case to proceed towards a trial at the start of a three-day hearing on Wednesday. Google, however, said the case was incoherent and did not explain how alleged anticompetitive conduct had supposedly caused losses to the publishers. Ad Tech Collective Action's lawyer Robert O'Donoghue said the London lawsuit was ""the latest in a series of major set-preferencing abuse cases involving Google"". The case comes amid ongoing probes by regulators into Google's adtech business, including by Britain's Competition and Markets Authority and the European Commission, which O'Donoghue said was concluding imminently. O'Donoghue also referred to two multibillion-euro fines levied on Google by the European Commission, over its online shopping search service and the requirement to pre-install Google Search and its Chrome browser on Android mobile devices. Google is also fighting two lawsuits in the U.S., one brought by the Department of Justice and another by Texas and other states, accusing the company of anticompetitive conduct. The company ""strongly rejects the underlying allegations against it"", its lawyers said in court documents for the CAT case. ""Google's impact in the ad tech industry has been hugely procompetitive."" Ad Tech Collective Action's proposed lawsuit is the latest against a tech giant at the CAT, which already this year has certified a $3.8 billion case against Facebook parent Meta and a nearly $1 billion case against Apple.

Huawei flagship store surge in China signals showdown with Apple,"By Josh Ye HONG KONG (Reuters) - Huawei is revamping its retail strategy and aggressively opening flagship stores in China, with some just a stone's throw away from Apple shops, as it seeks to retake the premium electronics throne in the world's biggest smartphone market. Situated directly across from Apple's Shanghai flagship store, Huawei's recently renovated shop spans three floors of a famous heritage architecture building in the financial hub's busy shopping district and includes a coffee shop and a gym. Huawei opened four such stores in major Chinese cities between December and February, an aggressive marketing blitz by a company that had largely relied on licensed distributors and is rebounding from U.S. sanctions imposed in 2019 that had crippled its smartphone business for four years until it could source domestic replacement parts. ""The Huawei flagship store is very nice. It looks much brighter inside compared to the Apple Store across the street,"" said Amy Chen, a 27-year-old physiotherapist who visited the Shanghai store this week to switch to Huawei's top-end Pura 70 Ultra from the iPhone 15 Pro in hopes of better mobile reception. Apple has 47 stores in mainland China. Huawei, which did not open a flagship store until 2019, now has 11 of them. ""I think they will open more than 20 of them. Then it will eventually catch up to Apple,"" said Ethan Qi, associate director at research firm Counterpoint. It marks a stark contrast to 2021 when the company's licensed stores were shuttered across China due to product shortages caused by the U.S. sanctions. Huawei has since developed its own chips, introduced highly popular 5G-capable products and, according to sources, has started aggressively recruiting dealers in recent months. ""As Huawei now manages to ship in large quantities, given the good profit margin they could provide, (distributors) have become willing to purchase Huawei devices again,"" Qi said. ""Previously, many couldn't get stock and their 4G devices didn't sell well."""

Microsoft debuts new Copilot+ PCs using OpenAI's GPT-4o while taking shots at Apple,"Microsoft (MSFT) is going all in on AI for the PC. The company on Monday announced a new category of PCs called Copilot+ PCs, a new variety of computers equipped with so-called AI PC chips and running Microsoft's latest version of Windows 11 and its Copilot AI software. Microsoft also revealed that its Copilot+ PCs will now run on OpenAI's GPT-4o model, allowing the assistant to interact with your PC via text, video, and voice. Users will also be able to share their screen with Copilot and have a natural conversation with the app. ""The richest AI experiences will harness the power of the cloud and the edge working together in concert. This in turn will lead to a new category of devices that turn the world itself into a prompt,"" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said on Monday. ""For us, this vision starts with our most beloved and most widely used canvas: Windows."" Microsoft's new PC push comes as the PC market enters the early innings of a turnaround after two years of declines. According to IDC, PC shipments grew 1.5% in the first quarter, compared to a 28.7% decline during the same time in 2023. Yusuf Mehdi, Microsoft executive vice president and consumer chief marketing officer, said the company expects over 50 million AI PCs to be purchased over the next year. Copilot+ PCs are an offshoot of AI PCs, which are generally defined as PCs running on Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), and Qualcomm (QCOM) chips with built-in neural processing units, or neural engines, that can run generative AI applications locally without needing to connect to the internet. Copilot+ PCs will include 16GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage to ensure performance. In a pre-recorded demonstration of Copilot's GPT-4o integration, a user fired up the game Minecraft and asked Copilot how to craft a sword. The assistant could see what the user was doing in the game and walk him through everything he needed to do to build the item. Microsoft says it will integrate Copilot for a number of gaming apps, and because it will run on your PC's NPU rather than its GPU, it shouldn't hurt overall performance."
4 Top Stocks to Tap Nasdaq's New All-Time High,"The Nasdaq Composite witnessed a robust 2023 and first quarter of 2024. The bull run has also continued into the second quarter despite growing concerns over inflation. On May 14, the tech-heavy Nasdaq ended 0.8% higher to close at a new record high of 16,511.18 points. The index has rallied 10% year to date after jumping 43.4% in 2023 to record its best year since 2020. This year, so far, has been great for Wall Street, with the Dow and the S&P 500 also notching record highs in February. The Nasdaq was a shade slow in catching up but finally hit an all-time high in February. The index has since had a solid run and May particularly has been great. The rally comes despite growing concerns over inflation and rising uncertainty over rate cuts. This year, the Nasdaq’s dream run has primarily been driven by the enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI. While the opinions of experts on the prospects of generative AI vary, significant enthusiasm surrounding the field has been noticed over the past year. Many believe that AI is still at a nascent stage and its full potential is yet to be realized. Once this potential is unlocked, AI is expected to create significant business opportunities for technology companies to produce premium products and, in turn, boost their stocks. Besides, the development of smart devices is contributing to the growth of the AI space, as they require computing and learning capabilities for tasks like face detection, image recognition, and video analytics. These functions require high processing power, speed, memory, low power consumption, and improved graphic processors and solutions, all of which create favorable conditions for the semiconductor industry’s growth. Moreover, while uncertainty over rate cuts raised concerns, the Federal Reserve said earlier this month that any further interest rate hike is unlikely. High-interest rates have a negative impact on growth assets such as technology stocks, and the Federal Reserve’s comments were cheered by investors."
"AMD Positions for AI Leadership with Expanded Portfolio, Quadrupled R&D Investment Ahead of Major Computex Announcements","Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) is strategically preparing to address the growing demand for AI computing by leveraging its extensive product range.

The Next AI Bull Run Just Started: 3 Top Ranked Stocks to Ride the Trend,"Yes, I know the last year has been all AI every day, but this theme is still early days. Exciting new products built from generative AI models are just beginning to come to market and will continue to change the way we interact with technology. Just this week there were two significant releases from both Microsoft’s MSFT OpenAI, and Alphabet GOOGL. Additionally, now that broad markets have traded sideways for the better part of two months, energy has been built for a major breakout in the leading names. These product releases should be a valuable catalyst for the next big rally. New AI Product Releases OpenAI introduced the newest iteration of their primary AI model, GPT-4o. The demonstrations of GPT-4o were extremely impressive, with one video showing the AI model interacting with and tutoring a young boy on his math homework. The GPT, young boy and father were all in conversation with each other, and the GPT helped him through the process in a supportive and logical way. It was really something, and I recommend those interested seek out some of the most recent demonstrations released online. Then, at Google I/O, Alphabet’s annual developer conference, the company introduced its newest AI enabled “Agents,” built throughout its platforms. This product is built on Gemini, Alphabet’s response to OpenAI’s GPT. In one demo, the presenter wanted to return a pair of shoes they bought online. They took a picture of them, and said to the agent, “I want to return these shoes, they don’t fit.” Gemini proceeded to find the order info in Gmail, fill out a return form, and scheduled a pickup from UPS. It really functioned like a personal assistant. The presentation also showed Gemini agents planning detailed trips catered to specific interests, summarizing long email chains, and working across multiple external websites to really simplify workflow. Again, I recommend those interested go watch the demo videos."
India's Redington posts 5% rise in quarterly profit on gadgets demand,"BENGALURU, May 15 (Reuters) - Indian IT products distributor Redington reported a 5% rise in quarterly profit on Wednesday, aided by demand for mobile phones and computers in its key markets. The Apple and Samsung gadgets distributor's consolidated net profit climbed to 3.26 billion rupees ($39.06 million) for the fourth quarter ended March 31, according to a regulatory filing. Affluent Indians are increasingly spending more than 30,000 rupees ($361.30) on new smartphones, benefiting manufacturers and distributors such as Redington. Global personal computer sales also show signs of recovery after inflation-hit customers delayed system upgrades for several quarters. Revenue from operations for Redington rose nearly 3% to 224.33 billion rupees, benefiting from an 8% growth in its SISA segment, which includes Singapore, India and South Asia. Revenue from its consumer and commercial personal computers, print and supplies business in SISA rose 10% in the quarter, while its smartphones and feature phones business in the region recorded a 6% growth. The growth in SISA made up a 2% decline in revenue from the rest of the world for the company, which has a presence in 31 countries, including Rwanda, Oman and Turkey.

"Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) sheds 13% this week, as yearly returns fall more in line with earnings growth","Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) shareholders might be concerned after seeing the share price drop 13% in the last week. But in stark contrast, the returns over the last half decade have impressed. In fact, the share price is 127% higher today. To some, the recent pullback wouldn't be surprising after such a fast rise. Of course, that doesn't necessarily mean it's cheap now. Since the long term performance has been good but there's been a recent pullback of 13%, let's check if the fundamentals match the share price.  See our latest analysis for Meta Platforms  While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS). Over half a decade, Meta Platforms managed to grow its earnings per share at 22% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 18% over the same period. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days. The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers). We know that Meta Platforms has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained. It's good to see that Meta Platforms has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 80% in the last twelve months. And that does include the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 18% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Meta Platforms that you should be aware of before investing here. For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.

Is NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) The Best Jim Cramer Stock to Buy Now?,"Jim Cramer has been a big believer in NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), recommending the stock almost every week since late 2023. However, amid the recent lackluster performance of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Cramer sounded a bit disappointed, saying the stock now seems to “rally far less than it goes down.” However, Cramer reiterated that he believes NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a stock to own, not trade. Despite concerns around valuation, Wall Street continues to shower positive ratings on NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA). Recently, Wells Fargo’s Aaron Rakers increased his price target for NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) to $1,150 from $970, citing data center strengths. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) bulls believe the company is just getting started since we are in a very early stage of AI adaption phase where companies are testing their AI products.  NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is currently the leader in the AI chips industry with an 84% market share. Don't Miss: 11 Best Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy Now According to Hedge Funds As of the end of the last quarter of 2023, 173 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA). The most significant stake in NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is owned by Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners which owns a $6.8 billion stake in NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA). Patient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter: “This quarter we entered two new positions, while exiting four positions. Our first new position was NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which we bought early in the quarter. Nvidia is the market leader in designing and selling Graphics Processing Units (GPU), which has recently benefited from the insatiable demand of artificial intelligence (AI) models. The company currently captures 92% market share of data center GPUs and grew revenue, earnings and FCF an astounding 126%, 392%, and 610%, respectively, over the last year. While much of the focus is on Nvidia’s market cap reaching $2.3T, up 230% over the last year, the company’s valuation has actually come down over that period. As of 3/31/23, consensus was valuing the company at 61x forward EPS. This compares to today, where the company is being valued at 37x. While yes, we have never seen a company expand their market cap by so much so quickly, we have also never seen a company grow their fundamental earnings and cash generation so quickly (and which is actually expanding faster than valuation). While competitors are working to enter the GPU space, Nvidia has created a moat around their GPUs with their CUDA software offering. While we do expect the large cloud players to continue to move into the market, we think NVDA can continue to demand top market share. With leading edge technology, an increasing innovation cycle and strong cash generation, the company is well positioned for the increased adoption of accelerated computing and artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) was a top performer in the quarter gaining 82.5% in the period. While the company has had an impressive run, gaining 242% over the last year, the valuation has been supported by the impressive growth in Revenue (126%), EPS (392%) and free cash flow (610%) over the last year. The company has solidified its position in the GPU space supported by its proprietary software CUDA. While we expect competition to increase, we think NVDA can continue to maintain top market share. With leading edge technology, an increasing innovation cycle and strong cash generation, the company is well positioned for the increased adoption of artificial intelligence (AI).”  Despite these growth catalysts and AI opportunities, NVDA is not the best Jim Cramer stock to buy now, according to Insider Monkey's research.   Click to see 3 Best Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy That are Better Than Nvidia.

Amazon (AMZN) Q1 Earnings and Revenues Top Estimates,"Amazon (AMZN) came out with quarterly earnings of $1.13 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.83 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.31 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 36.14%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this online retailer would post earnings of $0.81 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.01, delivering a surprise of 24.69%. Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times. Amazon , which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, posted revenues of $143.31 billion for the quarter ended March 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.55%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $127.36 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. Amazon shares have added about 19.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 7.3%. What's Next for Amazon? While Amazon has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions."
Amazon Web Services CEO to step down,"Amazon’s biggest moneymaker, Amazon Web Services, is getting a new leader. Adam Selipsky, the chief executive of the cloud computing unit, will step down from his role next month, the company announced Tuesday. Selipsky, who first joined AWS in 2005 — before its services were even publicly available — has led the business since 2021, when previous AWS CEO Andy Jassy was promoted to lead all of Amazon. Matt Garman, currently vice president of sales, marketing and global services, will take over as AWS CEO starting June 3. The leader of AWS is of major consequence to the larger company, as the cloud computing business makes up nearly two-thirds of Amazon’s overall profits. And with annual revenue of more than $90 billion last year, AWS is larger than many standalone companies. AWS is also at a pivotal moment with the growth of artificial intelligence, as it rolls out new tools and capacity in hopes of becoming the computing provider of choice for the next wave of technology. But it faces fierce competition from other major players, including Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure. Amazon Web Services’ sales have grown more than 85% since Selipsky’s takeover. Amazon shares dipped more than 1% Tuesday following the announcement. However, Jassy said in an email to staff Tuesday that Selipsky’s tenure was always meant to be short-lived. Jassy said that when he left AWS to become Amazon CEO, “we had strong leaders in AWS, several of whom could lead the overall business in the long-term, but who’d benefit from a few more years gaining experience and learning under a more seasoned CEO.” He added that in speaking with Selipsky about taking the job back in 2021, “we agreed that if he accepted the role, he’d likely do it for a few years, and that one of the things he’d focus on during that time was helping prepare the next generation of leadership. We were fortunate that Adam agreed to step in and lead AWS, and has deftly led the business, while also developing his leadership team,” Jassy said. “I’m humbled by the many customers who have said they wouldn’t be what they are without AWS, thankful to our many partners, and grateful to my passionate and innovative teammates. AWS will be in great hands with Matt and the incredible leadership team,” Selipsky said in a post on X Tuesday. Even before Selipsky’s takeover, Garman had been considered by analysts to be among the top frontrunners for AWS CEO."
Pinterest CEO says the platform uses AI to generate positivity,"Pinterest is standing out from the crowd by using AI to create positive experiences for users, says its CEO. “We’re trying to prove that you can use AI for good,” CEO Bill Ready said to Yahoo Finance at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills on Monday. “We've really invested in making Pinterest a more positive alternative to traditional social media,"" he added. ""And when you ask Gen Z, they will tell you that they see Pinterest as an oasis away from the toxicity that they see on much of the rest of social media.” The social media company has been incorporating a suite of ""inclusive AI"" technologies into its platform that help make search results more representative of different body types and skin tones. Though the potential TikTok ban has been making headlines, Ready said, “We're not sitting back hoping for the demise of other platforms.” Pinterest was founded in 2008 as a visual discovery platform where users can search and save ideas. Over the years, the company has evolved into offering users shoppable content. “Pinterest is where Gen Z goes to shop,” said Ready about the platform's largest demographic. “Over the last two years, we've really been opening the stores, making it really easy for users to connect to the things that they find on Pinterest.” Pinterest reported massive first quarter earnings last week, beating analyst estimates on almost every metric. Revenue jumped 23% year over year, its best growth in three years. Global monthly active users increased to 518 million, an all-time high and a 12% jump from last year. The company cut its losses to $24.8 million this quarter, compared to $208.6 million last year. The stock is up over 90% in the past year. Pinterest has also been investing heavily in its advertising business, striking partnerships with Google and Amazon. ""When you step back from it all, Pinterest is firing on all cylinders,"" Ready said."
"Trending tickers: Chubb, Nvidia, Microsoft, BT and EasyJet","Shares in the Swiss insurer surged in pre-market trading after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) disclosed a major stake in the company. Berkshire revealed it acquired nearly 26 million shares of Chubb in a Wednesday Securities and Exchange Commission filing of the company’s first-quarter investments. That translates to a value of approximately $6.7bn (£5.28bn). Berkshire had requested confidential treatment from the Securities and Exchange Commission in the third and fourth quarter of last year for one or more of its equity holdings. The treatment was sought presumably because Buffett wanted to accumulate Chubb without tipping off other investors and potentially boosting the price of Chubb shares. ""Chubb is an attractive equity investment for Berkshire because it operates in a business Berkshire knows well: property-casualty insurance,"" Cathy Seifert, a CFRA Research analyst who covers Berkshire, said in an email reported by Reuters. The company led by the ‘Oracle of Omaha’ also announced it was eliminating its stake in HP (HPQ). Shares in the chipmaker were higher in pre-market trading after KeyBanc Capital Markets said it sees limited signs of a demand pause for the company. This comes ahead of Nvidia's first-quarter results next week. Consensus expectations on Wall Street are for Nvidia to report revenue of $24.51bn. But to avoid disappointing investors, KeyBanc analyst John Vinh said, the chipmaker will need to report revenue of around $26bn and give guidance for its second quarter of around $28.5bn. Read more: Mag 7 stocks including Apple and Amazon still holding strong “Despite anticipation of next-generation Blackwell GPUs [graphics-processing units] in the second half, we see limited signs of a demand pause and expect Nvidia to report first-quarter results and second-quarter guidance meaningfully above expectations,” wrote Vinh in a research note. The company will post its first-quarter results on May 22. Shares have drifted from a range of $850 to $950 since late March."
"Take Five: The good, the bad and the ugly","(Reuters) - Markets are hoping for evidence that will solidify a brightening global economic outlook, though rising trade tensions are casting a cloud, while G7 finance ministers gather in Italy. AI darling Nvidia reports results, London has its sights on a revival in stock listings, while New Zealand's central bank is stuck in rut between lacklustre growth and sticky inflation. Here's your look at what's happening in markets this coming week from Kevin Buckland in Tokyo, Lewis Krauskopf in New York, and Anousha Sakoui, Dhara Ranasinghe and Karin Strohecker in London. 1/ CLOUDS ON HORIZON Upcoming May business activity numbers from big economies should reinforce a brighter global economic outlook. A slow euro area recovery appears to be underway after six straight quarters of stagnant or negative growth, U.S. inflation just resumed its downward trend and China grew faster than expected in Q1. So, global PMIs should stay on the right side of the 50 divider between expansion and contraction. Yet steep U.S. tariff increases on Chinese imports from electric vehicle batteries to computer chips highlight a fragile outlook for global trade and growth. China vows retaliation. Manufacturers in Germany, Europe's biggest economy, are already experiencing shifts in world trade and geopolitics. Heightened trade tensions - with a U.S. election looming - could hurt them further, upend China's recovery and reignite U.S. inflation. Global PMIs are pointing up for now. But that could easily change. 2/ CHIP TIME"
Meta’s stock plunges 15% on ‘aggressive’ AI spending plans,"Shares in Meta plunged Thursday, as the Facebook owner’s plans to “invest aggressively” in artificial intelligence spooked investors. The stock fell as much as 15% to $421.40 when the Nasdaq opened, wiping $183 billion off its market value. The selloff, which started in after-hours trade Wednesday, came as investors looked beyond bumper first-quarter earnings to focus on the huge costs to the company of building an AI future. Meta (META) is competing head-to-head with Microsoft and Google to unlock the enormous potential of AI. While the payoffs could be huge, the company’s most recent earnings underscored that building the best tools is costly and will take time. Meta, which also owns WhatsApp and Instagram, said Wednesday that first-quarter profit more than doubled year-on-year, while revenue was up 27%. But an increase of as much as $5 billion in projected AI investments — and the likelihood of further increases in subsequent years — made shareholders uneasy. “The language around spending plans has become bolder once more, and this could be what’s spooking markets,” Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, wrote in a note Thursday. “For all Meta’s bold AI plans, it can’t afford to take its eye off the nucleus of the business — its core advertising activities… Meta’s resources are vast but not infinite, and its digital advertising market share needs defending at all costs,” she added. Meta said full-year capital expenditure would be in the range of $35-40 billion — up from previous guidance of $30-37 billion — as it continues to accelerate infrastructure investments to support AI. “We expect capital expenditures will continue to increase next year as we invest aggressively to support our ambitious AI research and product development efforts,” the company added in a statement. On a call with investors, CEO Mark Zuckerberg focused most of his comments on AI. He said Meta wants to be “the leading AI company in the world” and “should invest significantly more over the coming years to build even more advanced models.” Meta would increase spending “meaningfully before we make much revenue from some of these new products… On the upside, once our new AI services reach scale, we have a strong track record of monetizing them effectively,” he added."

Reported EPS is $0.978, expectations were $0.82. Operator: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com First Quarter 2024 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After a presentation, we’ll conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. And for opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dave Fildes. Please go ahead. Dave Fildes: Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2024 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Andy Jassy, our CEO; and Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2023. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 30, 2024, only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, cloud services and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now I'll turn the call over to Andy. Andy Jassy: Thanks, Dave. Today, we're reporting $143.3 billion in revenue, up 13% year-over-year, excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates; $15.3 billion in operating income, up 221% year-over-year or $10.5 billion; and $48.8 billion in trailing 12-month free cash flow adjusted for equipment finance leases, up $53.2 billion year-over-year. We remain focused on driving better experiences for our customers while also delivering efficiency improvements. Our financial results are an encouraging reminder of the progress we're making. Starting with our stores business, despite having hundreds of millions of items and the broadest selection available, we remain intensely focused on adding even more selection. One way is to continue adding brands we know our customers want. For instance, in the US, we recently welcomed Clinique and two Gen Z fashion favorites, Parade and Cider, and announced a collaboration with Hardly Ever Worn It in Europe to offer customers pre-owned items from luxury brands. Another way to drive selection is to make it easier for our third-party sellers to add their products to our store. We've recently launched a new generative AI tool that enables sellers to simply provide a URL to their own website, and we automatically create high-quality product detail pages on Amazon. Already, over 100,000 of our selling partners have used one or more of our GenAI tools. We remain focused on making sure we're offering everyday low prices, which we know is even more important to our customers in this uncertain economic environment. As our results show, customers are shopping but remain cautious, trading down on price when they can and seeking out deals. In Q1, we helped customers save with shopping events worldwide, including our first big spring sale in Canada and the US. We also held spring deal days in Europe and our Ramadan event in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. Delivery speed really matters to customers, and we've continued to get faster while improving our safety performance. In this past Q1, we delivered to Prime members at our fastest speeds ever. In March, across our top 60 largest US metro areas, nearly 60% of Prime members orders arrived the same or next day. And globally, in cities like Toronto, London, and Tokyo, about three out of four items were delivered the same or next day. Faster delivery times have another important effect. As we get items to customers this fast, customers choose Amazon to fulfill their shopping needs more frequently, and we can see the results in various areas, including how fast our Everyday Essentials business is growing and the continued increase in Prime member purchase frequency and total spend with us. Over the past year, we've talked about how our regionalization efforts have helped to lower our cost to serve. We've continued to inspect our fulfillment network for additional opportunities and are working on several areas where we believe we can lower costs even further while also improving customer experience. One example of this is our work to increase the consolidation of units into fewer boxes."

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to 5 Biggest Publicly Traded AI Companies in the World. On May 8, Stuart Kaiser, Citi's Head of Equity Trading Strategy, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance where he discussed the role of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in shaping the market for artificial intelligence. Kaiser suggests that the company's earnings report may be the biggest event to look forward to right now, especially for equity holders, according to the S&P 500 index. He also highlighted that if the 10-year rate was pinned at 4.75%, equities would not be largely impacted if NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) misses earnings on May 22nd. The interviewer then directs the conversation to discuss the volatility of the stock. The stock went down to $735 and $740 a couple of weeks ago, to which Kaiser emphasized how NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) poses a macro risk to the market, keeping in mind that it is priced for a significant swing of 10%. Companies like Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) went down double digitals, and big tech stocks, now stabilized, also have been down in correlation. To put NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) position into perspective, the company's earnings report and the way big and small tech companies react to it are extremely crucial to the AI space at the moment. The interviewer then questions how megacap tech stocks upheld their leadership position in the market.

Should You Buy the Dip in Semiconductor Stocks With ETFs?,"The semiconductor sector, which was riding high on AI optimism, faltered last month on growing concerns about the long-term demand outlook for semiconductors and weak demand from China. The series of weak earnings from AI players like Advanced Micro Devices AMD and Super Micro Computer SMCI was the latest blow, resulting in a sell-off in the broader sector on May 1. Notably, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index dropped 3.5% on the day (read: Can Q1 Earnings Results Recharge Semiconductor ETFs?). AMD offered downbeat guidance for 2024 sales of its newly released AI chip, which pushed the stock down 9%. Though the company raised its revenue target for MI300 to at least $4 billion from $3.5 billion, Wall Street was looking for a bigger boost from the accelerator business. At least 12 analysts cut their price targets on AMD stock after the company's first-quarter report. However, some analysts are still positive about the company’s growth prospects. They believe that easing supply chain constraints would allow the company to increase its share in the AI chip market and potentially reap billions of dollars in revenues.Super Micro Computer plunged 14% following its revenue miss amid concerns over the profitability of a new line of servers. However, some analysts raised the target price on the stock following its results, stating that AI is still in the early stages and will continue to grow.The performance of the duo caused some disappointment, resulting in a decline in other semiconductor stocks. Nvidia NVDA, which is at the forefront of AI innovations, fell 5.7%. Notably, the three stocks erased a collective $143 billion in market value. Chipmakers like Micron Technology MU and Marvell Technology MRVL slid 2.9% and 3.6%, respectively (read: What's Ahead for Nvidia ETFs?).Skyworks SWKS stock tumbled 15.3% after the company provided weak revenue guidance on demand concerns as clients struggled to offload excess inventory. The terrible trading in the stock world sent the semiconductor ETFs space into red on the day. VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF SMH, iShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX, Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF SOXQ, Strive U.S. Semiconductor ETF SHOC and First Trust NASDAQ Semiconductor ETF FTXL have lost around 3% each on the day.SMHVanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF follows the MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index and holds 26 stocks in its basket.

FTXL holds 31 stocks in its basket and charges 60 bps in annual fees. First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF has $1.4 billion in AUM. Despite the slide, the outlook for the sector is promising. The semiconductor index is still clearly outpacing the broader market index on a year-to-date basis. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is up 8% in the year-to-date time frame compared with a gain of 5.2% for the S&P 500. The sector is also enjoying a strong rally over the past year, gaining more than 53% compared with 23.6% for the S&P 500.This trend is likely to continue thanks to the rapid development of AI, which will continue to fuel a surge in demand for semiconductor products, driven by its applications in data processing, pattern recognition and machine learning. According to a new report by Grand View Research, the global artificial intelligence market is expected to witness a CAGR (2024-2030) of 36.6% to $811.75 billion by 2030 (read: 4 ETFs to Tap the Renewed AI Craze on Wall Street).Semiconductors have been the most important drivers of the overall growth in technology, given the use of chips in day-to-day life, from cars and electronic gadgets to planes and weapons. Demand will continue to trend higher, given increased digitization in various corners like healthcare, transport, financial systems, defense, agriculture and retail, among others. The rapid adoption of cutting-edge technology like cloud, Internet of Things, autonomous cars, gaming, wearables, VR headsets, drones, virtual reality devices, cryptocurrencies, 5G and other advanced information technologies should continue to fuel growth. Further, the introduction of expensive and new-generation chips has been driving an enhancement in the product mix for semiconductors.Further, the abovementioned five ETFs have a top Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy), suggesting that these will outperform the broad market. Additionally, these products have exposure to a number of firms in various types of industries, suggesting that these can easily counter shocks from some of the industry’s biggest components.Given the strong industry fundamentals and the diversification benefits of ETFs, investors may want to consider the recent slump a buying opportunity.

Shareholders aren't just seeing their stock prices swell, they are getting paid too. The dividend, its importance demoted over the past couple of decades by the tech boom, is having a moment again thanks in part to the same companies that made it passé. In February, META (META) initiated a dividend, and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) followed in April. And then came an increase from Apple (AAPL) last week. But why are tech companies initiating payouts, and why now? The dividend trend reflects the double role that tech giants hold in society and on Wall Street.

Logitech (LOGI) to Report Q4 Earnings: What's in the Offing?,"Logitech International LOGI is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Apr 29. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 revenues is pegged at $951.9 million, which indicates a marginal decrease of 0.9% from the year-ago quarter. The consensus mark for non-GAAP earnings stands at 61 cents per share, which suggests a robust increase of 22% from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 50 cents. Earnings estimates for the fourth quarter have remained unchanged in the past 60 days. The company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 39.8%. Let’s see how things have shaped up before the upcoming announcement. Logitech International S.A. price-eps-surprise | Logitech International S.A. Quote Logitech’s fiscal fourth-quarter earnings are likely to have been negatively impacted by the softened demand for personal computers (PCs), the main sales booster for its PC peripheral products. Per the latest International Data Corporation report, worldwide PC shipments improved 1.5% year over year in the first quarter of 2024. However, this growth was largely achieved due to easy year-over-year comparisons as PC shipments declined 28.7% in the year-ago quarter. In 2020 and 2021, Logitech benefited from the elevated demand for its Video Collaboration, PC Webcams, Keyboards & Combos and Pointing Device tools, mainly driven by the heightening of work-from-home and learn-from-home trends. However, the weak global economy amid ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical issues enhanced global recessionary concerns, thereby prompting enterprises to postpone their large IT spending plans. Furthermore, continued industry layoffs due to growing recessionary concerns are hampering the demand for PC peripheral products by organizations. Additionally, a lack of the need for product refreshes is expected to negatively impact the demand for Logitech’s products in the to-be-reported quarter. The majority of the global working population refreshed PCs and related peripheral products about two years ago in the wake of the pandemic-led work-from-home trend. Our estimates for Logitech’s Video Collaboration and Keyboards & Combos fourth-quarter revenues are pegged at $141.2 million and $184 million, respectively. The estimated revenue figures for Video Collaboration and Keyboards & Combos depict a year-over-year decline of 1.9% and 2%, respectively."
CORRECTED-US lawmakers unveil bill to make it easier to restrict exports of AI models,"(Corrects to show Susan Wild, not Max Wise, cosponsored the bill in second paragraph) WASHINGTON, May 9 (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of lawmakers unveiled a bill late Wednesday that would make it easier for the Biden administration to impose export controls on AI models, in a bid to safeguard the prized U.S. technology against foreign bad actors. The bill, sponsored by House Republicans Michael McCaul and John Molenaar and Democrats Raja Krishnamoorthi and Susan Wild, would also give the Commerce Department express authority to bar Americans from working with foreigners to develop AI systems that pose risks to U.S. national security. The legislation aims to bulletproof any future AI export regulations from legal challenges. It comes as worries mount that U.S. adversaries could use the models, which mine vast amounts of text and images to summarize information and generate content, to wage aggressive cyber attacks or even create potent biological weapons. Reuters reported on Wednesday that the United States is poised to open up a new front in its effort to safeguard U.S. AI from China and Russia with preliminary plans to impose export controls on the most advanced proprietary AI Models. But under existing U.S. law, it is much more difficult for the Commerce Department, which oversees U.S. export policy, to regulate the export of open source AI models, which can be freely downloaded. If approved, the measure would remove roadblocks to regulating the export of open source AI contained in the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and also give the Commerce Department express authority to regulate AI systems. China has been heavily relying on many open source models developed in the West such as Meta Platforms’ “Llama” series. In March, the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence, a high-level research lab, was quoted by Chinese state media as stating that the majority of homegrown Chinese AI models were in fact built using Meta's Llama models and that this posed a key challenge to China's AI development. In November 2023, 01.AI, one of the most high-profile AI unicorns in China founded by Google’s former executive Lee Kai-fu, faced a major backlash after some AI engineers found that its AI model Yi-34B was built on Meta’s Llama system."
16 Biggest Publicly Traded AI Companies in the World,"In this article, we will take a look at the 16 biggest publicly traded AI companies in the world. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to 5 Biggest Publicly Traded AI Companies in the World. On May 8, Stuart Kaiser, Citi's Head of Equity Trading Strategy, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance where he discussed the role of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in shaping the market for artificial intelligence. Kaiser suggests that the company's earnings report may be the biggest event to look forward to right now, especially for equity holders, according to the S&P 500 index. He also highlighted that if the 10-year rate was pinned at 4.75%, equities would not be largely impacted if NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) misses earnings on May 22nd. The interviewer then directs the conversation to discuss the volatility of the stock. The stock went down to $735 and $740 a couple of weeks ago, to which Kaiser emphasized how NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) poses a macro risk to the market, keeping in mind that it is priced for a significant swing of 10%. Companies like Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) went down double digitals, and big tech stocks, now stabilized, also have been down in correlation. To put NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) position into perspective, the company's earnings report and the way big and small tech companies react to it are extremely crucial to the AI space at the moment. The interviewer then questions how megacap tech stocks upheld their leadership position in the market. The interviewer highlights that the NASDAQ 100 hit a high in July last year and mid-January this year, and has been sideways since, relative to the S&P 500 index. Kaiser highlights the magnificent seven including, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet Inc.

"Reddit is maturing as a company, CEO says","Reddit (RDDT) is entering its adult years, and that may turn out well for investors. ""A lot of things are really starting to click,"" Reddit co-founder and CEO Steve Huffman told Yahoo Finance on Thursday (video above). The company this week reported its first results since going public in late March — and there was much to prove the bears wrong. Daily active users increased 37% year over year to 82.7 million. Weekly active unique users rose 40% from the prior year. Total revenue improved 48% to $243 million, nearly doubling the growth rate from the prior quarter, due to strength in advertising. The company delivered adjusted operating profits of $10 million, versus a $50.2 million loss a year ago. Huffman declined to say when the company would be profitable on a net income basis, noting it's a focus for the management team. Other areas of focus include rolling out a new user interface this year, introducing shopping capabilities, and searching for another artificial intelligence content licensing deal like the one with Google (GOOG, GOOGL). ""Results this quarter show that Reddit is on the early end of a number of positive inflections: Top-of-funnel growth is accelerating, the ad platform is in the early stages of being built to address lower funnel objectives, the data licensing business is in the very early stages of growth, and the company is entering a harvest period in costs after aggressively adding to headcount over the last couple years,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Benjamin Black said in a client note. For Reddit, the quarter was another win for 2024. Initially expected to price its IPO in the $31 to $34 per share range, Reddit ended up pricing its IPO at $34 in late March, giving it a $6.4 billion valuation. The targeted valuation on a fully diluted basis was less than the $10 billion it fetched in a 2021 funding round. The stock began trading at $47 per share and quickly shot past $53."
25 Most Profitable Companies in the US,"In this piece, we will take a look at the 25 most profitable companies in the US. If you want to skip our overview of the US economy and the current business climate, you can jump ahead to the 5 Most Profitable Companies in the US.  With the second quarter of 2024 with us, Wall Street is focused on determining whether companies that are investing in AI are actually bringing in money or whether they are investing costly capital to set themselves up for future growth. Firms that belong to the former sector, i.e. those that are making money from AI, have been rewarded as has been the case with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). Just like NVIDIA is Wall Street's favorite AI stock when it comes to semiconductors needed to power up large data processing software, Microsoft is the king of the jungle when it comes to AI software. In the latter segment, the best example is Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) whose shares have dropped after the latest earnings report revealed that 2024 will require an additional $40 billion in capital to fund AI growth. This sharp eye on AI comes when investors are grappling with an economy that might be starting to slow down just as the Federal Reserve finds it difficult to tamp down on inflation. While the AI gold rush of 2023 put inflation and other macroeconomic indicators on the backdrop, after the inflation data for March 2024, they are back in the spotlight. This environment, which has left investors eager to flee away from stocks once again comes as profitability becomes key, particularly as profits are important to enable firms to position themselves for growth (such as is the case with AI stocks) or keep investors happy by paying out dividends. US companies are also some of the biggest in the world when it comes to profits. America's corporate sector, particularly the technology industry, is the most developed in the world. Firms such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) are able to compete with the world's largest state owned enterprises when it comes to revenue. In fact, Apple is the first company in the world that has proven that technology and personal computing is a more lucrative industry than oil - a commodity that is responsible for powering daily lives. To understand how, consider that Apple's trailing twelve month revenue as of December 2023 sits at a whopping $385 billion. Now, compare this with the net sales of the Saudi state owned oil giant Saudi Arabian Oil Company (TADAWUL:2222.SR), which has raked in SAR2 trillion during the same time period. Using an exchange rate of 3.75 SAR to a dollar leads to approximately $530 billion in revenue for the Saudi oil giant. While naturally, Aramco's revenue is higher since it does not have any comparable competitors on a global level, the fact that a consumer technology firm that is dependent not only on the need to stay abreast with innovation but also with what its rivals are doing is able to earn more than half of the revenue is something in itself to say the least. As a whole, Insider Monkey also looked at the 30 Largest Companies in the World by Revenue. This shows that US companies reign supreme even though Aramco enjoys free access to the vast global crude oil market. The US retail giant Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) tops this list courtesy of its $648 billion in sales, showing that a well run privately owned company has the full potential to take on massive state owned giants. But what about profits? After all, even if a firm makes hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue, its investors get nothing if money does not flow through the income statement and into retained earnings. Today, we'll look at some of the most profitable companies in America, with a couple of top picks being Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). Photo by Christian Dubovan on Unsplash Our Methodology For our list of the most profitable companies in the US, we ranked all publicly listed US firms by their trailing twelve month net income available on Yahoo Finance and picked out those with the highest profit."

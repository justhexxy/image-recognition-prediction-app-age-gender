Microsoft's AI chatbot will 'recall' everything you do on a PC,20/5/2024 21:55,"MATT O'BRIEN, MANUEL VALDESUpdated 20 May 2024 at 2:55 pm·3-min read","REDMOND, Wash. (AP) — Microsoft wants laptop users to get so comfortable with its artificial intelligence chatbot that it will remember everything you're doing on your computer and help figure out what you want to do next. The software giant on Monday revealed a new class of AI-imbued personal computers as it confronts heightened competition from Big Tech rivals in pitching generative AI technology that can compose documents, make images and serve as a lifelike personal assistant at work or home. The announcements ahead of Microsoft's annual Build developer conference centered on fusing its AI assistant, called Copilot, into the Windows operating system for PCs, where Microsoft already has the eyes of millions of consumers. The new features will include Windows Recall, giving the AI assistant what Microsoft describes as “photographic memory” of a person's virtual activity. Microsoft promises to protect users' privacy by giving them the option to filter out what they don't want tracked, and keeping the tracking on the device. It's a step toward machines that “instantly see us, hear, reason about our intent and our surroundings,” said CEO Satya Nadella. “We’re entering this new era where computers not only understand us, but can actually anticipate what we want and our intent,"" Nadella said at an event at the company's headquarters in Redmond, Washington. The conference that starts Tuesday in Seattle follows big AI announcements last week from rival Google, as well as Microsoft's close business partner OpenAI, which built the AI large language models on which Microsoft's Copilot is based. Google rolled out a retooled search engine that periodically puts AI-generated summaries over website links at the top of the results page; while also showing off a still-in-development AI assistant Astra that will be able to “see” and converse about things shown through a smartphone’s camera lens. ChatGPT-maker OpenAI unveiled a new version of its chatbot last week, demonstrating an AI voice assistant with human characteristics that can banter about what someone's wearing and even attempt to assess a person’s emotions. The voice sounded so much like Scarlett Johansson playing an AI character in the sci-fi movie “Her” that OpenAI dropped the voice from its collection Monday. OpenAI also rolled out a new desktop version of ChatGPT designed for Apple's Mac computers.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/microsofts-ai-chatbot-recall-everything-185736872.html,AAPL,0.25
Web3 Marketing Needs Some of Apple’s Secret Sauce,20/5/2024 14:23,Tomer Sharoni20 May 2024 at 7:23 am·4-min read,"The launch of Apple’s Vision Pro headset has been perhaps the most controversial in its recent history – certainly, the biggest pivot since the company moved into the telecommunications market with the launch of the iPhone in 2007. Presenting the innovation at the time, then-CEO Steve Jobs claimed that it would “reinvent the phone.” Boy, was he right. Current CEO Tim Cook is betting the magic is still there with the Vision Pro – and he’s making many of the same branding and messaging plays that proved so successful for his predecessor, even while the apps, as use cases that prove the technology, are still in their earliest stages of development. This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's Web3 Marketing Week. Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates. Apple Vision Pro is a headset, but you won’t find that word on the product’s landing page. Neither does Apple doesn’t overly concern itself with terms like augmented reality, extended reality, or mixed reality, even though those technologies are the essence of what the Vision Pro does. Instead, Apple chooses to tell you about how the Vision Pro enables you to enjoy immersive entertainment experiences from your sofa, capture and relive your precious moments as 3D photos and collaborate with remote colleagues as seamlessly as if you were in the same room. This is Apple’s secret sauce. It doesn’t tell us why we need the technology – it shows us why we want what it can do. This simple yet impactful communication strategy was instrumental in the widespread adoption of smartphones – and it already seems to be working for the Vision Pro. The device launched to U.S. consumers in February with an initial user base of up to 200,000 based on sales. If that seems underwhelming, then game engine giant Unity announced support for VisionOS from the moment of its release and there are further plans to roll out the device to the tech-hungry Chinese market later this year. Like spatial computing, Web3 is also an umbrella term, liberally thrown together with terms like blockchain, digital assets, DeFi and the rest of the crypto-jargon dictionary. But most people embedded in the crypto sphere have little grasp of how meaningless these words are to the lay person – and it’s not for a want of understanding their implications. Assuredly, the tech is appealing: a global survey carried out by Consensys found that 83% of respondents prioritize data privacy, 70% think they should share in the profits made from their data and 79% desire greater control over their online identities. Thus, the core values of Web3 are a vote-winner with the general public. Yet a disconnect remains: people support the ideology of Web3 without realizing what it is or how they can incorporate it into their lives. At the moment, the industry is an echo chamber with companies preaching to the converted using an esoteric lingua franca that resonates with a small audience of switched-on, tech-savvy users and crypto-native investors. To make good on the promise of Web3, there needs to be a shift towards more accessible, relatable messaging.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/web3-marketing-needs-apple-secret-142336677.html,AAPL,0.53

Apple slashes prices of iPhone 15 models to new low in China amid heated competition in world's largest smartphone market,20/5/2024 9:30,South China Morning Post20 May 2024 at 2:30 am·3-min read,"Apple is offering a new range of steep discounts for iPhone 15 models to consumers in mainland China, with online retail platforms bringing prices to a new low amid the US tech giant's efforts to boost sluggish sales in the world's biggest smartphone market. The top-of-the-line 256-gigabyte iPhone 15 Pro Max model, for example, on Monday started selling for 7,949 yuan (US$1,100) on Apple's official online stores on JD.com and Alibaba Group Holding's Tmall platform - down 2,050 yuan, or 20 per cent off, from its 9,999-yuan price tag when the new series was released last September. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post. The basic 128GB iPhone 15 model, meanwhile, now costs 23 per cent less at 4,599 yuan, down from its previous price of 5,999 yuan, on both JD.com and Tmall. The sale runs from May 20 to 28, according to the two platforms. Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

Apple's atypical iPhone discount drive on Chinese online marketplaces started in January, following online and offline campaigns of rival Chinese smartphone vendors - including Xiaomi and Honor - that knocked down prices on their various Android models. Discounts of up to 800 yuan were offered by Apple through its mainland online store in the same month, covering iPhones, iPads, MacBook laptops, AirPods and the Apple Watch.

Apple slashes iPhone prices in China amid fierce Huawei competition,20/5/2024 9:22,Reuters20 May 2024 at 2:22 am·1-min read,"BEIJING (Reuters) — Apple has launched an aggressive discounting campaign on its official Tmall site in China, offering discounts of up to 2,300 yuan ($318) on select iPhone models. The discounting comes as the U.S. tech giant seeks to defend its position in the high-end smartphone market, where it faces increasing competition from local rivals such as Huawei. Running from May 20 to May 28, it is more substantial than the one Apple offered in February. While the highest discount in the February campaign was 1,150 yuan, this time discounts are up to 2,300 yuan. The steepest discount applies to the 1TB iPhone 15 Pro Max model, while other models also see significant price cuts. For instance, the 128 GB version of the base iPhone 15 model has a discount of 1,400 yuan, according to Reuters' checks on Monday. The increased competitive pressure on Apple comes after Huawei last month introduced its new series of high-end smartphones, the Pura 70, following the launch of the Mate 60 last August. Apple's previous discounting effort in February appears to have helped the company mitigate a sales slowdown in China. Apple's shipments in China increased by 12% in March, according to Reuters' calculations based on data from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT). This marks a significant improvement from the first two months of 2024, when the company experienced a 37% slump in sales.

iPad Air M2 review: cheaper iPad Pro for rest of us gets bigger,20/5/2024 6:00,Samuel Gibbs Consumer technology editor19 May 2024 at 11:00 pm·5-min read,"Apple has more options than ever for those after a tablet with different sizes, prices, screens and power, but the iPad Air is fairly simple to understand – it is the premium big-screen iPad for those who don’t want to fork out thousands for an iPad Pro. The Air starts at £599 (€699/$599/A$999) and is now available in two screen sizes: the original 11in and a larger 13in model for big-screen viewing. That puts it right in the middle of Apple’s lineup, with the 10th-gen iPad starting at £349 at the bottom and topped by the new iPad Pro M4 starting at £999. The 11in Air is a straight replacement for the excellent M1 model from 2022, with the same good-looking iPad Pro-like design, the same crisp screen and stereo speakers. The 13in version, as reviewed here, is enlarged by a factor of 1.2 on the diagonal, making it about the same size as previous-generation iPad Pros. The Air’s screen is a significant upgrade on the base-model iPad, being brighter and of higher quality, matching good-quality laptop screens such as those on the MacBook Air or Surface Laptop. But it lacks the more advanced 120Hz miniLED or OLED technology from the iPad Pro line. That means it is not as bright, contrasty or smooth as Apple’s top tablets. Compared side by side, the difference is night and day, but so is the price. The stereo speakers are great for watching TV. The aluminium body and glass front feel solid and are only 1mm thicker than the super slender, 5.1mm thick iPad Pro. The webcam has been moved to the top edge in landscape, which makes for a much-improved video call experience over previous iPads.

The 'Magnificent 7' term needs to be retired after Q1 earnings: Goldman Sachs,18/5/2024 5:39,Investing.com17 May 2024 at 10:39 pm·1-min read,"Goldman Sachs has observed a significant shift among the top technology companies, often dubbed the ""Magnificent 7,"" following their first-quarter results. Collectively, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)., Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc., Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)., Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. saw their profits increase by 48% year-over-year. This growth was supported by a 14% increase in sales and a margin expansion of 521 basis points, bringing the aggregate margin to 22.8%. However, this overall performance conceals the varying fortunes of the individual companies, the analysis showed. Meta Platforms, Alphabet, and Amazon outperformed expectations with sales growth of 27%, 15%, and 13% respectively, leading to year-to-date share price increases of 34%, 25%, and 21%. These gains reflect a stronger market performance for these companies relative to some of their peers. In stark contrast, Apple's sales saw a 4% decline, while Tesla experienced a 9% drop in revenues. Consequently, their stock prices have been impacted, with Apple's shares dipping by 1% and Tesla's plummeting by 30%. This downturn has led to Tesla's ranking falling to the 12th largest stock in the S&P 500 index. ""The sobriquet “Magnificent 7” needs to be retired following 1Q results,"" Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note.

"Apple’s iPad Pro is its most incredible product, but software holds it back",17/5/2024 19:59,Daniel Howley·Technology EditorUpdated 17 May 2024 at 12:59 pm·4-min read,"Apple’s (AAPL) latest 13-inch iPad Pro is a marvel of engineering. But software still hamstrings the iPad Pro’s true potential, relegating the device to a sleek, high-end package for consuming content rather than allowing the iPad Pro to realize its productivity potential. The company has packed its latest M4 processor with up to 10 CPU and 10 GPU cores, more than you’ll find in its current MacBook Air and at least one version of its MacBook Pro, into a tablet thinner than Apple’s iPod Nano. At just 5.1 millimeters thick, the iPad Pro feels like if you hold it by one end, the other will droop like a piece of loose-leaf paper. It doesn’t, of course. The 11-inch iPad Pro is almost as thin at 5.3 mm. Oh, and then there’s the new Ultra Retina XDR display. Apple says the screen combines two OLED panels to boost its overall brightness while offering the same exceptional benefits you’d get out of a normal OLED display. That means inky blacks and brilliant colors. And all of that is going to cost you. A base 13-inch iPad Pro with Apple’s Magic Keyboard will set you back $1,648. That’s more than a high-end 13-inch MacBook Air and an entry-level MacBook Pro. I could deal with that price, though, if the iPad Pro didn’t have one big setback — iPadOS. Over the years, the iPad has made progress toward offering more Mac-like capabilities. You can run multiple apps at the same time, connect to an external display for a larger workspace, group apps together, and more.

The potential thinner version is likely to be priced higher than Apple's iPhone Pro Max, and is expected to be launched with the iPhone 17 in September 2025, the report said. The Cupertino, California-based company is still testing different designs for the device, code-named D23, that could have Apple's latest-generation processor, likely called A19, the report added. Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. The expected revamp underscores Apple's need to spruce up the iPhone, the company's most popular product, as it grapples with tough competition from Honor and Huawei in China and Samsung Electronics globally. Samsung had the largest share of the smartphone market in the first three months of 2024 with 20.8%, followed by Apple's 17.3% market share, according to research firm International Data Corporation. For the fiscal second quarter, Apple's iPhone sales fell 10.5% to $45.96 billion.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,17/5/2024 13:00,Zacks Equity Research17 May 2024 at 6:00 am·5-min read,"Apple (AAPL) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term. Over the past month, shares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned +13.7%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry, which Apple falls in, has gained 12.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction? Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision. Revisions to Earnings Estimates Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock. We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. Apple is expected to post earnings of $1.33 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.4%. The consensus earnings estimate of $6.57 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +7.2%. This estimate has changed +0.5% over the last 30 days. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.20 indicates a change of +9.6% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.4%. Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Apple is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-inc-aapl-attracting-investor-130016542.html,AAPL,0.57
Is Apple (AAPL) Stanley Druckenmiller’s Best AI Stock Pick?,17/5/2024 12:22,Fahad Saleem17 May 2024 at 5:22 am·4-min read,"Insider Monkey recently analyzed billionaire Druckenmiller's latest Q1'2024 portfolio to see which AI stocks the billionaire was buying. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is part of the 10 Best AI stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller. But the interesting question to answer is: Is Apple really the best AI pick of Druckenmiller? Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller surprised the market when he revealed a new take in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) in his first quarter holdings data. Duquesne Capital bought a $19.6 million stake in Nvidia in the March quarter. After dumping Apple shares in the early 2011, Stanley Druckenmiller never took interest in the stock which remained one of the favorites of hedge funds throughout these years. But his latest move indicates the value investor is expecting a new bull run in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) which is struggling to take off with its AI plans. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares are down about 1% year to date. All eyes are now on Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Worldwide Developers Conference as investors believe Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) will reveal some blockbuster AI plans in the event. The closet Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has come to any meaningful AI offering is its new plan to integrate ChatGPT in its iOS 18. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, a notable Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) bull, called the possible deal between Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and OpenAI a ""golden goose"" for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tim Cook. Ives reiterated a Buy rating on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock with a $250 price target. Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) list of risks is long. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has faced consecutive quarters of revenue declines as its iPhone business, Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) bread and butter so far, continues to face growth challenges amid rising competition in China and customers' lack of enthusiasm to buy new iPhones. Major stakeholders like Warren Buffett are also starting to cut their stakes in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). To turn things around when it comes to the stock price, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) recently announced a historic a $110 billion stock buyback program. But that didn’t move the needle much for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is trading at around 29 times earnings. Estimates suggest Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) expects to make $6.53 a share in FY2024 on about $385.8 billion in sales, while EPS in fiscal 2025 is expected to come in at $7.13. When compared to peers like Microsoft, which are growing at a much faster rate and have their AI roadmap all in place, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock looks overvalued according to many analysts. Unless Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) pulls a miracle or out-of-this-world innovation, iPhone demand isn’t expected to rebound anytime soon due to a plethora of competitors which are making cheaper but quality smartphones, and rising inflation which is hurting consumer buying power. KeyBanc Capital Markets recently said in a report that iPhone demand in April was also ""soft.""

"Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Apple, Eli Lilly and Crocs",17/5/2024 9:32,Zacks Equity Research17 May 2024 at 2:32 am·4-min read,"Chicago, IL – May 17, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Apple AAPL, Eli Lilly LLY and Crocs CROX. Earnings season continues to wind down, with the period reflecting positivity. We’ve heard from over 460 S&P 500 companies, with this week’s reporting docket primarily dominated by retail. Total earnings for the S&P 500 members that have reported Q1 results are up +4.8% from the same period last year on +4.1% higher revenues. The earnings growth pace reflects an acceleration relative to other periods, undoubtedly a positive development. Estimates for the coming 2024 Q2 cycle have been trending higher, reflecting optimism among analysts. So far, several companies, including Apple, Eli Lilly and Crocs, have seen post-earnings positivity. Let’s take a closer look at each. Apple Concerning headline figures, the company posted a 1.3% beat relative to the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate and posted sales 1% ahead of expectations. It reflected the company’s fifth consecutive double-beat, owing to its ability to positively surprise investors. Notably, the tech titan announced the biggest buyback in corporate history totaling $110 billion. Reflecting further positivity, Apple also unveiled a 4% boost to its quarterly payout, reflecting the 12th consecutive year of higher payouts. Earnings expectations have increased since the release, reflecting analysts’ optimistic view. The company’s growth profile remains positive, with current expectations alluding to a 7% pop in earnings on modestly higher sales in its current fiscal year (FY24). Peeking ahead to FY25, estimates allude to an additional 9.6% climb in earnings paired with a 5.5% sales bump.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-investment-ideas-feature-highlights-093200886.html,AAPL,0.63
"Some of the most talented, high-ranking workers at Apple, Microsoft, and SpaceX jumped ship after return-to-office mandates, new study reveals",16/5/2024 16:02,Jane Thier16 May 2024 at 9:02 am·7-min read,"The focus of return-to-office discussions have long focused on the individuals. Why might workers prefer to stay home? Which age groups are most amenable to in-person work, and which are most combative? Does office collaboration make the most sense for creative types or heads-down numbers people? Can workers really be productive left to their own devices? Yet the lingering question of how widespread remote work shapes company outcomes, as well as the wider sector landscape, largely remains unanswered because the whole experiment remains in flux. But a new working paper from researchers at the University of Michigan and University of Chicago, titled “Return to Office and the Tenure Distribution,” comes fairly close to positing an answer: Return-to-office (RTO) mandates, when they’re not wanted, are bad news for companies looking to keep their talent. The researchers matched 260 million resumes to company data to analyze causal effects of RTO mandates on employees’ tenure at Microsoft, SpaceX, and Apple. In scientific terms, they found “a reduction in counterfactual tenure that increases for employees with longer tenure.” In layman’s terms: When the firms enacted RTO mandates, senior employees headed for the door—often to direct competitors—who let them work from home. The number of top-brass employees at Microsoft—as a share of the company headcount—dropped by over 5% post-mandate; at Apple, it was 4%. (Microsoft mandated 50% of the week in-office; Apple, just one day a week.) SpaceX was the worst of the bunch, with a 15% drop, which the researchers chalk up to its uniquely stringent requirement: Five days a week in-person. That human outflow poses an enduring threat to “productivity, innovation, and competitiveness”—the component parts that separate a thriving company from one in freefall. Microsoft’s internal data doesn’t align with the paper’s findings, Amy Coleman, its vice president of human resources and corporate functions, told Fortune via email. The term “return to office mandate” is also inaccurate, she said, adding that Microsoft is a hybrid workplace “that revolves around flexibility and a mix of workstyles across worksite, work location and work hours.” In 2022, Microsoft’s chief human resources officer Kathleen Hogan told Fortune the company considers “working from home up to 50% of the time as standard.” Representatives for Apple and SpaceX did not respond to Fortune’s request for comment, though an Apple spokesperson told the Washington Post that the study drew “inaccurate conclusions” and “does not reflect the realities” of Apple’s business or attrition rates. The statistical analysis came from People Data Labs resumé data, David Van Dijcke, a coauthor and University of Michigan economics PhD student, tells Fortune. “The takeaway is definitely that the effects [of RTO mandates] are more deleterious than people thought before.” Granted, the study is far from all-encompassing; it only studied three major firms, and they were all “early movers” in the RTO push, Van Dijcke acknowledges, pointing to each of their 2022 mandate announcements. That meant senior employees who left Microsoft, Apple, and SpaceX had “pretty good outside options,” namely competing companies that offered remote work with far fewer strings attached. “If we think of Covid as ending in 2022, that was certainly followed by an influx of people claiming they would leave—and then really leaving when the first return-to-office mandates happened,” Anthony Nyberg, a management professor at the University of South Carolina’s Darla Moore School of Business, tells Fortune. “Apple and Microsoft really agonized over how to change their policies—Amazon, too, made many public comments.” To be sure, Nyberg went on, mandating an office return is a major strategic decision—and even in the Michigan study, which found a statistically significant portion of high-earning workers leaving, it remains unclear whether that’s necessarily a bad thing for their former companies. “A big part of this is likely to become a sorting effect in terms of talent finding their best-fit organizations,” Nyberg says. “And people going to competing companies has been a truism for all of eternity.”",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/most-talented-high-ranking-workers-160212454.html,AAPL,0.43

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stake and finally shed light on the mystery stock his firm, Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. (NYSE:BRK) (NYSE:BRK), accumulated ahead of the first quarter. Apple, Chevron Trimmed: Berkshire reduced its Apple position by a little over 116 million. The firm now owns 789,368,450 Apple shares valued at $135.36 billion, a 13F filing shows. This is the second straight quarter that the Buffett-led company has diluted its Apple stake. The iPhone manufacturer remains Berkshire’s top holding. Earlier this month, Buffett — at the annual Berkshire shareholder meeting — said the dilution has to do with footing the tax bill and the desire to hold more cash due to economic uncertainties. After adding 15.9 million Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX) shares in the fourth quarter, the firm sold 3.1 million shares of the oil giant in the first quarter. The latest 13F showed Berkshire owning 112.98 million shares worth $305.70 million.

Apple’s disastrous iPad ad mocked by rival Samsung in new 43-second spot: ‘We would never crush creativity’,16/5/2024 14:48,Christiaan Hetzner16 May 2024 at 7:48 am·2-min read,"Samsung gleefully joined this month’s Apple pile-on, unveiling a new ad for a Galaxy tablet that mocks its rival for a rare marketing misstep. The 43-second spot released on social media shows a young woman navigating through assorted debris strewn on the floor before stopping at a broken guitar she picks up. Studying sheet music displayed on her Galaxy Tab S9, she begins strumming a few chords, not caring that the damaged instrument is out of tune. “Creativity cannot be crushed,” ran the Samsung ad in a clear dig at its competitor in Cupertino still reeling from a badly conceived advertisement. We would never crush creativity. #UnCrush pic.twitter.com/qvlUqbRlnE — Samsung Mobile US (@SamsungMobileUS) May 15, 2024 In a world where machines could soon prove superior to their creators, Apple thought the best metaphor when selling its first new iPad Pro in nearly two years was a giant hydraulic press figuratively and literally crushing creative tools humanity has relied on for centuries into one ultra-thin Apple tablet—all to a cheerful Sonny and Cher melody. “Just think of all the things it’ll be used to create,” posted a giddy Tim Cook, only to be inundated with 19,000 replies of overwhelmingly angry consumers. People like actor Hugh Grant came away from viewing the ad disgusted at what was viewed as a vulgar and obscene display of Silicon Valley techno-fetishism personally endorsed by Steve Jobs' anointed successor as CEO, Tim Cook. “Steve wouldn’t have shipped that ad,” wrote Paul Graham, who founded startup accelerator Y Combinator. “It would have pained him too much to watch.”",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-disastrous-ipad-ad-mocked-144834332.html,AAPL,0.35
"Google, Apple, and Microsoft make their products friendlier to users with disabilities",16/5/2024 14:47,David Meyer16 May 2024 at 7:47 am·3-min read,"It’s Global Accessibility Awareness Day today, and Big Tech firms have accordingly issued a flurry of announcements about how they’ll make their products friendlier to people whose use of devices is hindered by disabilities. Most coverage of Google’s I/O developer event this week may have focused on its generative AI news, but the company also announced an expansion of Project Gameface to the Android platform. Google announced that project last year—it’s an open-source, hands-free gaming “mouse” that uses the webcam to capture the gamer’s head movements and facial gestures, translating them into cursor movements via the magic of machine learning. Now Google is open-sourcing more of the code so developers can make better Android accessibility apps. Gaming may have been the inspiration for Project Gameface—specifically, the needs of a gaming streamer named Lance Carr, who has muscular dystrophy—but the applications clearly go far beyond, with Google promising use cases in educational and work settings too. In a similar vein, Apple yesterday also announced an upcoming iPhone and iPad feature called Eye Tracking. This does what the name suggests, giving users a way to navigate through and activate the elements of an app, just by letting the front-facing camera track their eye movements. Apple also revealed other accessibility features that will be coming soon: Music Haptics, which will help deaf or hard-of-hearing iPhone users experience music with the aid of “taps, textures, and refined vibrations”; Vocal Shortcuts, which will let users trigger complex tasks by uttering simple sounds; and a bunch of new accessibility features specific to the CarPlay and visionOS environments. Meanwhile, on the intriguing-hardware front, we have Microsoft’s announcement yesterday of the Proteus controller for Xbox and PC gamers. Designed by peripherals startup ByoWave, the Proteus is a kit comprising “snap and play” parts that let people customize a wireless controller according to their needs. There’s a “mother cube” that serves as the controller’s brain, a cube features the directional pad, a piece with a mini control stick, another two providing left and right triggers, and so on. There are many possible configurations, from traditional controller layouts to wand-like columns and tabletop-friendly rectangles. Preorders are open now, with the kit ($255 to first-comers, $299 thereafter) shipping in the fall. Microsoft also used the occasion of Global Accessibility Awareness Day to promise fixes for what some gamers with disabilities experienced from a major change that the company made last November when it started blocking the use of unauthorized accessories with the Xbox console. This has been an issue for those who had put together custom controller setups to fit their unique requirements, with equipment coming from small specialist manufacturers that aren’t official Microsoft licensees. Part of Microsoft’s solution is for those manufacturers to get in touch and make their controllers official, but the company is also updating its own Adaptive Controller, which the Xbox always accepts, to expand support for more accessories. The $99 Adaptive Controller is a clever piece of gear that includes some built-in controller functionality of its own, but more importantly acts as a hub for specialized equipment, such as switches that are controlled by biting, sipping, and puffing with the mouth, or with one's feet. “We appreciate and acknowledge that gaming with a disability is highly individualistic, and the solution for one may not be the solution for all,” the company said.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/google-apple-microsoft-products-friendlier-144738151.html,AAPL,0.62
Warren Buffett’s Top Favorite Stocks for 2024,16/5/2024 12:55,Fahad Saleem16 May 2024 at 5:55 am·7-min read,"Warren Buffett's Q1'2024 stock holdings data is out and the market is inundated with excitement around the Oracle of Omaha's favorite stock picks. But unlike many other hedge funds which are fickle and revisit their investments regularly, Buffett believes in buying stocks and then holding on to them for decades. But over the past several months the market remained guessing the name of the ""mystery stock"" in Warren Buffett's portfolio he hadn’t revealed. Berkshire had requested SEC for confidentiality as it was busy buying large stakes in the company. Some said it would be Alphabet, some speculated it would be a Chinese stock (Alibaba was the favorite candidate). But many wise investors said the would be from the insurance and finance industry as Buffett has time and again indicated his preference for companies that are doing what he knows the best: insurance, banks, finance. Finally, Berkshire has revealed this mystery stock pick and it's part of our detailed list of Top 7 Favorite Stocks of Warren Buffett for 2024. At the latest annual meeting of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett revealed that is firm's cash piles had swelled to about $189 billion at the end of the first quarter, with him expecting the kitty to hit $200 billion by the end of the second quarter of 2024. This begs the question: why isn’t Buffett deploying this cash? After all he was the one who once said: “Today people who hold cash equivalents feel comfortable. They shouldn't. They have opted for a terrible long-term asset, one that pays virtually nothing and is certain to depreciate in value."" Buffett's reasoning is simple: he only invests when he finds attractive deals with ""eye-popping"" returns, and the market today just isn’t presenting him with any worthy opportunities. In his 2023 investor letter, Buffett went as far as to say that he sees ""no possibility of eye-popping performance"" in the current environment. Buffett always sticks to his core investing principle: never invest in overvalued equities. In his latest investor letter he reiterated that for him to invest in companies, they have to be ""attractively priced."" The Size Factor Another reason Berkshire isn’t deploying cash is its size and Buffett's inclination towards investing only for significant gains. ""Those days are long behind us; size did us in, though increased competition for purchases was also a factor. Berkshire now has – by far – the largest GAAP net worth recorded by any American business.""",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-top-favorite-stocks-125516289.html,AAPL,0.7

Note: The following is an excerpt from this week’s Earnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>> Here are the key points: What we saw in the Q1 earnings season is a resilient and steadily improving profitability picture, both in terms of the growth rate as well as the evolving revisions trend. Positive revenue surprises were a bit less commonplace relative to other recent periods, but margins expanded at a better-than-expected rate. Total earnings for the 461 S&P 500 members that have reported Q1 results are up +4.8% from the same period last year on +4.1% higher revenues, with 77.4% beating EPS estimates and 59.7% beating revenue estimates. The earnings and revenue growth pace for these 461 index members represents a modest acceleration from what we had seen in other recent periods. The +4.8% Q1 earnings growth pace improves to +11.4% once the Energy sector and Bristol Myers’s one-time charge are accounted for. For 2024 Q2, S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +9.1% from the same period last year on +4.5% higher revenues. Estimates have been increasing since the start of April, with the current +9.1% earnings growth pace up from +8.7% on April 3rd. In recent weeks, we have consistently flagged signs of improvement in the overall revisions trend, with estimates starting to go modestly up. We are seeing this trend for the current period (2024 Q2) as well as for full-year 2024 estimates. We started seeing this favorable turn in the revisions trend roughly around when the Q1 earnings reports started coming out. That said, several sectors, including Tech and Retail, had already been enjoying positive estimate revisions for quite some time. At present, half of the 16 Zacks sectors have higher aggregate earnings estimates than expected at the start of the year. We have recently highlighted the favorable revisions trend for the Energy sector in this space.

D.C. is testing its Big Tech antitrust campaign far from D.C.,16/5/2024 8:00,Alexis Keenan·Reporter16 May 2024 at 1:00 am·6-min read,"The Biden administration is testing its antitrust push far from Washington as it seeks to unwind the dominance of Big Tech. No longer is the nation’s capital the go-to trial venue of choice for the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission as they file competition challenges against the biggest names in Silicon Valley. Instead, it’s New Jersey where the government chose to sue Apple (AAPL). Or California, where it challenged Microsoft (MSFT). Or the state of Washington, where it confronted Amazon (AMZN). Or Virginia, where it filed a second antitrust suit against Google (GOOG, GOOGL). ""They’re clearly filing these tech cases in different jurisdictions where the law is less developed,"" said Douglas Ross, a professor of antitrust at the University of Washington School of Law. ""And they're doing it for a reason."" A variety of strategies could explain the multi-jurisdictional approach, according to antitrust lawyers. Prosecutors could be targeting appeals courts with case law more favorable to their legal theories, since all of the district courts selected by Biden’s FTC and DOJ report to different courts of appeals. The government could also be weighing the speed of a court in handling litigation and the convenience to anticipated witnesses, said Juan Arteaga, a partner with Crowell & Moring’s antitrust litigation division. It’s also possible, he added, that government officials may want to showcase vigorous anticompetitive enforcement to the rest of the country. ""I think the current leadership team and the DOJ antitrust division have really made it a point to try to take antitrust enforcement out of the D.C. bubble,"" Arteaga said. Ross is more skeptical of a strategy that seeks out jurisdictions where judges have less antitrust experience and fewer controlling antitrust cases are on the books.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/dc-is-testing-its-big-tech-antitrust-campaign-far-from-dc-080007707.html,AAPL,0.25
"Hedge fund Coatue scraps its Apple stake in Q1, while Viking built its position",15/5/2024 23:26,Carolina Mandl15 May 2024 at 4:26 pm·2-min read,"By Carolina Mandl NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hedge fund Coatue Management dissolved its stake in Apple Inc in the first quarter while Viking Global Investors built a sizeable new position, securities filings showed on Wednesday. Coatue, founded by Philippe Laffont, had 2.4 million shares of Apple in December, worth $470.6 million. Regulatory filings showed it had dissolved that stake entirely by the end of March. Apple's shares plunged almost 11% in the first quarter as the company faced fiercer competition in China and falling revenues. Shares in the iPhone maker have pared losses in the second quarter and are now down 1.5% year to date. Other big investors have cut their stakes in Apple. Earlier this month, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway said it had trimmed its position by 13%. Still, Buffett praised the company during Berkshire's annual meeting, saying the iPhone was ""one of the greatest products."" Coatue's filing also showed it reduced its stake in chipmaking giant Nvidia by roughly 68% to 1.4 million shares, or $1.2 billion. Year to date, shares in Nvidia are up 91%. Coatue also trimmed its position in electric vehicle maker Tesla by 37% to 2.6 million shares. The company's shares are down almost 30% this year amid fierce competition and slowing sales. Coatue, however, more than doubled its holdings in Google-parent Alphabet, to 5.7 million shares. Conversely, Viking showed in the filing a new $663.8 million stake in Apple and a similar position in Microsoft. The funds' positions were revealed in quarterly securities fillings known as 13Fs. While backward looking, these snapshots show what funds owned on the last day of the quarter and are one of the few ways hedge funds and other institutional investors have to declare their positions. The filings do not indicate exact timing of purchases or sales and may not reflect current holdings. Both Coatue and Viking are so-called Tiger cubs, hedge funds seeded by veteran investor Julian Robertson, founder of Tiger Management.

Google is reinventing itself for the AI age,15/5/2024 17:54,Daniel Howley·Technology Editor15 May 2024 at 10:54 am·4-min read,"MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. — Google (GOOG, GOOGL) is in the midst of a full-blown AI evolution. On Tuesday, the company announced a flurry of AI products and services during its I/O developer conference with the aim of repositioning itself as the world’s AI software leader. “We are fully in our Gemini era,” CEO Sundar Pichai said during his keynote, referring to the company’s latest Gemini AI models, while noting that AI is still “in the very early days of the AI platform shift.” For years, Google was considered Silicon Valley’s AI powerhouse. But OpenAI and Microsoft (MSFT) threw the company off course, entering into a multibillion-dollar, multiyear partnership in 2023 that saw Microsoft integrate OpenAI’s most advanced models into its productivity, search, and cloud products. All this helped crown Microsoft as the world’s most valuable company earlier this year. Google’s climb back hasn’t been easy. It originally debuted a ChatGPT competitor called Bard that fell short of initial expectations. And more recently, it bungled the rollout of its generative AI-powered image generator, a tool that the company admitted was not “working the way we intended.” Stealing back the AI throne starts with Google reinventing its most important product: Search. Now — or soon, as it’s rolling out over time — at the top of the screen, you’ll find a generative AI-powered area called AI Overview that offers summarized responses to queries along with links to the sources. It’s a major departure for Google and could impact everything from the company’s advertisers, its main source of revenue, to websites that rely on the firm for search traffic, such as travel platforms and media organizations. While the Search changes are easily the biggest updates to Google’s public-facing products, they weren’t the only consequential announcements at the show. Google also showed off a new AI-powered prototype assistant called Project Astra. During a pre-recorded stage demo, the platform, which views content streamed through your smartphone camera, was able to identify objects, solve programming problems, and more. Unlike digital assistants Google Assistant and Apple’s (AAPL) Siri, Project Astra offers a more creative, conversational tone that sounds more human-like.

Forget iPhone: 4 Reasons to Bet on Apple ETFs,15/5/2024 17:00,Sanghamitra Saha15 May 2024 at 10:00 am·3-min read,"Apple Inc. AAPL has been an underperformer this year with a flat performance, falling short of other mega-cap technology companies. Investors should note that Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF MAGS has jumped 23.6% this year while Apple is up 0.9%. Apple's lesser exposure to AI within the “Magnificent Seven” group and concerns over the sales growth of iPhone in the key China market are being held responsible for this lackluster performance. Apple, in fact, faced a huge setback in China's smartphone market during the first quarter of the year, experiencing a 19% decline in shipments, its worst performance since 2020, per Reuters. This decline was due to the direct impact of Huawei's new product launches in the premium segment. Apple's share in China's smartphone market plunged to 15.7% from 19.7% a year earlier, placing it almost neck-and-neck with Huawei, which saw a remarkable 70% increase in sales. As a result, Apple lost its position as the top smartphone seller in China and slipped to the third place. Should we look beyond this weakness and dig deeper into other areas of strength? Apple recently unveiled its latest iPad Pros featuring the all-new M4 processor, which promises enhanced performance across various aspects, including AI capabilities. Apple directly challenged competitors like Intel, AMD and Qualcomm by asserting that the M4's neural engine surpasses any other neural processing unit in AI PCs. This move indicates Apple's ambition to lead in AI technology, particularly in the realm of consumer devices. Apple’s heavy investment in AI and CEO Tim Cook's increasing mentions of it indicate a strategic focus on the development of the technology. This includes acquiring smaller AI firms and exploring partnerships with industry leaders like OpenAI and Google. Analysts anticipate that Apple's advancements in generative AI will drive iPhone sales by introducing compelling new features. As consumers hold onto their devices for longer periods, innovative AI experiences could serve as a significant differentiator between iPhone generations. Moreover, Apple's overall quarterly revenues fell in Q2, but less than what analysts had expected, and Tim Cook expects revenue growth to resume in the current quarter. In the last reported quarter, sales in Greater China, Apple's third-largest region, fell by 8% to $16.37 billion. The figure surpassed FactSet analysts’ anticipated sales of $15.25 billion.

Apple brings eye tracking to iPhone and iPad in accessibility update,15/5/2024 16:45,"Martyn Landi, PA Technology Correspondent15 May 2024 at 9:45 am·2-min read","Apple is to enable eye tracking on the iPhone and iPad as part of a new range of accessibility tools aimed at helping those with physical disabilities to more easily use their devices. Using artificial intelligence, it will allow users to navigate their Apple device using just their eyes. The new feature is joined by a new Music Haptics tool, which uses the taptic engine in the iPhone – which powers the vibrations on the device – to enable those who are deaf or hard of hearing to experience music vibrating to the audio of the music. Apple said it was also introducing new speech features which enable users to assign custom utterances to virtual assistant Siri to help with shortcuts to apps, aimed at those with conditions that affect their speech. The eye-tracking tool uses the front-facing camera on the iPhone or iPad to set up and calibrate, and does not require any additional hardware or software. The AI processing to enable eye tracking also takes place on-device, Apple said. “We believe deeply in the transformative power of innovation to enrich lives,” Apple chief executive Tim Cook said. “That’s why for nearly 40 years, Apple has championed inclusive design by embedding accessibility at the core of our hardware and software. “We’re continuously pushing the boundaries of technology, and these new features reflect our long-standing commitment to delivering the best possible experience to all of our users.” Also among the suite of new features announced by the tech giant was a feature the firm says could reduce motion sickness for passengers in moving vehicles.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-brings-eye-tracking-iphone-164515629.html,AAPL,0.75
India's Redington posts 5% rise in quarterly profit on gadgets demand,15/5/2024 15:07,Reuters15 May 2024 at 8:07 am·1-min read,"BENGALURU, May 15 (Reuters) - Indian IT products distributor Redington reported a 5% rise in quarterly profit on Wednesday, aided by demand for mobile phones and computers in its key markets. The Apple and Samsung gadgets distributor's consolidated net profit climbed to 3.26 billion rupees ($39.06 million) for the fourth quarter ended March 31, according to a regulatory filing. Affluent Indians are increasingly spending more than 30,000 rupees ($361.30) on new smartphones, benefiting manufacturers and distributors such as Redington. Global personal computer sales also show signs of recovery after inflation-hit customers delayed system upgrades for several quarters. Revenue from operations for Redington rose nearly 3% to 224.33 billion rupees, benefiting from an 8% growth in its SISA segment, which includes Singapore, India and South Asia. Revenue from its consumer and commercial personal computers, print and supplies business in SISA rose 10% in the quarter, while its smartphones and feature phones business in the region recorded a 6% growth. The growth in SISA made up a 2% decline in revenue from the rest of the world for the company, which has a presence in 31 countries, including Rwanda, Oman and Turkey.

iPad Pro M4 review: ludicrously good hardware that’s total overkill for most,15/5/2024 6:00,Samuel Gibbs Consumer technology editor14 May 2024 at 11:00 pm·7-min read,"Apple’s latest iPad Pro is thinner and lighter, and has a stupendous new OLED screen, plus oodles of power to do practically anything. But it is no longer just the super-premium iPad – it is also aiming to be an impressive tool for the creative industry. It still looks and acts like an iPad, ready to do regular iPad things such as browse the web, watch TV or chat to your family on the other side of the country. But to do only that with a machine this advanced is total overkill – Apple has many other iPad models suited to that sort of thing. This serious tablet comes with a serious price tag. The smaller 11in version starts at £999 (€1,119/$999/A$1,699), while the 13in model costs from £1,299 (€1,549/$1,299/A$2,199). That’s already laptop money without including accessories such as a keyboard or stylus. Unlike previous generations of the iPad Pro, the 11in and 13in have the same new screen technology, making the smaller model as reviewed more tempting. It essentially has two OLED screens layered on top of each other to produce an extremely high full-screen brightness of up to 1,000nits, and a peak of 1,600nits in super-bright spots in HDR content. For reference, other iPads top out at 600nits, while many competitor tablets, laptops or monitors barely reach 400nits. It runs at up to 120Hz, making it super-smooth in operation, and has incredible contrast similar to high-end OLED displays on phones or TVs. Blacks are truly black, whites are super-bright, and it is spectacularly colourful and accurate. It surpasses the already excellent previous generation, and will be the best screen in almost everyone’s house. For those likely to need absolute colour accuracy, such as those in the film industry, Apple also offers a special reference mode in settings, and sells an antiglare nano texture screen coating, similar to its professional monitors. The tablet is extremely thin at 5.3mm thick or less, and is now lighter by up to 103g depending on the model. You will need a case to keep it safe, and you will need to be more careful with it than you might a cheaper, bulkier tablet. The Face ID selfie camera is now in the right place for video calls in landscape, which is much better.

Huawei flagship store surge in China signals showdown with Apple,15/5/2024 1:02,Josh Ye14 May 2024 at 6:02 pm·4-min read,"By Josh Ye HONG KONG (Reuters) - Huawei is revamping its retail strategy and aggressively opening flagship stores in China, with some just a stone's throw away from Apple shops, as it seeks to retake the premium electronics throne in the world's biggest smartphone market. Situated directly across from Apple's Shanghai flagship store, Huawei's recently renovated shop spans three floors of a famous heritage architecture building in the financial hub's busy shopping district and includes a coffee shop and a gym. Huawei opened four such stores in major Chinese cities between December and February, an aggressive marketing blitz by a company that had largely relied on licensed distributors and is rebounding from U.S. sanctions imposed in 2019 that had crippled its smartphone business for four years until it could source domestic replacement parts. ""The Huawei flagship store is very nice.

Then it will eventually catch up to Apple,"" said Ethan Qi, associate director at research firm Counterpoint. It marks a stark contrast to 2021 when the company's licensed stores were shuttered across China due to product shortages caused by the U.S. sanctions. Huawei has since developed its own chips, introduced highly popular 5G-capable products and, according to sources, has started aggressively recruiting dealers in recent months.

OpenAI’s new GPT-4o model offers promise of improved smartphone assistants,14/5/2024 18:00,Alex Hern UK technology editor14 May 2024 at 11:00 am·3-min read,"In the year and a half since the launch of ChatGPT, one nagging question has only got more pressing: if AI can do this, why is my phone’s assistant still so bad? On Monday, the gulf grew larger still, as OpenAI announced a new model called GPT-4o – the ‘o’ stands for Omni – which gives the chatbot new abilities to understand and create audio, video, and still images. The system is uncanny to behold. It can engage in prolonged conversations about the world seen through a camera lens, carry out live translation between two different languages, and even laugh at appropriate points. The shine will inevitably wear off after users find the shortcomings in the system, but its creators are more confident than ever. When GPT-4 was launched in 2023, the OpenAI founder, Sam Altman, tweeted that the AI “is still flawed, still limited, and it still seems more impressive on first use than it does after you spend more time with it”. A year on, there was no such doubt with the launch of its successor: as well as a longer statement about an “an exciting future where we are able to use computers to do much more than ever before”, Altman tweeted a single word: “her”, the name of the 2013 Spike Jonze film depicting a man slowly falling in love with his AI assistant. GPT-4o is closer than ever to that science fiction scenario. Previous versions of the AI have been able to talk to the user, but only through a laborious process of transcribing speech to text, running it through the normal ChatGPT system, then generating human-sounding speech in reply. By contrast, the new system can operate directly in speech without needing to lean on other models to prop it up, speeding up responses and allowing it to acknowledge quirks such as tone of voice. But it still isn’t quite an AI assistant. It can answer questions and perform knowledge work, but not – yet – act on requests. The GPT Store, a repository of third-party integrations collated by OpenAI, could help, but to really embed itself in normal people’s lives, GPT needs the power of Siri. And it seems Apple agrees. The iPhone maker has reportedly been in talks since March with AI developers, including Google and OpenAI, over licensing their technology to improve its own AI assistant. Over the weekend it reportedly “neared” a deal with the latter. According to Bloomberg, which broke the news, the deal would allow Apple to offer ChatGPT alongside the other AI features it will announce at its annual Worldwide Developers conference in June. The link-up would probably fall short of fully replacing Siri with ChatGPT. That is partly because Apple is wary of embedding another company’s technology too deeply in its own devices – the scars from the painful replacement of Google Maps with Apple Maps over a decade ago still smart – but also because even the best AI systems aren’t quite ready for the sort of demands an assistant requires.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/openai-gpt-4o-model-offers-180000533.html,AAPL,0.67
"Google debuts a slew of generative AI features as fight with rivals OpenAI, Microsoft, and Apple heats up",14/5/2024 17:56,Daniel Howley·Technology Editor14 May 2024 at 10:56 am·4-min read,"Google (GOOG, GOOGL) unveiled a slew of generative AI products at its Google I/O developer conference on Tuesday, including its Gemini Live assistant, updates for its Android and Workspaces platforms, and an overhaul of its flagship Search product. The announcements are part of Google’s broader effort to reestablish itself as Silicon Valley’s AI leader after it was caught off guard by Microsoft’s (MSFT) partnership with OpenAI in 2022. The new products also come a day after OpenAI unveiled its GPT-4o AI model and days before rivals Microsoft and Apple (AAPL) debut their own major generative AI updates. The biggest announcement is that Google is updating its Search platform to include generative AI results at the top of the screen. The feature, which was originally available as part of a preview in the company's Search Labs, is now coming to all US users and rolling out globally in the coming future. Another one of the biggest announcements was a new, personalized AI assistant called Gemini Live. The feature, powered by the company’s Gemini 1.5 Pro model, will allow you to speak directly to the assistant on your mobile device, providing you with responses in a number of natural-sounding voices. On the Android front, Google says it's expanding the assistant to interact with apps like Google Messages and Gmail, allowing users, for example, to drag and drop generated images from Gemini into texts and emails. Users can also use the app to ask specific questions about YouTube videos, and it will scour the video's captions to find an answer. Google is also updating its on-device version of Gemini, called Gemini Nano, with new multimodal features. Multimodal means that a generative AI model can work across mediums including text, images, and video. Google’s vice president of engineering for Gemini experiences, Amar Subramanya, told Yahoo Finance he’s been using Gemini Live for brainstorming, bouncing ideas off of the assistant. Subramanya said early testers have also been using Gemini Live for scenarios including translation. In the coming months, Google says Gemini Live will be able to access a user's cameras, allowing the assistant to interact with the real world and things it sees. OpenAI has also shown off these capabilities in demos of its GPT-4o. In one example, Subramanya said he asked the assistant to find a recipe for a pineapple upside-down cake for 15 people and add the ingredients to his Keep shopping list. The assistant found a recipe for eight people, scaled the proportions from eight to 15 people, and put the items Subramanya needed to put it together into his shopping list.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/google-debuts-a-slew-of-generative-ai-features-as-fight-with-rivals-openai-microsoft-and-apple-heats-up-175635303.html,AAPL,0.6
4 Best ETF Areas of Last Week,14/5/2024 17:00,Sanghamitra Saha14 May 2024 at 10:00 am·3-min read,"Wall Street was upbeat last week with the S&P 500 adding 1.9%, the Dow Jones advancing 2.2% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.1%. Most importantly, the Dow Jones just had its best week of 2024. On Friday, the Dow secured its eighth consecutive session of gains. While most of the 30 members of the Dow Jones Index have performed well over the last seven days, the Dow rally was mainly driven by Amgen AMGN, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, Apple Inc. (AAPL), Boeing BA and The Goldman Sachs Group GS. As far as the company-specific news are concerned, Apple drew attention. The company unveiled a new lineup of iPads for the first time in two years. The tech giant launched two new versions of its top-end iPad Pro models and two new versions of its mid-tier iPad Air. It also debuted the Apple Pencil Pro stylus and an updated Magic Keyboard case for the iPad Pro line. Among US economic data points, we received a downbeat consumer sentiment data. Sentiment dropped to a six-month low. The University of Michigan Survey of Consumers sentiment index for May posted an initial reading of 67.4 for the month, down from 77.2 in April and well below the Dow Jones consensus call for 76. Fed officials reaffirmed the stance for higher rates for a longer period. Policymaker Neel Kashkari signaled that rates are likely to stay at historic highs for a while. Boston Fed President Susan Collins further supported this notion, saying it will take longer ""than previously thought"" to bring inflation down (read: ETFs to Bet on Dow Jones' Longest Winning Streak of 2024). Meanwhile, U.S. companies are having their best earnings season in nearly two years. With 80% of the companies in the S&P 500 having already reported, the index is on track to record 5% growth in first-quarter earnings per share per FactSet, as quoted on Yahoo Finance.

OpenAI’s leap forward in human-like AI assistants underscores Apple’s growing peril,14/5/2024 15:02,David Meyer14 May 2024 at 8:02 am·4-min read,"Sam Altman promised ahead of OpenAI’s big announcement yesterday that the company would be revealing something that “feels like magic to me.” While I can’t speak for Altman in terms of what he perceives as magical, the new GPT-4o model certainly is impressive. I’ll leave it to my AI-specialist colleagues to analyze what’s going on under the hood, but for the general public, GPT-4o seems set to be the first model that really comes across like a human in out-loud conversation. The persona OpenAI showed off in its demos was perhaps cloyingly over-familiar—creepy, even—but it’s a darn good simulacrum of a person, partly because it can handle text, vision, and audio all at once and at speed. This is where virtual assistants get real—or at least realistic enough to start being justifiably lumped in with the likes of Samantha, the assistant voiced by Scarlett Johansson in Spike Jonze’s 2013 film Her. Altman himself made the comparison in an X post after the announcement. Sure, Samantha may have [SPOILER ALERT] abandoned the film’s lovelorn protagonist at the end of that story, but who cares? This is about the technical achievement, right? Only it isn’t. We have now crossed into the territory of potential seduction, and I don’t mean that in a romantic sense. A realistic text conversation with an AI is impressive and in some cases useful, but a realistic voice, paired with the ability to perceive the user’s appearance and environment, is something else. This is technology that will be able to convincingly influence and cajole the user, and its arrival means we will have to pay very close attention to the compulsions of the entity behind the voice. As I have previously written, I would very much like to see virtual assistants that really work for us—reliable and discreet agents that can do stuff on our behalf, acting only in our interests. They would ideally be open-source, so we could verify their security and privacy promises, but they would also need to be on-device assistants that do not need the cloud to function. Let’s see what Google announces later today at its I/O developer conference—an AI-powered mobile assistant called Pixie is rumored to be on the list—but, as things stand, the most likely company to realize the sort of assistant I’ve been dreaming of is Apple. At next month’s WWDC developer event, Apple will be showing off its own AI advances, which according to the New York Times will include an “improved Siri [that Apple will pitch as being] more private than rival A.I. services because it will process requests on iPhones rather than remotely in data centers.” That sounds like a lot of what I’ve been waiting for, minus the open-source part. However, it remains to be seen to what degree, and in what way, Apple will meet the moment. Apple is behind in the AI game, to the extent that its desire to catch up reportedly played a big role in its decision to abandon its self-driving car efforts. Making Siri smarter will, given Siri’s current dumb-as-a-rock-ness, not be overly difficult. But Apple’s new assistant won’t just have to excel within the paradigm of Apple’s existing offerings—it will need to provide an impressive alternative to the latest and greatest virtual assistants, and OpenAI just set the bar very high indeed. Now, Apple is reportedly in intense talks to have OpenAI’s technology power some of the iPhone’s incoming chatbot features. (Google’s Gemini is apparently still another option.) If these talks bear fruit, it’s as yet unclear whether we’ll be looking at Siri plus another chatbot, or a Siri that uses Apple’s on-device model to deal with certain private stuff, and an external model to handle other tasks—I’m really not sure how that would work.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/openai-leap-forward-human-ai-150259365.html,AAPL,0.57

Comcast (CMCSA) CEO Brian Roberts said early Tuesday that later this month, the company will launch a new offering that combines its Peacock platform, Netflix (NFLX), and Apple TV+ (AAPL). The new bundle, referred to as StreamSaver, will be available to customers of Comcast’s broadband internet service, the executive revealed at a MoffettNathanson conference. ""Those three products will come at a vastly reduced price to anything in the market today and be available to all our customers,"" Roberts said. Exact pricing details will be announced at a later date. ""We've been bundling video successfully and creatively for 60 years,"" he added. ""This is the latest iteration of that, and I think this will be a pretty compelling package."" The developments come as media companies face pressure from investors to scale their streaming services and achieve profitability. At the same time, the companies are dealing with more competition from tech giants like Amazon (AMZN) and YouTube (GOOGL, GOOG), which are gobbling up streaming deals. On average, US consumers subscribe to four streaming services and spend about $61 per month on them, according to the latest Digital Media Trends report from Deloitte. That means fewer opportunities for streamers to retain loyal subscribers over time. The concept of bundling isn't new. Companies in the space have been doing it with their own services for years. Apple, for instance, offers Apple One, which combines Apple TV+ with other services like Apple Music and Apple Arcade. The bundle launched globally in late 2020. Disney, which has also been offering a bundle with Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+, officially began its domestic rollout of a one-app experience late last year that incorporates Hulu content via Disney+ — a similar play to Paramount's Showtime combination as well as the integration of HBO Max and Discovery+, which both merged their respective services last year. The move toward partnerships among competing media companies, though, has gained traction recently. Just last week, Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) and Disney (DIS) announced a new streaming bundle that will bring together Disney+, Hulu, and Max streaming services, with a launch date set for this summer in the US.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/another-streaming-bundle-comcasts-peacock-to-partner-with-netflix-apple-tv-141828658.html,AAPL,0.55

For decades, Western companies made a fortune betting on the inexorable rise of the Chinese consumer. Now an economic slump and the emergence of ferocious local competitors means those bets look less safe as price wars erupt. Discounts and special deals are being offered across consumer brands from food and clothing to consumer electronics and cars, reflecting a dramatic shift in consumption patterns in the world’s second largest economy. One of the most intense price wars is raging in the electric vehicle (EV) industry, where a “life and death” race has manufacturers scrambling for survival. Tesla’s China market share shrank to 4% in April, almost halving from 7.7% in March, according to data released by the China Passenger Car Association on Friday. Deliveries from its Shanghai factory, its largest globally, fell 18% last month from a year earlier. The sharp drop contrasts with rising sales by its biggest Chinese rival BYD, which reported a 29% jump in pure EV deliveries. “Everyone has changed the way they think about China,” said Anne Stevenson-Yang, co-founder and managing principal at J Capital Research. “The business climate has changed entirely.” Last month, Tesla (TSLA) announced aggressive price cuts in the country, shortly after also reducing prices in the United States and Germany. The move added to a series of price reductions that it has made in its biggest overseas market since late 2022. Last year, the Chinese economy grew 5.2%. Outside the pandemic years, that was its slowest pace of annual expansion since 1990, when gross domestic product increased only 3.9% because of international sanctions following the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.

Analysts at the investment bank RBC Capital Markets raised their target price on Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock from $450 to $500 on Friday, citing positive feedback from their recent investor meetings with Microsoft's Directors of Investor Relations. RBC stressed that AI remains a key growth driver for Microsoft, highlighting that the tech giant continues to make substantial investments in this rapidly developing sector. “While CapEx will likely continue to ramp and impact margins, Microsoft is following demand signals and is simultaneously focused on bringing the cost curve down,” analysts said in the note. “Advances like GPT-4o, which is more efficient, and Maia (custom AI silicon) will help drive down the cost curve,” they added. RBC also emphasized Microsoft's expertise in cloud services as a major advantage, providing a unified architecture for all AI workloads. Moreover, RBC noted that while Microsoft's core cloud business is still in its early stages, there is a clear trend of companies moving more workloads to the cloud. Azure's growth, excluding AI, has accelerated in the fiscal Q2, they noted. “Importantly, core Azure is benefiting from the broader AI roadmap, as one-third of the 50K+ Azure AI customers are net new to Azure,” analysts noted.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/5-big-analyst-ai-moves-033937607.html,AMD,0.7
What's Going On With AMD Stock Friday?,17/5/2024 16:54,Anusuya Lahiri17 May 2024 at 9:54 am·2-min read,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) stock is trading higher Friday amid reports that Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is eying the former’s artificial intelligence chips for its cloud computing customers. Azure’s cloud service could integrate AMD’s MI300X AI chips to beat Nvidia Corp’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) H100 GPU supply crisis. Recent reports indicated that AMD is winning market share in the x86 processor market for client and server categories despite rivalry from Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC). AMD grabbed Wall Street’s attention for its considerable gains in the server CPU market and the merchant accelerator sector with the Mi300 series, positioning it as a formidable competitor to Nvidia in the merchant accelerators market. Wall Street analysts highlighted a long-term upside of over $10 billion in revenue synergies from the Xilinx acquisition. Meanwhile, AMD is gearing up to meet the increasing demand for AI computing by leveraging its broad product lineup. CTO Mark Papermaster recently pointed to AMD’s robust suite of compute engines, deep customer relationships across various markets, and open software capabilities. Papermaster revealed that AMD would make significant announcements at Computex. He also shared that AMD’s R&D investment has almost quadrupled, from $1.5 billion in 2019 to $5.9 billion in 2023, to meet escalating performance and efficiency demands.

"Investors Heavily Search Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD): Here is What You Need to Know",17/5/2024 13:00,Zacks Equity Research17 May 2024 at 6:00 am·5-min read,"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock. Shares of this chipmaker have returned +4.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5% change. The Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, to which Advanced Micro belongs, has gained 4.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term? While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making. Earnings Estimate Revisions Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock. We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. For the current quarter, Advanced Micro is expected to post earnings of $0.67 per share, indicating a change of +15.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.4% over the last 30 days. The consensus earnings estimate of $3.42 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +29.1%. This estimate has changed -0.3% over the last 30 days. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.18 indicates a change of +51.3% from what Advanced Micro is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.5%. With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Advanced Micro.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-advanced-micro-130014956.html,AMD,0.35

Here's why investors seem to be hesitant to own AMD stock: Mizuho,17/5/2024 10:18,Investing.com17 May 2024 at 3:18 am·2-min read,"Investors are growing increasingly skeptical about owning AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) stock, a Mizuho desk analyst highlighted in a new note. “Why add AMD if I own NVDA and AVGO here that are cheaper and feel much lower risk?” appears to be the key pushback among market participants, the analyst said. The chipmaker’s shares rose to an intraday high of $168 on Thursday, amid a broader surge in the technology sector driven by the recently released softer-than-expected inflation data. It seemed like a short squeeze was affecting much of the tech market, the analyst noted. Notably, AMD’s chipmaking peer Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) Technology was up 6-7% at one point despite the lack of any specific news or events. Meanwhile, AMD remains a significant short position for many East Coast hedge funds, and numerous long-only (LO) investors are steering clear of it ahead of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s Blackwell launch later this year. “Stock feels like a plane crash survivor on a life raft in middle of a massive ocean just looking for land,” the analyst wrote. “I remain a bull and love the risk reward if you have patience and duration (think 6-9 months). But I get the worry, hesitancy and concerns amongst investors.” Mizuho’s expert also said that AMD “could be the next Dell (NYSE:DELL),” another major hedge fund short that surged on a bullish preview from Morgan Stanley ahead of their earnings at the end of May. Meanwhile, new reports suggest that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) plans to promote AMD's MI300X GPUs for generative AI at their upcoming Build conference. While it’s known that Microsoft uses AMD's MI300 GPUs to balance Nvidia, recent negative calls in March and April implied that Microsoft was cutting orders to shift funds to Nvidia’s Blackwell GPUs, set for release later this year. “I would watch AMD today, and while this MSFT news itself is unlikely some major catalyst, any focus by MSFT on AMD’s MI300 next week to me feels like a positive catalyst as the cons view is MSFT will cut MI300 orders this yr and AMD will miss MI300 rev bogeys of $9-10B next yr,” the analyst concluded.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-investors-seem-hesitant-101833984.html,AMD,0.15

"Is Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) Potentially Undervalued?",15/5/2024 11:00,editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St)15 May 2024 at 4:00 am·3-min read,"Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD). The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NASDAQGS over the last few months, increasing to US$211 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$144. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Advanced Micro Devices' current trading price of US$153 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Advanced Micro Devices’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.  See our latest analysis for Advanced Micro Devices  According to our valuation model, the stock is currently overvalued by about 35%, trading at US$153 compared to our intrinsic value of $113.54. Not the best news for investors looking to buy! If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Given that Advanced Micro Devices’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility. Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Advanced Micro Devices' earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value. Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in AMD’s positive outlook, with shares trading above its fair value. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe AMD should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed. Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on AMD for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there’s no upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for AMD, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.

AMD Failed To Meet Lofty Expectations,13/5/2024 18:09,Upwallstreet13 May 2024 at 11:09 am·3-min read,"At the end of April, Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ: AMD) failed to impress, unlike Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) that has been crushing investor expectations on the back of soaring AI chip sales for quite a while. It’s no secret that AMD trails the undoubtable leader Nvidia that holds as much as 80% of the thriving market for AI server semiconductors. For the March quarter, AMD reported revenue rose 2% YoY to $5.47 billion that slightly surpassed LSEG’s estimate of $5.46 billion. Unlike last year’s comparable quarter when it made a net loss of $139 million, or 9 cents per share, AMD reported a net income of $123 million, or 7 cents per share. Adjusted earnings amounted to 62 cents per share, slightly surpassing 61 cents a share analysts expected. Data center revenue jumped 80% to $2.3 billion thanks to AMD's MI300 series of AI processors that challenge Nvidia and its graphics processing units. CEO Lisa Su revealed that AMD’s MI300X is being used by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), and Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL). Since the launch which took place during 2023’s fourth quarter, AMD sold over $1 billion worth of chips. But it was not enough to offset weakness in the traditional server market. Moreover, AMD’s results were also hurt by gaming revenue that tanked as much as 48% to $922 million. AMD already guided significant double-digit percentage declines in this segment due to revenue from the chips it designs for gaming consoles such as Xbox from Microsoft Corporation and PlayStation 5 from Sony Group Corporation (NYSE: SONY) already hitting their peak. This year marks the fifth year since the most recent generation of gaming consoles has been released and AMD's videogame console revenue peaks after roughly four years.Moreover, a report from research firm Newzoo that was published in April revealed that gamers are clocking in less hours. Newzoo expects personal computing and console gaming revenue growth to continue lagging pre-pandemic levels through 2026. Year to date, industry giants like Sony and Electronic Arts have laid off hundreds of employees. Sony Group is scheduled to report its fiscal fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday. All eyes will be on the profitability of the gaming division as PlayStation 5 promotions ate into profits during the third quarter. When it reported its third fiscal quarter results, Sony lowered projections of PlayStation 5 sales and gaming revenue for the rest of the fiscal 2023. Revenue from the embedded segment that consists of networking chips also plummeted 46% to $846 million, with demand for the segment already expected to remain soft throughout the first half of the year. Revenue was additionally hit from ongoing inventory corrections from this segment as clients clear out a build-up of chips. For the full year, AMD expects AI chip sales of about $4 billion, raising its prior estimate by $500 million. As for the second quarter, AMD guided revenue of about $5.70 billion, plus or minus $300 million which is in line with LSEG’s average estimate. On an adjusted basis, AMD guided for second quarter’s gross margin of about 53%, hardly beating the estimate of 52.9%.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/amd-failed-meet-lofty-expectations-180909619.html,AMD,0.23
"Should Weakness in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMD) Stock Be Seen As A Sign That Market Will Correct The Share Price Given Decent Financials?",11/5/2024 11:00,editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St)11 May 2024 at 4:00 am·3-min read,"With its stock down 12% over the past three months, it is easy to disregard Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). However, the company's fundamentals look pretty decent, and long-term financials are usually aligned with future market price movements. In this article, we decided to focus on Advanced Micro Devices'  ROE. Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.  See our latest analysis for Advanced Micro Devices  The formula for ROE is: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Advanced Micro Devices is: 2.0% = US$1.1b ÷ US$56b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024). The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.02 in profit. So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features. It is hard to argue that Advanced Micro Devices' ROE is much good in and of itself. Not just that, even compared to the industry average of 15%, the company's ROE is entirely unremarkable. Although, we can see that Advanced Micro Devices saw a modest net income growth of 7.8% over the past five years. We believe that there might be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/weakness-advanced-micro-devices-inc-110014652.html,AMD,0.4
"With Apple entering the fight, the AI chip wars have gone nuclear",10/5/2024 15:05,Daniel Howley·Technology Editor10 May 2024 at 8:05 am·4-min read,"The artificial intelligence (AI) chip wars have officially kicked into high gear. On Tuesday, Apple (AAPL) unveiled its latest iPad Pro lineup, complete with the company’s all-new M4 chip. The processor, Apple says, features a 50% faster CPU than the prior generation Pro’s M2 chip, as well as a GPU with four times the performance of its predecessor. But Apple focused most on the M4’s neural engine, the portion of the chip dedicated to running AI applications. According to the company, the neural engine in the M4 is the company’s fastest yet, and it's more powerful than any neural processing unit available on today’s AI PCs. That might all seem like Apple puffing out its chest at the competition, and it is to a degree. But it also shows we’re entering a new era of PC marketing focused on the promise of generative AI applications running directly on our machines, rather than in the cloud. Microsoft (MSFT) is already pushing the category of AI PCs along with Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), Qualcomm (QCOM), and Nvidia (NVDA), and with Apple entering the fray, the battle over which company is the new AI champ has officially begun. The AI PC, or in the case of Apple AI iPad or AI Mac, is meant to be able to run smaller versions of the kinds of large language models that power apps like ChatGPT, Microsoft’s Copilot, and Google’s Gemini. In fact, Google (GOOG, GOOGL) already runs a version of its Gemini model called Gemini Nano on its Pixel smartphones. AI PCs are, generally, PCs that include neural processing units (NPUs), or in Apple’s case, a neural engine. These are essentially portions of a chip dedicated to powering AI applications. Intel’s Core Ultra chips, which it debuted in December, feature their own NPUs, while AMD has been showing off chips with its XDNA AI engine since May 2023. Qualcomm, for its part, has also joined the fight with its Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus chips. All of these chips should end up in Windows PCs on store shelves by the end of the year. Microsoft is already banking on AI PCs being a runaway success, going so far as to introduce a Windows keyboard button dedicated to its AI-powered Copilot software. It’s the first new keyboard button in nearly 30 years. Apple, on the other hand, has been building its neural engine into its chips since it launched its A11 processor in the iPhone X in 2017. The company has regularly touted its neural engine’s capabilities throughout the years, but the debut of the M4 chip marked the first time Apple started throwing out key performance metrics. During its press event unveiling the M4, Apple was sure to point out that it not only has been outfitting its chips with neural processing engines for years but that the M4 is capable of running 38 trillion operations per second (TOPS). TOPS is more or less a measurement of how well a chip can handle AI tasks. Qualcomm, for its part, says that its Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus chips offer 45 TOPS of performance. And according to CNET, Intel and AMD’s chips top out at 34 and 38 TOPS, respectively.",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/with-apple-entering-the-fight-the-ai-chip-wars-have-gone-nuclear-150546931.html,AMD,0.63
